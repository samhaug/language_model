{"UMwXHyTU3nI": "so welcome to my office otherwise known as my car uh the reason we're out here today as some of you know i recently had a baby my wife had a baby and instead of doing this in the house with potentially having baby screaming noises going on in the background we're out here in the car in the office and we're gonna do this keto candy review the reason we're doing this complete breakdown of all the best low carb keto peanut butter cups well it's because halloween is either tomorrow or today depending on when this video comes out number two there's just more low carb keto peanut butter cup candies on the market than any other kind of candy that you can buy and number three you guys just seem to like when i do these keto mukbang types of videos where i just eat all the keto foods in the video uh for instance my keto starbucks video my keto mcdonald's video my keto snack haul from walmart where i ate like 17 different keto snacks in the video uh and i just eat all the foods so that's why we're doing this video that said let's jump right into this review and talk about these peanut butter cups so the first peanut butter cup we're gonna talk about are the lilies milk chocolate peanut butter cups these are probably the most popular low-carb keto peanut butter cup that people are eating on the diet just because they have such a following in the low carb keto community now i got these at cvs for 2.71 cents as far as what they're sweetened with they're sweetened with erythritol and stevia so they're using some really quality keto friendly sweeteners to speed these up with each one has just one net carb per cup and there's two cups in here so two net carbs per package i'm assuming you're probably gonna eat both of these in one sitting because i don't think anybody just eats one peanut butter cup and a package of two and then saves the other one for later only a psychopath would do that i'm pretty sure only a psychopath does that so that's pretty much the rundown on these peanut butter cups now let's open these up and see if the hype is real about the lily's milk chocolate peanut butter cups that was so good the chocolate is rich and perfectly sweetened and the peanut butter is creamy and salty like a normal reese's peanut butter cup is it is a tad too salty though yes peanut butter cups do have salted peanut butter inside of them but this seems to be like a little bit overly salty overall i'm going to give this a 9 out of 10. they just need to dial back the saltiness in the peanut butter here and this would be a 10 out of 10. really for a low carb keto friendly option though highly recommend picking some of these up they are tasty tasty next up we have the russell stovers sugar-free peanut butter cups i got these at wegmans it's a five pack of peanut butter cups it was two dollars and 39 cents now as you'll see on the package it says sweetened with stevia but unfortunately stevia is like the 10th ingredient listed on the package and really these are sweetened with maltitol which is the most garbage low carb not really keto sweetener that is out there meltitol has a glucose response almost equal to that of just using regular sugar plus maltitol has half the calories and half the carbs of regular sugar so you can't just subtract all the sugar alcohols from the carb count to get net carbs here you can only subtract half of the carbs from the sugar alcohols because maltitol does have carbs and calories unlike just pure stevia does or pure erythritol does now you'll see on the back package of these russell stovers peanut butter cups there's 18 grams of carbs less than one gram of fiber so you can't subtract that from the carb count for the neck carbs and then there's 15 grams of sugar alcohols but because maltitol is the main sugar substitute used to sweeten these up you can only subtract seven and a half grams of those sugar alcohols from the carb count to get a real legitimate net carb count of 10 and a half grams of net carbs per two peanut butter cups so that means every one of these peanut butter cups has 5.25 grams of net carbs so these aren't that low carb or that keto friendly so obviously i do not recommend that you buy these i am still going to taste them though because i am going to taste every candy that we're going over today and if i'm being totally honest i think they're going to taste like doo doo typically maltitol sweetened stuff is just it's gross i've got very low expectations but we'll open these up we'll give them a taste and i'll let you know what i think overall i'm giving these a 2 out of 10 just because the peanut butter on the inside was actually very reese's-like it was very creamy and good the chocolate however was totally flavorless and the aftertaste i didn't care for i also don't care for the deceptive marketing that russell stovers uses on their packages and i don't care for the sugar substitute that they use which is maltitol and also the carb count being over five net carbs per cup i mean that's pretty trash and i do not recommend buying these if you're following a low carb keto diet there's just better options out there so since reese's is the gold standard of peanut butter cups that we're comparing everything to reese's also sells a sugar-free version of their candy i picked these up at wegmans there's 10 of them in this package i got them for 2.49 as far as the sugar substitute that they use to make these it is unfortunately maltitol melt stall is actually the first ingredient on the package now if you look at the back package it says 16 grams of carbs three of which is fiber so that leaves you with 13 and it says 12 grams of sugar alcohols but you can't subtract all the sugar alcohols from the carb count because they use meltathol as the sugar substitute you can only subtract half of those so that's six and that leaves you with about seven grams of net carbs now a serving is three miniature reese's and that means that each one of these has just about over two net carbs so that's not terrible but it's also not the best either because these are miniature reeses they're not even a full-sized reese's and also maltitol is used to make these so you're going to get a glucose response if you eat them now with all that said i still am going to open these up and taste them and let you know what i think i think they'll probably taste pretty good i've never actually had these before but i guess we'll find out it smells pretty good i will say that these are very very small though this is like quadruple wrapped look at this there's like wrapper on wrapper something happened with the machine here they gave me five wrappers that was a ridiculous waste of paper five wrappers for this mini peanut butter cup at first i thought i liked it but as i kept like chewing and swallowing it it just got like more and more bitter from that meltatal aftertaste oh not very good do not recommend this i actually think it's worse than the russell stovers peanut butter cup taste wise which is surprising because reese's makes this that was awful i'm giving these a two out of ten as well they're sweden with meltzol which you know i don't like they have just over two net carbs per mini peanut butter cup which i'm not a fan of for how small these are and the taste well let's just say it left something to be desired and uh you know to call this a reese's that is a crime moving on we've got the most expensive peanut butter cups that i got which were the slim fast fat bomb peanut butter cups these were ten dollars approximately at walmart there's 14 peanut butter cup fat bombs in the box they are sweetened with erythritol and stevia so some quality keto friendly sweeteners they're using in here and as far as the carb count goes you'll see that on the back of the box it says seven grams of carbs three of which is fiber so that leaves you with four grams of carbs then there's also two grams of erythritol and you can subtract all the grams of erythritol from the neck carb count which will give you two net carbs per peanut butter cup fat bomb here now that's pretty much the rundown on these so let's open them up and give them a taste so i've actually tried these before i tried these in my most recent keto snack haul from walmart and if i remember correctly i thought they were just okay i didn't think they were amazing they didn't wow me so we'll see if things have changed since that most recent snack haul the chocolate flavor in here is totally wrong the peanut butter is rock solid no creaminess at all it's also not very flavorful the only redeeming quality about these is the fact that they use a pretty quality sweetener in the erythritol and stevia to sweeten these up with that they only have two net carbs per cup which i guess is okay but when you compare that to lilies which have just one neck card per cup it actually tastes good i can't say i can give these any more than a four out of ten and if you can find the lilies i definitely recommend getting those over these every day of the week so following up the slim fast peanut butter cups we're gonna do the atkins peanut butter cups these are ten dollars for ten peanut butter cups in the box i got these at cvs as far as the sweetener that atkins uses to make their peanut butter cups unfortunately again it is melted tall and i don't know about you but i just expect better from atkins because they have to know that meltatol is a garbage sugar substitute it induces a glucose response and it actually contains carbs but yet somehow still they say 2 grams atkins net carbs per cup and i'm not sure what an atkins neck carb is but it's not a real legitimate net carb you'll see on the back package it says 18 grams of total carbs four of which are fiber so that leaves you with 14 grams of net carbs and then you'll see that sugar alcohols is 12 but you can't subtract all 12 of those sugar alcohols because they use melt-tall instead of something better like erythritol you can only subtract half of those so you can subtract six from 14 and that leaves you with eight grams of net carbs per serving which is two peanut butter cups that means that each one of these peanut butter cups has four legitimate neck carbs like i said i don't know what an atkins neck carb is but it's a little deceiving here in my opinion what they're listing as the net carb count on the package you're better than this atkins you're better update the ingredient list on your peanut butter cups here you go this is what you're looking at for the atkins peanut butter cups they are very thin they are on the smaller side as far as the cup size goes so here goes nothing except a ton of malt tall first off the peanut butter in here is actually creamy which i appreciate very nice job on the texture of the peanut butter in your peanut butter cup atkins secondly nothing else is right about your peanut butter cup the chocolate doesn't taste chocolaty the peanut butter doesn't really taste peanut buttery and then there's also a weird aftertaste to these peanut butter cups that i'm just not a big fan of i'm sure it's the maltitol that's contributing to that it's not bitter like the reese's sugar-free ones were but it just doesn't taste good either so for those reasons i am giving this a two out of ten it's a no for me so hopefully these quest peanut butter cups are going to be better than those atkins ones that we just tried these are getting rave reviews in the low carb keto community they've been out for about a month now i haven't tried them yet this is going to be the first time i've tried them but i've heard so many people say that these are really really good and a lot of people have said that they're even better than the lilies peanut butter cups are so i'm excited to try these i got these at wegmans they're 2.99 for a two pack of them they are sweetened with erythritol which you know i'm a big fan of as far as the carb count goes they are the lowest net carb peanut butter cup that we're going to talk about today each one has a half a gram of net carbs which is crazy there's only one gram of net carbs in this entire package which i think is just like mind blowing how is that even possible but we'll open these up we'll give them a try and we'll see if they taste as good as their carb count is smells just like a reese's i'm impressed with that so let's give these a taste mmm that is so darn good the peanut butter flavor is spot on with this perfect amount of salt perfect amount of sweetness the only thing is i wish the peanut butter was a bit creamier but besides that very very good the chocolate is rich and perfectly sweetened it doesn't melt in your mouth though like the lily's chocolate does their chocolate is just very very good um it's more of a chewy chocolate with these quest peanut butter cups overall i'm going to give it a 9 out of 10. just like i did with the lilies the carb count obviously being lower i think gives quest a little bit of an advantage but as far as taste goes i think the lily's peanut butter cups were just slightly better than the quest peanut butter cups just because their chocolate like i said is so so good um but those kind of wash each other out and i think you got a 9 out of 10 for both of them either one you go with i think you're going to be pleasantly surprised if you pick these up and try them out so that is my comprehensive low carb keto peanut butter cup review i hope you guys enjoyed today's video i hope you have a very happy halloween and i will see you in the next one", "RTYbwHxWo_o": "hey everyone welcome back to the ketogenic.com youtube channel today we're going to be talking all about the brand new keto peanut butter cups from quest nutrition [Music] so quest nutrition just announced today that they are launching these brand new peanut butter cups that are keto and so i have to give you a little backstory about why i'm extremely excited about this and i've been waiting for years literally years for this to come to fruition and so for those of you that don't remember uh many many moons ago several years quest actually had a subsidiary company called quesquito and they had something called keto cups uh and they were delicious amazing these were actually vanilla cream they also had another one that was peanut butter and i literally think this might be the only package that's literally left in the entire world i could probably sell these on ebay for a million dollars with some mold on them um because they expired in 2018 but i've been saving them for a very special occasion um but these things are amazing they were the most delicious things i've ever tasted on keto think about this back in 2017 you really didn't have this stuff and there wasn't as many resources as there are today and they were delicious and then soon thereafter quest discontinued these they kind of discontinued the entire quesquito line and they also had another one they came out with another peanut butter cup that was good it just wasn't great uh it was they used a little bit of pie it was powdery on the inside it wasn't really creamy the peanut butter and it just it just missed the mark it was it was good if you were keto but it wasn't like something that you're like all right this is the equivalent of a reese's and so i think what's happened in the last couple of years probably this has taken a long time to formulate is quest went back to their r d team they have an amazing r d team that works out of there you guys know if you've ever had any of their stuff they're all about making it metabolically sound making sure it doesn't spike insulin or have any glucose or negative effects but also that it's delicious right because it's it's easy to make things that are good for you that won't spike your insulin won't spike your glucose but oftentimes they don't taste great right someone who's not keto or used to low carb snacks might look at it and go well i don't know what i just tasted that wasn't really good and then you have some other products that taste amazing they're delicious but they're filled with things like maltitol and certain like cane sugars and all these other things they're a metabolic disaster right it's very rare to find something at the intersection of both something that is well formulated that also tastes amazing and i think quest hit the mark with this they hit it out of the park and it was it's it's amazing and we've gotten the chance to try these ahead of time because they actually went through our ketogenic certified program to make sure that these test out and so for those of you that want more information we'll talk later about the ketogenic certified program but in essence what we do is we basically put subjects through basically a testing protocol to make sure that this doesn't spike insulin and doesn't have a negative effect on ketones to make sure it's actually truly ketogenic and this cup passed with flying colors and so it's super exciting they they literally just announced this today that they're launching this we're going to do a little live taste test here in a little bit but before we do that i want to go through the ingredients and talk about probably what went into this in terms of r d and why i think they again hit this out of the park and i'm super super excited for everyone to try it so uh if you look at the ingredients we see that there's 15 grams of fat it's 13 grams of carbs with 4 grams of fiber and 8 grams of erythritol so literally one net carbs for both cups there's two cups per serving and that's one that's one serving there's two cups in here and it's only what net carb for the entire package this is amazing this is awesome and then it has 11 grams of protein so not bad on the protein and it's a good quality source of protein so i'll go through the ingredients here in a little bit but 190 calories so not like it's this huge fat bomb that you're like oh my god this is 500 calories it's only 190 calories so pretty amazing and as far as the ingredients you see things like whey protein isolate erythritol unsweetened chocolate cacao butter peanuts palm kernel oil they use soluble corn fiber which you guys know we have a whole article on ketogenic.com talking about different fibers soluble corn fiber is a legitimate ketogenic fiber it does not have any metabolic response and they use this both in their bars and almost all of their products but they use them here again in these in these cups and then it has a small amount of other things but really really solid really clean formula nothing crazy in here and it absolutely tastes delicious has less than one gram of sugar per serving so if you guys want i think we should open these up i don't know uh if anyone else has had them chelsea you want to come try these with me she's like yeah so let's first show everyone what this looks like i butchered the opening keep coming let's see so this is what they look like they're a good size right can you see that just like reese's cup literally the same i think it's the same size is it same size so that's for you first it smells like a smells great really well done mmm oh good hey she up that's really good so creamy you can see it's super creamy right what are your thoughts good um super creamy definitely not like the powdered one that they used to have i'm to eat this thing because it's delicious a problem with a lot of other peanut butter cups is the ratio of chocolate peanut butter is just right off this is perfect spot on that literally tastes like a reese's that's stupid oh my god amazing so that's dangerous i'm gonna have a lot of those um but i wanted to jump on and we wanted to come on and just talk to you guys about it it's super exciting it's launching today um brand new product that's gonna definitely make ripples not only in the keto space but here's the thing something that quest does really well is they make it so it's not just pigeon hole for keto right that is definitely applicable for people who are on a ketogenic diet that want like a nice little dessert something that tastes good but it's not pigeon hole for it 190 calories 15 grams of fat someone who's even low carb or even mediterranean this fits their lifestyle that's 11 grams of protein like yeah who doesn't want to throw an extra little bit of protein into their candy why not why not it's a better alternative than a lot of the other stuff that kids will be having here in a couple and a couple weeks for halloween so again really solid uh product really solid formulation ketogenic certified amazing job uh by quest nutrition we're super super excited and happy for them and honored to have them as part of the ketogenic certified program so let us know your guys thoughts let us know what other products you guys want us to review in the

it [Music] so around the start of the new year i told you guys my goals with my physique over christmas break and into the new year i ended up gaining like three to four pounds and i made a full day of eating video i outlined what my goals were create a calorie deficit hit my protein go hit my calorie goal every single day which is what i preach on the anabolic diet in almost every video well ladies and gentlemen i've been doing that i've lost all that weight so i'm down four pounds as of this morning sitting at 174 and i'm gonna do a physique update baby comment below right now what you think my body fat percentage is at if i had to guess probably like 12 or 13 i hold my trouble fat right here and right here which i think most of us do unless you have really good genetic so in no time at all i was able to get my beach body back i do still want to drop a couple more pounds but we'll do that over the coming weeks and it's really not that hard like i always preach man it is consistency over everything do what i tell you in these videos eat anabolic and you can't lose so comment below what body fat percentage you think i am and now let's get on these peanut butter cups come on all right guys this recipe is wicked simple we are going to start off with a mini muffin tray and we're also going to need a pack of mini muffin liners these come in packs of 100 so you buy it once for a buck you're going to have it forever i'm just going to go in with my liners and fill about 10 of these slots with them you can make more you can make a little less if you want depending on how big you want your cups to be but i think 10 is the perfect size [Music] and now to prevent sticking i'm gonna hit each of our paper liners with a quick spray of non-stick spray boom bingo and now i'll set this to the side i'm gonna grab a food scale in a small bowl and in this bowl i'm gonna weigh out 42 grams of sugar-free chocolate chips i like lily's dark chocolate it's sweetened with stevia you can use hershey's sugar-free if you want this has the best macros and added fiber great flavor big fan weigh out 42 grams and then on top of that we're gonna add 51 grams of hershey's light chocolate syrup i use the sugar-free in a lot of different recipes but the light for this one works better because you're just gonna get better flavor sugar-free will work too though if that's what you got and you'll save some calories but this light version if you want the flavor is where it's at and now i'm just gonna give this a quick shake to make sure our chocolate syrup and chocolate chips are all kind of sitting together [Music] now i'm just going to toss this bowl in the microwave for about 45 seconds until all of our chocolate is melted chocolate is melted now we gotta move quick and add in 16 grams of a chocolate whey protein powder in here the reason we got to move quick is this chocolate is melted it's gonna be way easier to spread if we can take advantage of its liquid-like nature now we're just gonna stir in our chocolate protein powder if you only have vanilla or the final boss whey that'll work too this is just going to give it that extra chocolate kick we want and i said we got to move quick and i mean it because this is still liquefied from us melting it you can spread it after it's firmed up a little bit but it makes it a little tougher if you want to be able to drip it in just make sure you kind of put a hurry on this i would microwave it and then come back after five minutes i just get right to the money so get in here and put a nice little bottom layer in each one of our cups [Music] so now we got a delicious chocolate base in the bottom of all of our muffin liners now we just got to make our peanut butter topping and for the peanut butter topping what we are going to do is add in 64 grams of pb fit powder to our bowl instead of using regular peanut butter that's gonna load us down with calories this is gonna be our better alternative so i'm just gonna weigh this out right in my bowl and then to mix and thicken it up we're gonna add in 92 grams of egg beaters or liquid egg whites if you want to use those egg beaters give us the better texture in my opinion get that right in there and now we just go in with a spoon and mix it up till it's a thick creamy peanut butter like consistency and then now all we got to do is go in and spoon our peanut butter on top of all our melted chocolate and then once all of our peanut butter filling is in here we're going to go in with our spoon and i just kind of press down and spin it a little bit and that flattens it out gives it a better look on top pushes some of that peanut butter to the sides and help gives it that reese's cup look with them ridges we love [Music] at this point our reese's cups are built and ready to go what we need to do is throw these in the freezer for around one to two hours to let them set you can leave them in overnight if you want these are literally best from frozen so just toss them in the freezer go throw a frisbee with your dog or by yourself if you're a lonely man let them do their thing and then pull them out when they're done but lucky for me i think ahead and i have a whole meal prep container full of these things let's check them out [Music] so if i just grab one of these right out of here peel away the wrapper look what we're left with melted chocolate base creamy peanut butter top and a nice load of anabolic goodness let me lay these out so we can really get a better look at them and boom ladies and gentlemen i present to you anabolic reese's peanut butter cups melted chocolate on bottom the peanut butter up top and they're so easy to make freeze and eat whenever you're having a craving and i'm telling you man we filled them with protein filled them with fiber they're not only filling but they are absolutely delicious trust me i had about 20 of them yesterday woke up today a new low weight if you made it this far into the video smash that thumbs up button for me comment down below what you want to see me make subscribe if you're not subscribed and i think it's time ladies and gentlemen to pull up a chair strap on the old feed bag and try these things together you guys ready let's go all right man let's get it before we hop into these i need a little energy been a long day man so i'm gonna do a little half scoop of final boss pre this is great pre-workout great for a pump great for some focus even if you're not working out that day a little dip and dab won't do you no harm little spritzing at rainbow supernova killer ma'am available at finalbossformus.com could rgf10 will save you 10 and you already know you already seen them reese's peanut butter custard man we melted that chocolate mixed with a little bit of protein so we got that base we got the peanut butter protein top it's that easy baby three two one let go [Music] just look at that man wow incredible i mean look at that bud that's a gold mine right there i mean it definitely tastes like a reese's peanut butter cup but it's also like uh ice cream consistency in a sense man you leave these out for like five minutes then you eat them they get softer from that freezer they're cold it's melts in your mouth these really are 10 out of 10 man oh my gosh i ate like 20 of these yesterday woke up new low weight because i tracked my calories and i tracked my protein these fit right into a diet who thought now in this entire recipe if you make it exactly how i did it what you end up with for the whole thing all 10 reese's cups is only 664 calories 20 grams of fat 57 grams of protein 64 grams of carbs 27 grams of fiber so with all that fiber and all that protein you're gonna be fuller you're gonna get double what you would have gotten if you would have eaten regular reese's cups except we're not loading these down with sugar and loading these down with unnecessary fat and we're really helping it work towards our goals and i'm going to stress some of you guys that i found out when i was working on this recipe a lot of times i'll look at other people's videos i'll try to get inspiration just to kind of see how other people are doing things and seeing what i can tweak and make better and when i was looking at peanut butter cup recipes man here is the problem with everybody's definition of health these days right people are telling you they got a healthy recipe and what they mean when they say that they don't care about the calories they don't care about the fat they don't care about the protein they don't care about none of it what they're referring to is healthier more organic ingredients and it really blew my mind when i was seeing some of these peanut butter cup recipes where their definition of health was just using natural peanut butter using like full fat oils using organic chocolate and just having no regard for the overall calories as a whole they're marketing it as it's healthy it's gonna help you lose weight but yet you'd have been better off just eating the regular reese's cups man so my thing with these recipes and what i do on this channel i'm making recipes that actually do work for weight loss man foods are gonna fill you up that are higher in fiber we're not just using organic stuff and telling you it's gonna work man we're making foods that are high in protein that are gonna help us see results as long as you're consistent you follow the rules that i lay out so don't be fooled when someone tells you something is quote unquote healthy when all they're really doing is uh adding maybe a couple more vitamins to it but the calories are higher man it's a scam i tell you scam all right man we are down to the final one let's go 10 out of freaking 10 those are incredible incredible man the peanut butter flavor the chocolate flavor easy to make a bunch of them in bulk throw them in meal prep containers portion them out for meals you can easily half that recipe double it whatever you want to do man that is uh incredible you got to try that one you got to tag me on instagram and if you haven't already you got to check out the rjf anabolic cookbook man all these recipes broken down in here the calories the macros the protein i'm really trying to change the way we think of food people have a weird idea in their head of what health actually means they think you just start eating organic foods you're going to lose weight you start eating more vegetables you're going to lose weight and that is not how it works at the end of the day the only two things that ultimately matter if your goal is to lose weight and you want to stay leaner you want to build muscle is hitting your calorie goal creating a deficit for me that's a 500 calorie deficit i like to drop a pound a week if you have more weight than that to lose you can set even higher deficits man you got to listen to your body but you got to hit that calorie goal calories don't lie law of thermodynamics does not lie so you do that you hit your minimum protein goal and you cannot lose and if you have a book like this a guide in your pocket you follow and you are consistent you will see results no matter what i always stress don't overthink it don't fall victim to these fad diets and everybody telling you you switch to this diet you're going to lose weight yeah those diets might work but it still all requires a calorie deficit and eating enough protein for optimal fat loss that's it at the end of the day that is it so check out the link in my description if you want to check out the cookbook every time i do a recipe like this man i'm adding more tools to the arsenal and you get it once you get every recipe i had for free in the future we're over 150 pages now and by the end

guys there's nothing to clean up on there today so um yep that's it", "SGNwG_MjslI": "Oh God this is not this is a great nothing this is great I don't know there's something in there just don't worry about it I don't know something in the peanut butter mixture it's looks like no it looks like chocolate everyone I'm Claire we were in the v8s kitchen today and I am making gourmet Reese's [Music] Reese's are the one candy that I still eat as an adult fairly regularly we'll be taking a lot of these home to put in my freezer because I like to eat them frozen it's such an assault of sugar that like you're my like salivary glands like tingle it's like what's happening the no chocolate peanut butter I really like it is extremely sweet but then you have what I think is truly the secret to why these are so good it's just that the peanut butter is so salty there's a lot of things here I haven't seen before there's something called the Reese's big cup stuffed with Reese's Pieces candy it's delightful it's really a good texture from the like sugary shell fastbreak candy bar version with nougat incredibly sweet I think the Reese's that we create can only be the classic cups because that's what I prefer to eat and that to me is like the most iconic here's a question that I wanted to kind of answer in this exploratory phase is like do I have to temper chocolate again chocolate that's tempered is chocolate that has been heated and cooled so that when you break it it stays shiny and snappy and firm but like these are sitting out at room temperature and look at the bottom it's so soft yes I am trying to avoid tempering chocolate so that is the answer that I want to have tempered chocolate no right Chris yes it can't be too thick a layer right right I think part of the good thing about reasons is you can bite into it just like the picture shows and it breaks cleanly right where your teeth were and it doesn't like snap and break off into shards or anything like that so I have to make peanut butter please say no what's the point of making peanut butter yes smokers natural my favorite peanut butter in the world [Music] I'll make you a deal I'll temper chocolate if I can start with store-bought peanut butter we should just take this whole show to Whole Foods which is like three blocks away and just use their their peanut butter machine that counts right I think you have to make your own peanut butter that's the wrong answer can I at least use peanut butter as a starting ingredient and not having to make my own peanut butter you probably have to make your own beer I want a deeper toastiness to the texture of the peanut butter I know it's a little hard I think it's like kind of fluffy do you want there to be like a snap when you bite into it or that softer texture there is a right answer I like the softer okay good so well you're really thing if I don't have to temper the chocolate I would not temperature really melty tempered not hampered dull as hell I think enough people agree that it should not be like a snappy break you know like silent hard and I have an idea of how I would make it which is to fill the cup with chocolate press a disc of peanut butter down into the chocolate so that it fills out all along the edges and then put a layer on top I think keeping it milk chocolate is pretty key but I'm just now thinking about like that filling and how like kind of like fluffy texture and how I'm gonna do that so I need to get like deeper into the construction of the peanut butter cup and also take a closer look at that filling let me draw you a little diagram so I want to basically figure out proportionate to the size of the cup how much chocolate and how much peanut butter so that I could scale it to whatever size that we're gonna make three grams that area of a circle is PI R squared right the area of the bottom one point seven and just square this whole thing is kind of stupid because I can't get I can't get tenths of grams this whole ideas do we have like a crazy sensitive scale time for my favorite part and the most informative reading ingredients milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter chocolate skim milk milk fat lactose lecithin pgpr that's sugar extra salt TBHQ and citric acid to maintain freshness basically the ingredients are milk chocolate peanuts and sugar you know I like the idea of starting from using whole peanuts like using a whole product maybe week over to the computer and maybe see what we can find out about how the filling in particular is made and then how they're built in the factory peanuts right over vibrating valves to get the peanut butter to spread out a depositor sports the final chocolate layer into the cup a puff of air spreads out the chocolate that puff of air at the end to spread out the chocolate we can do that a little canned air from like staples or something today I want to focus on that peanut disk and just see if I can get something that will hold its shape at room temperature so I'm gonna have to find some peanuts I thought about this receipe it was for a homemade halva halva is sort of a Middle Eastern candy made from sesame paste basically that recipe was screaming a quick sugar syrup into sesame paste and it does create fluffy firm texture I'm essentially gonna decrease the amount of sugar and increase the amount of peanut butter because I want it to be less set Wow so peanutty I was sort of afraid of making it to sweep I don't think that's really happened I've never used these before Rhoda just got them they are spacers that you put over your rolling pin that's so that it's raised evenly off the counter so you don't get any thin spots or thick spots I really just wanna let this set at room temp maybe y'all check back in 10 or 15 minutes now it's a little bit oily on the surface not too bad actually I want to try cutting punching out a circle with a cutter so hopefully it should fit nicely but also snugly inside the bottom of this wrapper can you finish lunch Joan taste this peanut butter stuff it's a little bit bitter in the way that like tahini is better just from the peanuts you've already improved it I guess the only thing it's the thickness and the amount this will just be ending as a test for like flavor proportion I may have to work on I'm just gonna use those for tests that I tried and and put them in two cups if we like this and we get to a point where we're gonna stop today I think I can always hold this until we start up again my filling is setting in the freezer and the last thing really to do is melt my milk chocolate I'm going to trim down these paper liners so that they're the same height as the she's got hand-delivered canned air like you would use to clean out your keyboard and this is what I'm gonna use to try to spread out a dollop the chocolate on the top and use it to kind of woo we think that was why is it so cold but why okay alright I feel like that's so far no liquid all right okay let me grab my filling it's pretty solid so I'll should be able to press it down into the melted chocolate what did I say 808 grams good tap it on the counter to flatten out the chocolate okay I think that work pretty well let's do the rest and no longer can really weigh it but I can kind of eyeball what I think 3 grams of chocolate looks like and then I'm gonna use that can dare to try to flatten it out into a single layer and the serpent a gentle what is it I'm so worried about what is the chemical in there that yeah like there's a liquid in here that's I don't know I don't know what's going on first aid treatment that's not good it should not come in contact with skin ah treat for frostbite if necessary this is not a good I just like use a straw and blow but people not gonna want to eat my like blown air the intentional misuse by deliberately inhaling but and may be fatal that's not actually funny so I'm just gonna get rid of this one this isn't this is no longer food safe Rhoda had a great idea because I think it's unsafe to use the canned air to the heat gun from all your food styling and that's high oh no it's not I think I think the job loves burning I love it okay this is it use it for your glasses just before the lens they're like gold dust oh oh oh oh York in the camera lens [Music] it's not mortgaging that well the other options are this I was excited about the air idea might not work but the other options are to like go in with a tool obviously this isn't the right shape but something like an offset spatula and just spread it around maybe the spoon was the way to go the whole the whole time you know besides like the little Dairy Queen swoop in the center not not the worst finish so I'm just trying to see if I can get rid of it with this little guy it's kind of working the middle one looking really good get the chocolate went Matt a couple things one I know that that layer on top is too much chocolate so that's problem number one problem number two I think that the peanut butter itself just needs to be thicker it's really intense like even a little bit of bitterness from the nuts that actually is balancing it out really well I would like more peanut butter I think it's too much chocolate but I actually really think that the texture of the peanut butter mixture is pretty nice tastes good I think when I try this again I'm gonna leave the peanut butter mixture the same but keep it a little bit thicker and then I want to try everything with a new assembly method so that it's better in proportion and then I'll taste it again and I can kind of see if I want to tweak the peanut mixture after I do that a couple of changes that I wanted to make a thicker layer of peanut butter obviously the canned air thing like that was not really successful but I did have an idea which was using our airbrush machine you can control the airflow better and it has like a more diffuse kind of like stream of air so it's gonna really just be kind of like a little work day doing the exact same thing just time to get to work that's very close doesn't does it no it's fine looks great so this is the airbrush machine that we originally got for the skittles episode it come in very handy we used it again for snowballs oh do the clock you know just as important as purchasing tools is maintaining my mad it's a little disappoint are you talking about me no and I'm not gonna fill it with any food colouring I think I'm just gonna use the air streams just to get sort of like a smooth glossy finish on the top of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup the tapping is more effective than the airbrush machine each one of these is kind of a lot of work but those initial three tests look pretty good they have a nice smooth talk this is gonna be sort of the one where all the finish will go and I'll keep it in the fridge and then I'm going to just do three at a time in this second pan so that I can tap these around and I'm not just serving the ones that I've already done the airbrush is making up for the fact that I'm not tempering the chocolate I don't know that it is it doesn't want to be tempered no only you wanted to be tempered I I do want soft chocolate don't worry Chris it's gonna be great don't worry it's only person wants the chocolate be temporary I'm just gonna continue to ignore that if I were really determined to make this perfectly smooth you get the torch out the torch is good for popping little air bubbles surface oh do you see that it popped a bunch of air bubbles did you get it they are much smoother on the surface than they were before so I'm taking out the ones that have set in the fridge I just put the second batch back in these look really good these two have a little bit of fat bloom on the surface and that's what happens sometimes when you don't temper chocolate once they come back up to room temperature I think maybe they'll hopefully lose some of that no I'm still not tempering the chocolate it's just not happening should we try this one just to see or is it too early I try it I think good good clinging to the paper even maybe a little too much first impressions really good chocolate coverage nice definition around the sides this wings been sitting room ten for a few minutes so it's definitely soft Wow I just want you to look at that incredible incredibly even layer of chocolate on the top and bottom it's not too sweet the way that the Reese's is sort of like overwhelmingly sweet and it's really good I don't think there's anything that I would really change I'm just gonna keep going and doing and I was doing the whole time just two sets of three and then that should get me through all the filling okay I made 14 Reese's peanut butter cups so okay obviously these are bigger but overall I'm very happy with the way that they look and I know that these are not tempered chocolate so despite Chris telling you I was doing it wrong I still disagree oh my god look at that look at how even in uniform the homemade version is compared to the original I'm actually quite impressed that it started out so even on the top and bottom layers delightful thank you there's more going on it's not quite as steep like you know when the Reese's like you don't really get like a any yeah thing essentially it's like peanut halva yeah innocently exactly I do think it's like it's an impressively thin layer of chalk yeah I do like a really nice thank you I did Matt I did math to do it chocolates you saw don't just zoom out on that one don't look too close they're good whatever I just leave you're better talk apart yeah just don't remark upon how they're not coming out of the paper cleanly oh my god I like peanuts ready dad uh-huh yeah exactly don't don't look too close it's a little bit of a Monet you know look just know that's what I said not to do I just look for this squint a little bit the release is a little different yeah well the papers a little different I know the flavor is really really good and I really like I I like actually prefer the inside oh my god you're not just saying that right no I know I didn't pay you to say that right no I feel like it's a natural improvement on it because the interior of the Reese's is so sickly sweet you enjoying that makes me not upset when I do this stuff Oh set it up read another way I hate it less not tempering the chocolate was kind of a shortcut but I think ultimately despite Chris Chris's protests really did result in something that it's very similar to the original so that I'm into I'm very pleased these are ones that I would take home and try and you know eat after dinner for like my little sweet treat here's how you make gourmet Reese's peanut butter cups toast two and a half cups peanuts in a 350 oven until golden brown 20 to 25 minutes grind in a food processor until a smooth nut butter forms measure out one cup peanut butter and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer beat in one and a half teaspoons vanilla extract and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt just until mixed bring 1/2 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan until the sugar syrup reaches 248 Fahrenheit slowly stirring the sugar syrup into the peanut butter and beat just until mixture is cool turn out onto a sheet of parchment paper and let cool slightly roll out peanut butter mixture into a slab approximately quarter inch thick cover and let set until cool punch out circles to a diameter just smaller than the bottom of a standard muffin line freeze filling until ready to use trim ruffled edge of dark muffin liners to the height of Reese's peanut butter cups fill each liner with eight grams of melted milk chocolate and place in a muffin pan tap to flatten chocolate remove peanut butter filling from the freezer and press one into the center of each filled cake liner until the chocolate is pushed up and flush with the top of the peanutbutter pipe three grams of melted chocolate over top and tap to spread out chocolate spread around with a spoon to cover top of peanut butter then use a torch to heat chocolate a tap pan to even out the surface chill until chocolate is set repeat with more chocolate muffin liners and peanut butter until you run out of filling thank you these are my new shoes they're my favorite shoes I've ever owned I love them clogs are great because they really they're good for my natural foot shape which is where I couldn't be happier that they're in in fashion", "ejFqxK9r2-o": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make homemade peanut butter cups in miniature and this is what they look like now I've made them in with the paper candy cups so when you peel back the paper you get a really nice fluted edge and inside lots of dark chocolate surrounding a creamy smooth peanut butter filling so good now while they may look difficult they really are quite simple to make now for this recipe we're going to make 36 miniature peanut butter cups so line your your muffin pan with these little paper liners they're they're called paper candy cups you can get them in all different colors I'm just using the dark brown and you can buy these in like cake decorating stores party stores cookware stores or you know even online so the first thing we're going to do is our peanut butter filling which we're going to make in the microwave so it's really simple Yule so use a microwavable Bowl and so you need 1/2 a cup which is about 125 grams of smooth I like use a creamy smooth peanut butter and I like to use a peanut butter with a stabilizer in it which most commercial brands have and then to that I'm going to add two tablespoons 28 grams of butter you can use either salted or unsalted and have it at room temperature because then it go a little faster in the microwave and along with that I'm going to add just a pinch of salt if you don't want to you can leave it out but just a pinch like an eighth of a teaspoon so now what I'm going to do is put this in the microwave for about maybe a minute but you just want to melt it like get it's well not melted sorry you want to just get it kind of smooth not completely melt it where it's really liquid so what I do is every 20 seconds take it out give it a stir because you don't want it to melt all the way okay so our peanut butter is nice and smooth this is what you're looking for like I said watch it carefully because depending on your microwave and the peanut butter may take less may take more so then now what I'm going to do is stir in 1/2 a cup 55 grams of confectioner sugar you may know that is powdered or ice and sugar and I did sift it because powdered sugar tends to have lumps and just add that stir it in and essentially that's our peanut butter filling nice and smooth now if you found it it was a little too thick you could just pop it back in your microwave get a little softer but that looks good oh I can really smell right these are just so good ok so that's that's essentially our filling so I'm just going to put that aside because we're done and next are we're going to melt our chocolate so get a saucepan of water and bring that up to a simmer and then of course you need a heatproof bowl and our chocolate now you can use I'm using actually a combination of dark chocolate and milk chocolate because I find all milk chocolates just a little too sweet for me so I kind of find that 5050 is is about right and so but you can vary that those proportions to whatever you want really so I'm using 9 ounces which is 260 grams of dark chocolate which is either again depending on on how sweet you want them to be you can use the semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate if you go by percentage I'm using I think it's about a 61% which is kind of on that not quite a bittersweet but it's a little high on the semi-sweet and then to that I'm adding another nine ounces 260 grams of milk chocolate now I have the these little round disks but I bought the milk chocolate and bar form so I did finely chop that now you want to use this is you know a lot of times you give these as gifts so try to use a really nice tasting chocolate you know in bar form or you can buy in bulk but one that you just really enjoy just eating on its own and then to that just to kind of make turn that down a bit just to make your chocolate more like liquid smooth I'm going to add just 1 tablespoon of like a vegetable shortening or you could even Adam Laura it just kind of makes your choc a little more fluid and that's it for what we do for the chocolate part so I'm just going to put this over simmering water and melt it until it's nice and smooth okay as you can see our chocolate now I'll melt it so I'll just take it off the heat give it a good stir now this is this is just a little warm so what I'm going to do is just let this cool down just for a few minutes and when we come back we will make our peanut butter cups so now we're ready to make our peanut butter cups so what I've done is taken the my melted chocolate and put in a bowl just make a little easier and for the filling now you don't have to do this but I just put it in a piping bag because if you're really good at eyeballing you could just pipe all your peanutbutter filling but I'll show you that so first thing we need to do is take your and we're going to put 1 teaspoon so I'm actually using the teaspoon of the melted chocolate into the bottom of every one of the paper cups mmm-hmm almost there put this pin I'll just do this one pan show you how to okay so that's our first layer of chocolate so what I do is just take your pan a little bang gently on the camera so you can settle all that chocolate out and make a nice thin layer as you can see okay so that's our peanut butter or sorry our chocolate so now we need our peanut butter Center so again I have my tea spoon now if you were really good you could eyeball a teaspoon and pipe it but I'm not that good at that so what I do is just want to put a teaspoon and then I just use a little spoon this is kind of a little tedious part and you just kind of put it right in the center like so I see that and again just do that for everyone try to get it into the center if you can now if you have any really high peaks of the peanut butter just kind of take your finger or back of the spoon and just kind of press it down a little so that's our peanut butter filling so now we got to go back to our chocolate melted chocolate so again or in do is just take and pour a teaspoon over the top of each one okay so are almost done so what I like to do at this point because it looks like we may have to add a little more chocolate is just give our pan a good tap now you can see some have really settled out while some of the others I'm going to add a little more chocolate so just add a little more chocolate again tap your pan because because you don't want to see the little hump of the peanut butter okay I'm going to try again we'll see that's enough see a couple this is a these are easy as you can see with a little tedious but the rewards are great so I think it's worth it so that I'm pretty happy with that almost all kind of look around and see if the nice smooth tops so okay I think we're good so now you want to chill them probably your ball maybe 20 minutes just till they're nice and firm and then we come back we will try one okay so now our peanut butter cups have now chilled so I'm just going to take one out and we'll give it a try so you can just peel back and see very nice ridged edges and then I'll just cut one so you can see the inside so there we have it see the chocolate and then the peanut butter Center so good no people will not believe that you made these yourself they are just so good that chocolate and the peanut bar perfect combination so one quick note when you're making your peanut butter cups if you find that the your melted chocolate gets a little thick when you're trying to scoop it in you know either just microwave for just a few seconds or put it on over a saucepan of simmering water just to kind of thin it out because you're making a lot so the chocolate can thicken on you so okay these need to be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator and the reason for that is we did not temper the chocolate so if you let them at room temperature after a few days what you will find is on the chocolate it will get a little a dull and then you actually will get like a white bloom kind of a film on it and that's because we didn't temper the chocolate because that takes makes it kind of more difficult so we didn't do that and really I prefer them cold anyways or but you could you know store them in the refrigerator and then bring them to room temperature when you're about to serve them if you prefer it that way now these make fantastic gifts people just love them so what you can do is just go to your party store cake decorating store online or I mean and just buy a nice pretty colored box and just put them in and then maybe get some pretty ribbon and you have a great gift so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie drawers give joy baking calm [Music]", "WoPSf_4tBS4": "this is a reese's peanut butter cup this is a low carb peanut butter cup one stacked against each other they are the same yet very different to begin he requires chocolate he'll be using lily's sugar-free dark chocolate he could however use normal chocolate but the sad food is not allowed in his kitchen to melt the chocolate you use a standard double boiler technique but if you follow black thai kitchen you know he's not very good at it however he must try otherwise he would simply cross off the nutritional facts and collar today he cuts four pieces of foil of the aluminium and shaves them into sort of cylindrical logs this then is wrapped around the lip of a medium-sized pot he places each log at 90 degrees from the previous thus evenly spacing them around the lip then with the aid of it on break to a metal bowl unlike his dome the ball is securely nestled on top of the pot like a hand on her wrist he adds enough water to the pot to create a lake that is roughly an inch or two centimeters deep not much water is needed just enough to generate heat from a low simmer he places the pot over a controlled flame of medium intensity then adds two thirds of the bag of chocolate into the bowl this is done off stove to prevent the overboarding of chocolate chips once the water is simmering he places the chocolate bowl on top holding it with a towel and using a silicone spatula he stirs the chocolate and removes it from the heat to control the temperature which is measured with this instant read thermometer when it takes a temperature reading it appears it might be too hot since the chocolate has melted he removes it from the stovetop and says a prayer next he could use a muffin tin but it's not a great option a silicone cup mold works fast once the chocolate is back at the cutting board he adds the remaining third of the chocolate and begins to stir this drops the temperature of the hot choco and eventually the chocolate is melted and again smooth the subsequent temperature measurement is fine using a half teaspoon or if you prefer less chocolate a quarter teaspoon he pulls chocolate to the mould at the rate of five cups per cycle then using his finger with a blue glove a black glove or simply naked he rubs the chocolate upwards into the cup not around he wants to move parallel with the ridges not perpendicular to them this process is repeated for all the cups in the mold then it is set aside to cool state juggles the aluminium logs or rather attempts to and cleanse in a small party add two tablespoons of unsalted butter he could make his own peanut butter but instead opts for the store-bought version made only with slightly roasted peanuts as he struggles to open the package he knows you could use almond butter in the frustration-free packaging but these are peanut butter cups so nine he roughly scoops about a cup of peanut butter into the pot not enough to make a dog happy but enough to satisfy a baby elephant for roughly 13 seconds yells kosher salt and for sweetness he will use allergies you could use erythritol but he wants to avoid the greenness when it recrystallizes after all he doesn't want sand in his creamer he adds about half a cup of sweetened mixes until it's well incorporated afterwards a quick taste test and it suits his personal preference he removes it from the stove and sets it aside to cool which is when he notices his chocolate is a bit odd upon close inspection the base layer does not appear to have tempered correctly leading to a chalky and crumbly chocolate layer so he must do it again this time he asks for a more foolproof way by creating the chocolate melting and tempering station version 1.0 i.e has immersion cooker he determines it will take some time to melt the chocolate at 96 degrees so he will wait when he returns 30 minutes later the chocolate is melted he turns off his cooker and repeats the same process as before when he returns the chocolate does not look ideal but he convinces himself that all will be okay he's in a spoon he adds the peanut butter cream out to each cup in the most non-uniform method possible each cup is a snowflake unique in its own way and designed a trophy for its existence he disturbs something he does not wake so he lays a towel to muffle the sounds of dinner once the peanut butter smooth out it is time to complete the cup by covering them with the remaining chocolate which looks a bit like taffy it will be okay he thought it'll be okay the next day he returns to inspect the fully cooled cups i failed they are not as they should be as emerging from the mould a clear distinction can be made among them the different temperatures for tempering the chocolate clearly show the behavior at cooler and warmer temperatures they're chalky crumbly and hard not what you want in a peanut butter cup which leaves us with only one solution i must do it again one more time [Music] this time he uses semi-sweet chocolate chips and places them into 105 degree water bath [Music] using a teaspoon he measures out the peanut cream into each cup the cups are topped and placed into the freezer for 10 minutes this accelerates the cooling and allows for easy removal from the mode then he cleans because ounce once time has expired he removes it from the freezer and the mold these are as expected perfect [Music] much better he sets them aside and when compared to the first batch these are rich in color shiny and soft compared to a reese's peanut butter cup they are well larger upon closer inspection the peanut butter chroma in the reese's is crumbly and hard when stacked against his low car version the peanut butter is soft and there is more chocolate in the cup overall a better tasting and healthier option an option to keep you on track with a low carb and keto diet these low carb peanut butter cups also pair incredibly well with these milkshakes until then a12", "LA7Ps03pgmY": "hello folks welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy confusing place you call your local dispensary uh we got a big one here today guys we're reeling in a whopper uh this is a big ass bag of edibles and uh well it's it's a wheat's review so we're going to be doing all 20 of these cannabis infused peanut butter cups from emerald sky this has been sitting in the refrigerator for a while had to find the right moment um haven't eaten anything in a bit and it feels like the right time to try to eat 20 peanut butter cups in one go and not just any peanut butter cups well we're here on wheats so these are medicated peanut butter cups uh these are reese's with reefer um if you will uh but it's not a lot of uh weed for your weight i guess uh these 20 peanut butter cups contain the standard 100 milligrams of thc for california edibles each little peanut butter cup coming in at five milligrams each so uh i hope they're tasty um it looks like we've got ourselves about uh nearly half a pound of peanut butter cups in totality um and uh as i said these come from emerald sky look at this bear here he's got six arms he it's kind of a confused logo he's both a bear and a pot leaf and he's also kind of see-through um it's a strange logo to be honest uh these are their indica variety uh and they come with their purse uh emerald skies precision dosing technology don't know what that means um on the back we've got uh the story of the benevolent bear which is the weed bear that we see here um and i will not read it to you but uh you can be rest assured it is uh quite a tale um boy uh that is uh some interesting stuff to decide to put on your packaging i've been talking a lot i haven't been eating a lot of peanut butter cups and i have a lot to get to so let's go ahead and get to our peanut butter cups from emerald sky uh whose team has 25 years of candy making experience um all right so we got our thing open and here they are oh individually wrapped not very big smells like halloween with a little bit of weed in there smells like trick-or-treating candy individually wrapped peanut buttery confectionery goodness thankfully these seem to be manageable oh nobody said anything about sea salt these little peanut butter cups are covered in some kind of sea salt uh they look good they smell like peanut butter cups and salt and just a hint of weed so they are totally individually wrapped which is kind of nice i refrigerated these it's kind of warm in long beach easy to pop and share with friends which is i imagine what the original um goal of this product was not for somebody eat all 20. that's on me these are designed to pass around and individually wrapped that's kind of nice so let's shut up and try our five milligram emerald cup salty peanut buttery chocolatey looking for the weed hmm wow that is really good um i'm not sure if i think it's 20 of these little good but that is a quite good peanut butter cup and on attempt number one i don't think i have detected a hint of weed taste not not a single drop which is rare even for the best of edibles let's give another one a try here see if this one comes through so this is our second emerald sky one tenth salty peanut buttery chocolatey not weedsy wow mmm wow hello it's not such a totally miserable prospect of having 8 20 of these for this review um those are top tier edible uh in terms of taste those are truly truly outstanding wow i um i yes this these are these are delicious emerald sky you know how to make them taste good but the most important thing and the thing that's going to make all of this really worth it outside of the great taste oh and i forgot to mention uh the price so for these 20 peanut butter premium peanut butter cups uh these came to 22 bucks at a dispensary in long beach california which is not bad on average for edibles in california a little bit expensive for the dispensary that i go to a little bit of a premium over most of their standard edibles but it is a definitely a high-end um product it this i mean well half of the equation is good uh these taste great the most important thing and the thing that's going to make this really really um uh turn in emerald skies favor although they're already doing pretty well for themselves is if these things are as strong as i hope with all this fat and chocolate and wonderful goodness i'm hoping that these things are packing a punch that you cannot taste for that though it's gonna take a while and i have another 17 more of these to eat holy [ __ ] unfortunately not going to eat all 17 more in front of you i'm gonna go watch a movie hang out enjoy these over the next 90 minutes or so until i possibly can't stand it anymore and then two hours after i've had my last emerald sky cannabis infused peanut butter cup i'll come right back here and let you guys know exactly what i think of these guys but right now if you're looking for an edible that's gonna give you the munchies as well as satisfy them let's hope these are them oh these again delicious so um it may be a bit but i will be back for our final report on these emerald sky see you then [Music] so the legend goes that deep within the ancient forest just beyond the bend when the river runs high and a wind wisps through the emerald canopy a path widens as it arrives upon a place a valley full of sun and whispers of secrets there the heart of the universe resides great teacher benevolent bear gatherer of treasures the knowing one who goes by the name of cyrus he guides us to the way beyond through the harvest that reveals and enlightens and feeds us from within as we roam freely and enchanted curious and sublime toward a more blissful and beautiful world welcome back to wheat skies uh it has been close to four hours actually since i had my first emerald sky peanut butter cup uh reading the story of the benevolent bear there that makes a lot of sense right that's exactly the kind of story that goes with an edible for sure uh so a lot to talk about here guys first of all i failed i think i got five of these guys left uh i gotta i ate a bunch i i ate a bunch but i at some point i only had four left at some point my stomach was like don't you dare you can't not another that's not to say that they weren't tasty these really are one of the best tasting edibles i've ever had these are delicious um the benevolent bear knows how to make an edible uh not only that uh the reason i didn't finish them in addition to uh feeling like i've had just about enough chocolate and peanut butter for the day uh is well as as i was spreading them out uh by the time i got to this point i was like oh [ __ ] i'm already quite high uh so this would be what only 80 milligrams that i did instead of my customary 100 uh and it is a very strong 80 milligrams i feel very high uh and a pretty long lasting uh high as well as i said i started this nearly four hours ago uh and i still have 20 of this edible left uh not a bad deal and especially um this is one of the very few edibles that i would have i may have had my fill now but you know um if somebody had offered me these peanut butter cups to snack on and i did not know that they had weed in them i would gladly continue to eat them uh even without knowing that there was weed in them they're just that good they're really quite excellent so uh all in all actually quite happy with the emerald sky p pb cups uh it is not a product for me uh at the end of the day it's just too much uh it's actually quite affordably priced 22 bucks um it's a little bit higher price than some of the other edibles at that uh potency um but they are premium and they're nice edibles uh and it's not that much more and uh in terms of ingredients this is gonna cost a lot more than some gelatin um that most the gummies are so really i'm gonna give these a thumbs up uh one of the few things that i would say it's not for me but i have no problem recommending it for people uh that is the emerald sky pb cups and my boy the benevolent bear uh so anytime we have a review we like this much we want to give you a little cherry on top a little something extra you can enjoy with or without weed that isn't necessarily have anything to do with weed but you know just a little something extra fun for anybody sticking around to the end of this video uh and on this review i'm gonna give you a little video game and this one is a little video game and um much like uh emerald sky peanut butter cups will uh make you think it's light and airy and there's nothing to worry about but then three hours disappear and you've asked yourself what the hell has happened and that game is pick cross pick cross picross p cross heard it said a lot of different ways i'm gonna say pick cross uh pick cross it's a straight up uh could not be more puzzle puzzle game um vaguely sudoku-esque a big grid with uh numbers on it uh in which you are trying to use deduction to create a picture um in a big uh grid shape pattern by filling in individual squares all those squares will eventually make a picture it is a game that is impossible to describe well uh quickly or easily or compellingly it sounds very boring uh but it is a game that if you have that puzzle game itch uh watch out can be a dick as addictive as emerald sky peanut butter cups excuse me well guys that finn is gonna do it for our cherry on top that is pick cross so i forgot to tell you where you can get it you can get it on the switch i guess you can get on any really nintendo thing it's been around since the nes uh but i recommend it on the switch they have a bunch of collections they're all less than 10 bucks i think we have pick cross one through four or something is how they're arranged on the switch uh they're cheap they're great give them a shot uh these are moderately priced but they're also great and you should also give them a shot well guys then that is going to do it for everything emerald sky pit cross it's been a blast hanging out it's been a blast getting high with you until we see you on our next video whether it be a live stream review whatever the case may be stay high more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you then bye", "Siq5pqpVaKo": "[Music] so I like to get here the shipping is it crazy busy today I like to get here early so I can hone on a toilet paper but just to get my edge together because I've been gone for 36 hours which is crazy like get opened and got some new things we're gonna do today ah should I tell them the groundbreaking technology we're going to use okay it's gonna be a new method for making peanut butter top special on them maybe there'll be a pastry bag of oh okay so you're gonna open the door make sure that no I'm good I don't want your diaper camera make sure you focus right in on the security code yeah super well last time so we'll just cut to you okay so I know I'd say that we have Sundays off but I often gather supplies on Sundays but I'm so lazy that I just drop them inside the door and make a break for us so I have to buy I have to buy New York Times because it gives us a lot of newspapers wrapper cold pack said because we have to wrap them and to absorb some moisture and to keep them insulated and people bring us the newspaper but sometimes it's not enough so people at Wegmans probably wonder why I want I need for New York Times but it offers the most newsprint for the money hmm so that's what I do I have to bring that in here so that's ready for it uh for the shipping gals Monday's a big shipping day so we've got all these I mean there's not a ton those are all items need cold packs and luckily we have a freezer full and then I gotta I didn't make the Cuban on crab oh Jesus Oh fiddlesticks it's not too late is it I hope not computer adjust the air conditioning my monitor is actually a television yeah because a lot of people right Wow your monitors huge it's really a TV hmm I mean people were saying that you need I can upgrade through a computer where do you have the scene of the haters well I just bought that a year ago and it's I mean so it takes ten minutes to get ready in the morning not a big deal to me I like to use things to they're no longer needed so they're completely used up till their dad don't worry I have everything backed up in the cloud so I'm gonna turn on the light and open up one here would you close all the blinds at this time of the year because the Sun can shine in and melt our stuff I try not to yes Craig can shine and not our stuff with his x-ray vision but um and sometimes when we're brothers here I don't ask him to do this I just look right now and go with a stepstool ha ha but come winter time we don't necessarily have to do that as often because the Sun is not out so much yeah but yeah we do like to make good when you're first moved in here it's like man that's honestly seep it in under the crack it would find ways to shine on things that were just playing insidious it's like what are you doing this because it would like shining through there and melt this stuff and then other times we were shining through here and we shine it on that stuff but it was just it was a whole thing we finally got blinds and then we even had that little narrow window there this narrow window over here you need it was shining that over here and to put a curtain on this little tiny window yeah but I think we've it's like we're temporary vampires Shh it's like he's at the karate studio that didn't really didn't really matter if once the Sun was coming in now I didn't really have to worry about melting any right why memories but some parents told me that it was hot in here because they didn't really have their conditioning on that much this they said that this sweltered I mean yeah because the air-conditioning when we moved in here is very robust you know I don't know if they just didn't turn it on at certain times or whatever about it's been pretty darn good here for our purposes you know but uh yeah I remember some parents have told me that they sweltered in here I don't remember I was in the fourth grade I mean we only took the course for six weeks and I do think that the doors were open and the air wasn't bad but I don't know I can take a lot so okay so the big thing I gotta do is get my email because I think on for 36 hours yeah I don't get my email at all folks have told me how to some different tweaks I can do to get away from pop3 and switch over to nice and SMPT I don't know I printed out those email but first I still have to completely clean out my inbox to make sure that I don't lose those emails I'm getting there I do until down for my 8 like 850 emails it sounds like 350 350 to go and then I can try out that method and see if it works so yeah that's the big one big reason I gotta come in early is just to get all the emails because if I saw somebody email about their order saying hey you want to upgrade to next to air do you want your chocolate to melt or you want a kopeck blah blah blah you know the same story second first they may have answered so I'm not gonna go shipping that order out till I get an answer so that's my exciting Monday let's figure out what people are gonna do we've got max Steve bread candy makers coming in and then out here Karen will be here at 8:30 and Kara and so Kara will do shipping and oh and then we have Cassie coming in I think at 10:00 so I'll have Cassie and Karen out here wrapping Kara we'll get going with the shipping and I'll see what my email holds for me all right now let's get to it thank you you know it's Monday morning and what I'm doing today for a little while is picking up after what was left over for the weekend and I'm going to be weighing flat dark chocolate lottery tickets and the scale over here and that is 1.6 so I put 1.6 on there another 1.6 sometimes they weigh different 1.8 1.8 then it's all smoothed out and that's what I'm doing today anything else oh I'm going to be probably weighing lovehearts you getting those out and putting stack boxes and then probably doing creams butter creams right here vaccine knows okay that's what today brings that's the checklist yes for now I'll see what everyone else is check okay we have two now an hour not nothing no nothing I'm not rotating tarios watch you're gonna quit watch I'll rotated Wow good job I try hard not eat right hey did you know what Nutter butters are vegan yeah why do you tell me I had to find out from the newspaper Craig oh one newspaper well it was about milkshakes and it was about strong fashion they had another butternut shake and they I didn't know this I could have been eating these all along that's the best thing in the world forever you know once in a while you gotta have a Nutter Butter had I but known so now we're gonna make them for vegan yeah should I do I dare enter with a radically maker oh jeez all ooh I'm gonna do it yes what you don't even in there didn't say they were visible oh jeez I don't wanna mess with invisible rabid candy makers last time that's usually your head yeah what are you up to Joseph oh I'm getting ready to cut some sea salt thermals I'm gonna have my big knife chop some stuff up did you know why I sharpen these yeah yeah oh yeah that's probably why I got the two bananas out cuz cuz ya where it was really dull yeah there's now it was like Steve thought it wouldn't be very good if it was super sharp but actually that's whoo right through and you know what it's way better for cutting caramel I just ruined that piece of paper so yeah I've got some sea salts in the fridge I'm gonna put it on by mmm-hmm handy-dandy little sea salt cutter so when I first started cutting the caramels they weren't very uniform and I watched Terry's caramel cutting school video which is very good but it gave me the idea to make this and this is the sea salt caramel cutter and it's made out of the same things that we use for the nut cut boards it's food safe and all that but it helps me to cut them uniformly so that they all look nice and neat I don't use that and then as I'm cutting them when I go through and get any waste like this I just set it to the side and then we throw it back in the caramel pot and if we're gonna use maybe caramel for the turtle sort of clusters or anything like that it's right there let's know yeah they're they've got that uniformity to them that doesn't trigger my LCDs well close this 500 pounds or so yeah and the bins all cleaned the process all cleaned I just used to shop back on it as much as they could and no we'll get a new cornstarch and this will go up to the garbage on Thursday Teddy's one day so I got a link when we get new cornstarch on Tuesday Wednesday somewhere around there mm-hmm when it's delivered yeah so so now it's gonna be able to use a starter and tell you guys you can't use it until we get to do starch oh geez oh yeah I guess everyone should just go home yeah yeah so Craig when you were off being a running camp counselor last week for the week before your father and I left the premises together at the same time on a Saturday oh my god it's like three hours I leave for one week yeah and where did we go you ask a lot closer to me actually yeah I felt that are being used to have far away anyway who into us we go stones candy it's been a business sweet candy business we go for decades that was originally owned by the stone family and then they sold to another family in the 70s and that family they've just recently closed it and it's being reopened by one of the employees that work there he said I was just talking fun well that was never done he's 12 years old he sounds like say 46 years so you do the math mmm 58 okay he's two years older than me anywho um they're not gonna do tacky so they sold us their taffy setup this is a taffy Connor mmm and this is a taffy puller see those arms they're apparently taffy has to be fold for about 30 minutes so that's not something somebody wants to do don't want to do that nobody wants to do that so taffy cutter and a taffy puller so Don is going to come down here in about two weeks and give us a taffy making lesson so I was just on the phone with him asking him a few questions that we have and I just came in here to tell you dead the answers so number one Don is actually going to give us the paper that goes on the taffy machine because this is the cutter apparently when you make tap it has rewrapped immediately or loses its shape there's no wiggle room and also like it's pulled for half an hour so by the time it's ready to be pulled out of shapes its room temp so it's not anything hot or anything like that so but he's gonna come down and give us a lesson but we had a few questions one was where he could pay for it and he said it's gonna ask this mom if she did all the ordering just like Castlebeck you Craig mom the other one thing I said is how do you clean it and he said that a lot of these things that he looked it was lost I said a lot of these parts are pins that just pull off so uh he'll show us how it's clean and I said where do you get a belt like that and Max already answered that and said Mona think you can probably get been an automotive store you know if Donn said automotive store heat so that was the question because I asked if it uses a Bachelor extruder and he said no we always just pulled it by hand because your your dad was worried about that but we'll just have to do that he's gonna bring us tacky recipe in Oh Steve he's got this he said he's got an old candy cutter that we might want to put in our Museum and then he's got an automated one that's from the 1800s but it's kind of like automated like maybe the Mo's electric or not but he's got another we got a hard candy cutting machine that we might want to buy from so that's something to see when you go up on Wednesday we have different designs and stuff yeah but this is this isn't just chopping this is somehow automated I don't I don't know if it takes wind or steam technology maybe because we have running water years you know that's deep enough we gotta fire it up with wood yeah go in early fire started so yeah he's gonna show us how to use our tacky cutter wrapper how to use the taffy puller and we'll probably do you know we'll do a video about that and then they were very excited about a YouTube channel he'll probably talk to him about that and then it might be fun for us to go up there at some point and they can show us how to make something cuz they're only 45 minutes away so for us that's doable we actually can go there mm-hmm because I know Greg would love for us to come to Tallahassee and Jennifer would love for us to come to her candy place but and also the snow girls I'm sure they'd all of us to come there but she's like three hours is it probably harder maybe a whole day possible but I can't say no right yeah crazy um so we were trying to come up with a new way to do charities and in that experimentation we came across a few different methods so we're just testing a couple up we've got one with a cream filling and one that's just macerated trigger so the cream funds like what is that like fondant well we had fun we have fun at once over there this is cream which is just a thicker fondant the Shred soured screen that we'd use for cream centers oh right okay it's not as runny as I thought it would be I'll take that scepter twelve days mm-hmm and that's still creamy so yeah that cream really thick cream holds up the cream looks good I'm not gonna try the the sugar one well then do you have to try the cream one you like better I already know which one I like better oh the one I tried okay you got a network don't remember okay now compare I mean so this basically is what we we were making our logs a little bit different methods with all that rollin rollin rollin but this is a new way of doing that so with you guys basically filled up the mold like that put in a little bit of sugar yeah the cherry on top and then pour it in a little bit on top so it's the same result instead of rollin rollin rollin mm-hmm just put it in there finish Elmo I mean if people haven't seen that Holmby of how we ditch our cherries they can check it out maybe in the description of the video maybe okay so now I'm gonna try this one I don't even know if there's a piece of cherry on that side but it's gonna taste super yeah it's fine office somebody I'll check the other one Curie is it cherry good I find it overly sweet with Dalton with the cream the straight sugar better even though I'm not straight sugar - mm-hmm well that's up right that's what we're reading about it's like the invert sugar allows you to put more sugar into the same volume like that's the whole point of it so it's just like cuz when we measure North Marcia gorillas you made the cherry with the confectioner sugar we didn't really put enough confectioners sugar in there so it just gives you an idea of what its gonna be like we're gonna put much more in there to make it so men to the charity ball no juicy because of all the sugar so now with with that we have smaller molds now yeah yeah cherry cherries gonna take up a lot of that room here oh yeah well I'll show you guys have to tell me which would you removed you want but I totally like the one that's just cherries or sugar so it's kind of like in the same taste as how you guys used to go just yeah a little bit quicker method is there any difference to like is this too thin or something or like because I heard Sam saying like if we could get this to be a little bit more syrupy I don't think we have any control over that I mean basically you can make a thinner fondant yeah that's not with fondant though no those ones are and they were saying do you want to taste one of those ones too the fondant seems to break down into juice more than the cream you see that's all that's left the cream hold its shape and stays stays cream with liquor well that's been out for a while so you guys have been cutting these open like every couple days just see if it gets juice here yeah see how they develop whoo all right see you know that's that's a lot of juice mm-hmm that's the finite one this one the fun it's gone that's great so just Joe I wouldn't eat like the bottom part cuz that's gonna make it taste way too much like chocolate the bottoms we know are too thick nor have i but I've seen it done Joe how many oysters have you eaten I believe bags abundant it's super messy though right is it I think there's a direct correlation with the Messier food is the better it tastes Wow yes he it's thicker now okay that's right I'm just saying it's gonna be you know a messy proposition well it won't be this is going in as bits it's a drink and a sweet all in one I think that's really good that's real juicy okay can I try find it one or two please thinking you know how long was that it's in five extra days that's 12 that's 17 so it's been five days nah those ones were from August 2nd and these are from August 7th so these are 12 days those are it I think the moment is sure the cherry flavor seems to come through more the cherry does see you that's kind of what I was thinking photos the way we did it before it just annoys just sugar the cherry is just is that one still a little too sweet like it's kind of like an in-between find a journey if they're all running into the wrong I mean the shooter wasn't is running did you think the sugar was is ready can't recall yes probably flavor tearing out I've already had cherry cherry there's something in there Barry Nana boo man I vote for the confectionery sugar in cherry I like that one too yeah oh he's guys hands in the pocket so we can't do it without you my max Google which boy okay show me try this it's not easy to do you wanna explain to the folks that are new you know I like to keep an air mystery right a secret this time all right Wow yeah so to keep the cocoa butter from rising to the top of chocolate when we make it you have to form a temper and one left that deforming a temper is introducing chocolate that's already tempered so right here we have a bunch of ground-up chocolate it's already been tempered and we're going to dump it in and let it mix up and it's gonna [Music] temper the chocolate actually goodness that temper like 37 times yeah our CI temper temper temper temper and in temper temper tempering machine come out of temper temper temper a tea temper immediate temporary continuous temporary tempering pipe you can see all the chocolate yeah yeah just make sense crawl and mix it up a little bit and usually max doesn't get chocolate you usually don't get chocolate over the backburner over like that lets eat chocolate right it just because we're trying to maneuver oh you guys could actually see thanks for trying to save me a little bit there max you got a do it for the video okay all right anything you say yeah it's alright chocolate picks up pretty yeah you can do it I believe you it's good you definitely see that you like it stop being mean to my belt you're gonna break it it'll be expensive to replace everything is expensive in the candy world yeah okay we're gonna get a good luck finding somebody else pick Andy Bell Oh today during these messages around here there is oh you know what there might still be one there I know traffic time you used to have they don't have anything to happen I I can't really remember the old the head media play number one they were going out of business and me you and your cousin went up to the we would go up to the counter and then there was a guy there who is just like look at everything you got in the gun two bucks yeah I still have the iPod yeah yeah remember we were leaving separately like they will see your part for $10 I've got all this yeah believing in something knowing you can't be homeless when you grow up so thanks for support I was hoping to see such the other day one chest all Colombians little foster you believe that I put my finger right in chocolate and appear all places Oh oops in my way I'm sorry trying to work here please just let me go home and see like they're just getting to pull took the deal top down 86 degrees which usually around the darker like 90 yeah I need agree Celsius right Kelvin oh yeah it's pretty toasty yeah don't put your hand in there well I don't know if you can tell but you see how it's like almost up to the lip at the base amount yeah like in this in this party national to the top al-qaeda reports Arina tell your tale how I feel Oh earlier on the stay together I'll cut himself I say No that specials on I missed it well people can just tune in to this channel this is good you see a candy maker in its natural habitat so I was asking you earlier do you feel like having this in the smaller rudiments just as far as I think this goes when it was just this in here I was fine right now that we're trying to set things up so that we could do both and yeah done with your appliance to blow that out piece of machinery Bitto secrets oh no oh yeah so now that we're trying to set both up we're just thinking about way so I'm really trying to push myself they don't like West space and G's get used to it yeah and that can slow things down but you know it's the same as running something new we only got this running like yes the electrician had to come in there to put in some transformers because they were supposed to last time didn't so we're gonna trick him yeah so now we can use it basically yeah don't worry I started shooting a video about mas unboxing it and I will continue shooting the video once we finally are able to use it you'll get your new owner over yeah and then Dylan is shooting a video that we could start posting more often right now but then if we see every post a couple videos through and that really start making sales go up well then we're back tonight next question many videos so that's you know so watch all the videos but don't buy yeah because then if everyone starts doing that well then we go now we're gonna pay for this place alright guys just send us back to money each other get a little sticky and just a limit what about you guys didn't used to be here today because they get really sick I knew nothing about oh yeah when we were in the basement there was a short period of time where we were like cutting caramel putting it in the fridge and roughly just half a tray at a time oh and then putting it back in and serving from the top make you better be control here helps ya you can imagine visiting in Rome as much as you want cream lines right because before you have enrobing you have to do like what half a tray or a tray at a time and that was dependent on like the weather - you know our cherry creams one time guys not because to record too hot or something I definitely miss the basement sometimes though this is way better I'm so glad to get out of there because it's still so small and there's real way to grow or yeah even if you wanted to make more you couldn't miss to put it no they said but the people make me yeah we couldn't hire anybody we couldn't get any bigger we couldn't yes we were stuck we didn't move there's so much maintenance I did every year I had to paint the walls every single September and the floors every September now I don't have to do that that's one less thing I have to do that we take off Friday Saturday Sunday to do so I don't have to do that now so your head yeah I don't have to duck all the time and going back in the starch room might have to go way down under the pipes I mean it served its purpose but yeah it's it's over and when you when you first opened back up the store the seventies on the same alright yeah mmm you you pretty much told yourself that it'd be like 10 years of hard work and then you'd be able to open their parents oh yeah I thought be and I'll sacrifice my life for 10 years and after 40 never give up dad because I always told her when she was little when she was doing something she'd get frustrated actually never give up just keep trying and then that she today about something she turned it on me one time kids and told us I never give up any and you're living proof of that - yeah never give up you know mr. gotta other night you guys have special back here yeah or you think I should get one I just wasn't sure if you guys are paddling he was back here yeah [Music] though we're going to do reviews our new funnel we're here fancy fun new father are you gonna warm it up put it in the funnel and put it in the fridge or you just gonna warm it up I'm just gonna try and warm it up and then use it okay because remember last weekend I found out that we put it in the fridge it's still runny it does something to it good just stayed there working on it so you could actually pour it like 57 degrees in that oh okay oh that's great yeah maybe I'll do that yeah those understand didn't expect that there cuz we reason why we never did this before is because I was afraid the peanut butter will be too hot it'll melt the bottom of the peanut butter cup and just go through and then there won't be a body or untempered the chocolate you know mostly those it was melted yeah so you've worked it up yeah pulled up and it's still running it must been it must change that how the yeah pretending to know anything about it yeah it does seem to do something ready yeah it stays run here yes that is not quite as thick as it was say 82 now and if we gotta get it up to 87 and then we'll put it in the final and our new funnel play like that huh nice and shiny oh is this though when you're when you go to your left hand over here if it's not this thing is sideways I don't know why they made it that way you can't you can't pull hold it so I just put this on then you can hold it good work dad this way you can't you can't how you guys holding back don't they watch our videos it was like that one this is way should be but there's Kara let's see when she was little whatever borrow 98 so we'll put it in the photo and put in the fridge Raider 91 92 those okay so ninety it's too warm governing fridge for a few months so it's the ideal time to get it to 87 all right Joel well yeah or less take it down to 70 either cuz when I pulled it out last week it took a temperature reading is 57 degrees and it was still it's still worked fine in the phone Wow that's great 73 ready to go let's try it out huh is this all the cups you have to do today that's all for today yep it's kind of like the creams huh yeah I gotta get a there we go we'll get going here yeah couldn't give a little rhythm going see how much put in to put in and then does it seem to just kind of level out after a while well I'm going to go back to it tap it a little bit e-40 seconds that's it that's a little bit quicker huh it's great so what time is it 105 okay so we'll see and time in your seconds okay just I could do that we don't want to use a funnel bag don't because then we have to throw them all it would be too hard to clean oh yeah they're usable wonder this is so much easier once they're nice no you got room enough to put chocolate on top so you gotta leave a little room yeah if you don't leave enough room you can't put the chocolate on top yeah it just falls off with the tapping oh Jesus Christ that's Jason Bourne cash quick Steve's drinks again Janine you break the 30 second barrier dad he's going for it now about 24 seconds all right there we go yeah that was about 30 then all right 29 29 second dude that's less than 30 Wow you didn't see me fill them all off but it's had to get a thumbnail we had Craig had to get a thumbnail and now we I did these all in like 20 minutes less than that wasn't it this was no I was 20 minutes and then until all these and then now now we figure to when we have been Rovers running and tempered now if you just get a fun little chocolate too on top of that and already tempered we can go along and top all these off everything is so much quicker mm-hmm I would've usually 10 to 15 minutes what you just did usually oh this will take two or three hours yeah yeah no one suggested a metal funnel or a metal a metal pastry bag really melt the chocolate in the bottom you know this this way this is only in 70s in 73 and it works which before you know the the pastry bags wouldn't have worked it's more of a pain we had throwing tomorrow sometime our cleaning well we got these new funnels yeah these are where you guys gonna fun we got them from it's a candy store what time for town work no yeah they had them they're quite expensive just for just like a funnel with a handle here what if we could have contact with a local welder we got and this was mom's idea it's here with the funnel stick right yeah Terry's idea you might know what inspired my funnel idea yeah we've been using funnels for everything plus we just got two more funnel so there's a funnel for every hand and it's like well you should squeeze your money out of the funnels and I was like can't do better on the peanut butter cups clearly a pastry bag won't work so don't even think about it I was like wait a minute okay why don't we try a funnel well cuz we're thinking about the melting thing that it might melt the chocolate for you heat up the peanut butter but I thought you know what why not just try cuz peanut butter has a lot of fat in it maybe if we melt it and then bring it back up to temp kinda like we do with the chocolate maybe okay we could at least take the temperature of it and see what it's like so Joe and I put our heads together and decided to do this and it worked so now peanut butter cups maybe there won't be such a scarce commodity when we're busy because they'll be easier and faster to make and it'll speed up other things too because we'll spent the first fighting last time and that means more time on other things well then we're also thinking about using funnel technology for the truffles because you know how we're doing the cherries in the shell molds we could use the same molds for the truffles because the longest well the thing that takes the longest with truffles is the hand rolling yeah rollin rollin rollin no good this way it can take your popsicle out of the equation now max loves making truffles too he makes him you come in here on his day off make truffles for his parents for special occasions so yeah he can be the truffle guy but if we can dispense them from the funnel it'd be kind of neat so like I said we just got those two new funnels they're a funnel with a stick $260 that's we crazy ridiculous but those are the only ones we tried a couple of the cheapos didn't work so we that's the ones we got we quit and in our time looking for cheaper funnels there aren't any yeah because that Mary Elizabeth Evans I know I've talked about her a little fish used to be a big-time candy maker here and now Syracuse New York in her book or cookbook she says there's 75 cents each what yeah a confectionary house but that was 19 like that so they've gone up since she wrote it but a little bit a tiny tad so you had no 75 cent confectionary funnels so we got the $260 kind well what are you gonna do do you remember what what made you think of that using the funnels well just cuz we've been using it for the Turtles mm-hmm and I hate pastry bags I mean you were like running or something oh maybe running or something that's right think of my stuff tying my shoes running whatever that's how I do my thinking probably twice as fast as you dad this huh yeah so do you think that or this problem this new problem is unique to the way that you guys are melting the peanut butter I do yeah because the peanut butter used to be real thick before and then I explain to the viewers exactly what's going on I don't really know exactly what it's just unlike what's different to you or when you're covering them what's happening so the peanut butter typically is like a little bit you know thicker or stiffer or something so when you put it into the cup it doesn't go anywhere you know you can just spread chocolate on top of but since we've been heating it up it changes like the quality of the peanut butter yeah it's a little bit more liquidy yeah I don't know if you can tell but it's definitely shaken yeah then it typically would dude yeah cuz usually would dry right over there and I gotta pop the top off yeah like when you open up a jar Jeff it doesn't do it wiggle no you know so when I go to move the chocolate sometimes it blends into the peanut butter sometimes the peanut butter will you know like squeeze itself into the corner there and then yeah you got to put too much chocolate on to kind of patch it up yeah so you know that's interesting something do you have like one of these deep ones those are fine yes yeah well I mean whenever we're doing anything new there's probably hardly any times that when we try something in it while this works perfect and there's no drawbacks at all and it's not different yeah it's perfect first time around seems always yeah again that just for Instagram for my own life need all this darn work part of the job what happens if you don't bust if I don't want it goes to waste that's your father I just can't stomach in hardened jobs but that's like half of the puns here is Esther saying the words we're trying

peanut butter cups from emerald sky you know i'm feeling emerald sky if you saw my licorice review videos if you didn't down below and in the info card you know what i'm saying these are delicious there's no doubt in my mind they're five milligrams a piece this is actually the second bag i purchased because i bought one bag i'm like i'm gonna do a review ate the whole thing then i figured i should have had some here's to kind of show you already had six yesterday a couple today and at first there's a little shaking in there it had me worried i'm like oh is the chocolate falling off but what they do and you probably can't see it all going for a close-up is they put some sugar on the outside which hit me just now is a good way probably to prevent that melting in the packaging when it wants to melt it will bind to the sugar that's just my first thoughts overall though these things if you like peanut butter cups things are on point potency is there however i say this with some edibles like this especially the lower dose of the five milligrams i kind of wish they were 10 milligrams because let's be real i need about 25 30 40 sometimes 50 milligrams to really get a nice high and let's just say it was you know 30 milligrams i got to eat six of these that's a lot especially if i'm trying to eat cleaner eat better but if i wanted just a good munchie edible this i mean it's really damn good if i gave this to somebody i would put my money on it that they wouldn't taste the weed in here emerald sky does it right my friends like i said i've done other videos maybe you've seen them i saw they came out with the peanut butter cups and i'm like let's go they deliver bottom line i'd say a couple of my favorite edible companies if you're just starting my content emerald sky is up there for the licorice and now these for a chocolate for other chocolate kiva uh the fancy is really great but once again it's a lot of chocolate you got to eat the chocolate's on point but i prefer the smallest dose possible that's why some of my go-to's are the level blends the pro tabs and absolute extracts uh gel caps i got another review coming for you too on some other pills i love tinctures too and i love doing the homemade ones i've been checking with the t-check 2 recently so check out all those homemade edible recipes and fun how-to's below as well and i just want to keep this one simple yes tastes great yes consistency is there only drawback is you got to eat a fair amount to get your dose unless you have a low tolerance and one of these can do it for you buy a bag and make it last you know what i'm saying thank you for hanging out today on another true buds cannabis edible review and i really do want to hear from you i want to make these reviews better i kind

chocolate butter some sugar that wasn't in that shot put the chocolate into that thing put it in the microwave hope that it's microwave friendly don't think it was melt the chocolate into delicious chocolateness i think i used semi-sweet chocolate put the little things into the little thing put the chocolate into the little things just a little little spoonful put them in there you bang it on the counter a little bit that flattens it out didn't really work kind of worked some i wanted to paint the sides so it actually cups the peanut butter others i didn't because i didn't know the difference take the peanut butter super chunky because i'm not a child put it into the bowl scoop it again slam it off the spoon put the spoon in there give up butter put a little butter in there put a little sugar in there you got to make it a little sweet you got to make it a little smooth a little creamy so you do that okay there you go that's just a regular old bottom one and that one's got it up on the sides i froze it for 15 minutes at a time i put the peanut butter concoction into the cups everything's going great everything's going smooth look at the delicious peanut butter i'm a peanut butter a holic i eat like a spoonful a night minimum slam that down on the counter see if it flattens it out oh it kind of worked oh it kind of didn't work all right it works look really good right i'm gonna put that back in the freezer for another 15 minutes freeze it all up go to the store do something psych can't do that because everyone's dying take it back out of the freezer well now we got that basically then you're gonna do another layer of chocolate it's a peanut butter cup you guys get it it's the simplest thing i ever made i was kind of like this can't come out good right it looks sloppy as hell doesn't look good put it back in the freezer for another 15 minutes nice camera work good job jimmy there you go shut the freezer go sit down oh we're back okay 15 minutes later we're back now they just should be done and ready to eat let's see how it looks take this one out yeah kind of cool kind of beautiful and this is the one that had it all encased my thinking was when you bite into it if it doesn't have the chocolate on the outside it might just explode no it worked fine it tasted good they were delicious i have some in the freezer i'm gonna go eat some tonight great job by me i'm the best", "kB-lCDXHf-w": "oh give me one of those [Music] what's going on guys welcome back to another video and the anabolic kitchen boy have i missed you guys i've been going through rj and greg you said recipe cookbooks this past couple of weeks trying to find a good sweet treat to satisfy my sweet tooth and on top of that you know that the cookie recipe and the pazuki recipe just didn't quite hit the nail on the head so i found a sweet treat that i think is going to satisfy your sweet tooth and my sweet tooth and get us both some anabolic gains are you ready for it we're taking on rj's peanut butter cup but seriously though guys what better combination of flavors is there than chocolate and peanut butter cupcake that's right i always forget don't worry you're not missing out on anything so let's dive in and see how they stack up to the original reese's peanut butter cup let's go so first things first you're definitely going to need a scale first ingredient is going to be 120 grams of a whey protein next up we're going to go ahead and use 80 grams of a natural peanut butter then you've got 10 grams of a zero calorie sweetener then we'll use two tablespoons of an unsweetened almond milk then we've got 60 grams of sugar-free chocolate chips so for the first step what we're going to do is we're going to take 120 grams of the whey protein powder throw in the peanut butter then we're going to toss in the zero calorie sweetener but i don't know about you guys this is a ton of zero calorie sweetener but i'm going to take this and put only a couple spoonfuls and we'll go from there the whey protein is already sweet enough and i would imagine the chocolate the peanut butter all that flavor is still going to come through so depending on your sweetness level go ahead and put in however much zero calorie sweetener you prefer now we're gonna go ahead and take a third cup of unsweetened almond milk and toss it in this is what the mixture is looking like i'm probably going to throw in just a little bit more almond milk it's looking a little dry this actually kind of reminds me of the texture when i was making the vegan cookie dough got to put some elbow grease into this one all right guys you definitely are going to have to add a little more almond milk into the mix combination of the powder peanut butter and also the sugar especially if you put more sugar than what i did i just did two tablespoons you're gonna need a lot more liquid probably double so you can see that this texture is coming along there's definitely a lot more moisture in comparison to what i just showed you earlier and this is what we're looking for here's the mixture and what it's looking like guys the next step is you're gonna either need a baking dish like a cupcake rack or maybe some silicone wrappers or maybe some regular paper cupcake wrappers but we're gonna go ahead and fill each one of these up now just remember this makes a total of six servings so we're gonna take our peanut butter and protein mix and create bases in each one of these cups [Music] guys this pan is ready for some chocolaty goodness so this is what the pan is looking like with the protein and peanut butter mixture we're gonna go ahead and set this aside for a couple of minutes next up you're gonna go ahead and take your 60 grams of sugar-free chocolate chips we're gonna then go ahead and take five grams of the coconut oil and get this mixture ready okay so we've got five grams of coconut oil and 60 grams of sugar-free chocolate chips we're gonna pop this in the microwave get this to a nice liquid wanna make sure as rj says do not burn this in the microwave so make sure you keep an eye on the chocolate so guys after a minute in the microwave you can see that this is coming out into a nice texture look at that oh wait look at that that is looking super fun all right so we're gonna give this a good mix just to make sure all the chocolate and coconut oil is mixed in together so this is what your chocolate mix should look like it's coming out nice and smooth ooh baby so the final step of this process is taking the chocolate and putting it over the peanut butter and protein mix so let's go ahead and dive into that so now that we've got all the chocolate spread across each one of the cups we're going to go ahead and throw this in the freezer for about 30 minutes a few moments later ladies and gentlemen oh my goodness this peanut butter cup looks freaking bomb i just i want to feed you guys through the camera look at this oh my goodness i can't wait to get my hands on this all right so we're gonna have to do this quick this is melting super fast alright guys you know the rules three categories list them off yell it loud and proud anabolics taste and craving so in terms of total calorie breakdown we're looking at 1605 calories and that's for six solid i want to say gigantic peanut butter cups now in terms of macros we're looking at 69 grams of fat 174 grams of protein and 72 grams of carbs and we can't forget the good old fiber eight solid grams but if we dive a little deeper into one peanut butter cup and remember guys this recipe makes six solid peanut butter cups one peanut butter cup comes out to a total of 268 calories we're looking at 11 and a half grams of fat 29 grams of protein and 12 grams of carbs compare that to the original reese's peanut butter cup you're looking at a pretty hefty difference but i will say these definitely have a little bit higher of a fat content so when it comes to protein talk about some anabolic goodness we're talking about straight gains here all right 29 grams versus your measly 1.7 grams now i don't know about you guys but that is a pretty steep difference so we're gonna go ahead and give this a nine all right guys now let's get into taste this thing has been sitting here for a little while you can probably tell that it's already started to melt now the practicality of this i'll probably address at the end of this video but this thing is starting to melt and we gotta get into a taste test pronto so let's dive into these oh these things are gooey and messy but take a look you can tell they're straight out of the freezer but right away you can see how this is just melting right at my fingertips got the peanut butter on the bottom and then also melted chocolate up top one bite let's go holy smokes oh yeah give me some sweets this thing is fire do you guys just want a bite no guys these are absolutely fire so that absolutely tasted delicious but like i always say we gotta compare it to something and if i can get my hand on it you know i'm gonna do it we've got a little peanut butter cup here let's go ahead and dive into a taste test a little me ain't that cute little mini me and anabolic all right boys and girls verdict is in i gotta hand it to rj this recipe definitely hits the flavor point on its head so here's a couple of things guys from a flavor standpoint in comparison to little mini me [Music] does an absolutely great job now my biggest hesitation when it came to flavor and overall taste of this was how the actual whey protein and the peanut butter was gonna mix in just because of the consistency right as you guys saw earlier the batter was just super sticky and if you guys have never played around with whey protein or or added in any type of liquids or peanut butter into the mix you know that that mixture is super sticky and literally can get all over your hands which is a little bit of a hurdle when making these and putting them into the paper cups or silicone cups or into a baking dish but once you get past that and get everything put together the overall flavor of this thing tastes exactly like a peanut butter cup and you know some might argue hey you can't go wrong with chocolate or peanut butter it's that simple right but the combination of these flavors really hit the nail on its head when it comes to taste and overall flavor and the texture is very resemblant of taffy or maybe even caramel and it's not necessarily that it sticks all over your teeth but that texture and just the stickiness of it it definitely comes through so in terms of overall taste we're going to go ahead and score this in nine i know there are some folks who might not be too particular about the way that the peanut butter and the whey protein actually come out with texture and consistency but overall flavor points are all there now is this going to satisfy your craving for a peanut butter cup hell yeah it will oh yeah give me some peanut butter cups all right guys with a craving score of 10 the total three categories come out to a total of 9.3 this recipe is a solid recipe and definitely one that you're going to want to keep any time you're looking for something sweet or just want to treat yourself because hey sometimes you just need a break but a couple of pointers for you guys if you guys decide to make these you're definitely going to want to be a little patient when you're putting the peanut butter and whey protein mixture into whether it's paper cups or silicone holders mixture is definitely sticky so just be patient stick with it second is this thing melts super fast so leave it in the freezer when you're ready for one just pop one out take one down but otherwise once you leave it out turn it into a pancake all right guys that does it for your weekly dose of anabolic goodness thanks for stopping by if you guys enjoyed the video give this video a big fat thumbs up and if you're a new viewer smash that subscribe button you're definitely going to want to stay tuned but otherwise remember life as an adventure to be had so stay tuned stay safe and i'll see you guys next time [Music] peace you", "w10Yd_t3LxE": "chocolate and peanut butter are a match made in heaven and when those flavors combine in these homemade peanut butter cups its absolute perfection hey guys I'm Kristen from a mindful mom and I love sharing with you easy recipes your family will love and I am so excited about today's recipe I'm sharing with you how to make homemade peanut butter cups peanut butter cups are my favorite treat of all time I have loved peanut butter cups since I was a little child and will eat them anyway any shape any size any form but I really love to make peanut butter cups at home because I can control the quality of ingredients this recipe is so so simple and you probably already have everything you need on hand to make these so let me show you exactly how it's done the first thing we need to do is melt some chocolate now my hook from melting chocolate is going to revolutionize the way you melt chocolate at home it's so simple it'll keep our chocolate perfectly tempered and melted the entire process of making our peanut butter cups so what you want to do is you want to get a heat-safe jar like a ball jar a canning jar or even a heat-safe glass and you want to put in two cups of chopped chocolate you can use chocolate chips you can use a combination of semi-sweet dark milk chocolate you can even use dairy free chocolate I'm gonna place my jar into a slow cooker and then I'm gonna pour water carefully around my jar making sure not to get any water into my chocolate if you get water into your chocolate it will cause your chocolate to seize up and it won't melt perfectly so just be extra careful to not get any water inside your jar flip your slow cooker on to high and you're gonna let it go for about 30 minutes you don't need to stir it you don't need to watch it you don't need to worry about and after about 25 to 30 minutes she'll come back and see that your chocolate is perfectly melted at this point I'm going to add in 1 tbsp of melted coconut oil now the coconut oil is completely optional I like adding it because it helps my chocolate harden a little faster and it forms a thicker layer of chocolate if you don't like coconut oil don't have it on hand or prefer not to use it just omit it no big deal now it's time to prep our muffin tins to make our peanut butter cups you can use a standard sized muffin cup or you can use a mini muffin cup if you need portion control and you can use paper liners or silicone liners today I'm using paper liners the chocolate will come off the paper liners perfectly so it really doesn't make much of a difference what you use for this recipe now I'm going to take one to two teaspoons of my melted chocolate and spread on the bottom of each muffin cup I'm going to pop this into the fridge or freezer for about 5 minutes just to let that chocolate harden and while my chocolates hardening I'm going to mix up my peanut butter filling I'm using a half a cup of peanut butter you can use regular old peanut butter shelf-stable natural peanut butter or even refrigerated natural peanut butter I personally like to use the shelf-stable all-natural peanut butter for this recipe but I've used refrigerated all-natural peanut butter and it has worked you can also make these peanut butter cups with sunflower seed butter or almond butter it won't be peanut butter cups but they will be allergy friendly if your peanut free to our peanut butter we're going to add in half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of salt we're gonna add in 1/4 of a cup of sifted powdered sugar make sure to sift your powdered sugar so there's no lumps inside your fillings blend that well until combined with a handheld mixer remove your muffin tin liner from your fridge or freezer and your chocolate is nice and hardened to form our peanut butter layer portion out about 1/2 a tbsp of the peanut butter mixture form into a ball and then flatten into a disc that's slightly smaller than the bottom of your muffin tin place your peanut butter onto the hardened chocolate now we're going to cover our peanut butter with chocolate and the chocolate is going to drip down the sides of the peanutbutter disc so that the whole outside of our peanut butter cup is covered in chocolate and it'll give it that traditional look of a receipt cup pop your peanut butter cups back into the fridge or freezer for five minutes to let the chocolate set up if you happen to have any remaining chocolate left in your ball jar you can mix in some pretzels some nuts some raisins and then dollop that out on wax paper for some little chocolate-covered morsels and that way you're not letting any of your chocolate go to waste once your chocolate has hardened removed from your fridge pop out of your liners and be ready to dig in perfect it's the perfect ratio of peanut butter to chocolate so much better than any store-bought peanut butter cup it's my absolute favorite I hope you guys give this a thumbs up I hope you give it a try and I hope that you stay tuned for another delicious chocolate and peanut butter treat that my little girl is sharing with you next see you in the next video", "fU8TPG2z01c": "hello and welcome back to in the kitchen with Matt I am your host Matt Taylor today I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter cups oh yeah these are better than Reese's peanut butter cups a few days ago I posted a video on the top 10 worst and top 10 favorite Halloween candies and Reese's peanut butter cups came out as number 1 and I thought I'd revisit this topic by making another video on how to make peanut butter cups my first video I made about peanut butter cups was probably four or five years ago one of my very first videos that I made on this channel and since that video I have I have a difference of a few different steps that I do I make these a little bit differently than I did in that video but that video is still perfectly valid and you can make them that way as well so I thought I'd update the video and share it with you all super easy to make if I could do it you can do it let's get started alright first we're gonna start with our peanut butter or you can use almond butter cashew butter pretty much any nut butter you can make these with and I am using the creamy kind you can use the chunky pine as well and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna take about a half teaspoon of butter softened this is not necessary if you don't have any to use don't use it you can leave it out I just like to add it and I'm gonna go ahead with my spoon here just go ahead and mix the butter in with my peanut butter it's pretty root and it's pretty easy and now we're just gonna start adding our confectioner sugar or powdered sugar what we want to do is we want to get the consistency of this to be like playdough okay so just go ahead and pour some in and just go ahead and stir it around stir it around it might get a little messy it's okay if you get powdered sugar everywhere I'm not gonna tell anybody that you did it add some more and you could use a fork for this I just always use a spoon and you could also just dig in there with your hands too if you want um so what I do is I like push down into the peanut butter and that opens it up so it can receive more that sugar all right so this is kind of more what we want it to be so make sure you have clean hands you're gonna want to take some of it and be able to form and shape it see how I can shape it in my hands really nice and you want to make it a piece about like that okay about that big set this aside and now what we want to do is we want to melt our chocolate I have two different types of chocolate here I have semi-sweet chocolate chips with a special dark Hershey's bar for one kind and then I also have these milk chocolate candy melts also where you might want to use candy melts more often as if you're gonna take them to a party and they're going to be sitting out at room temperature then you want to use candy melts because it doesn't have any cocoa butter in it and it won't melt as easily or get soft as easy at room temperature other otherwise with normal chocolate you have to temper it and it's kind of a pain I'm just gonna melt these in the microwave on bursts of 30 seconds stir 30 seconds stir 15 seconds until nice and melted so I'm going to start with the candy melts and then I'll show you what we do from there alright now that we have our candy melts melted what we do is you just come in here and get about a teaspoon 1/2 a teaspoon worth I'm just gonna put some in the bottom just like that just like that and I'm just gonna shake it a little bit so it flattens out not necessary really I'm gonna you take me a little piece of peanut butter just go ahead and drop it right down on there and give it a little push and get some more and you can put more peanut butter mixture or less if you want depending on how big you want to make these so just go ahead and do that with the rest of these all right and then once you have all of them filled up like that just come back down with your chocolate do a little don't look don't look okay and then coming here with your spoon and just make sure the whole tops are all covered you don't how many peanut butter showing you could have the peanut butter showing if you want I had some friends of mine that are from the Midwest Ohio area say that they thought these kind of reminded them of Buckeyes a little treat kind of close to those I guess okay those are ready to go all right now I just got to do the semi-sweet and dark chocolate one thing I love about this is I always have peanut butter powdered sugar and chocolate on hand because this treat is so yummy and it's super quick to make like it takes start to finish to where you can eat them it's like 45 minutes Tom all right get the peanut butter and then if you flying after your digging in there that it starts to get too sticky let's just add a little bit more powdered sugar to it all right and then come in here and top these guys up I'm telling you I'm telling you you need to try out this recipe and then what I do with the leftover chocolate if I have some leftover chocolate even if I have leftover peanut butter is I'll just make some more of these and put them on a plate and sit up in the this little pan I'm I only have one of these pans also sometimes what I'll do is I'll just find some fruit and dip some fruit in the chocolate but yeah so there we go and I'll use put this in the fridge for 25 or 30 minutes until the chocolate sets and then you're ready to go super easy all right I just took my homemade peanut butter cups out of the fridge I'm gonna grab one here peel back look at that really cool take a bite out of it so yummy you", "JkqCSBjX3vw": "Hey it's Joanne from Fifteen Spatulas and in this video I'm going to show you how to make your own peanut butter cups from scratch the first thing you want to do is get a muffin tin and fill it up with some standard sized cupcakes liners now let's talk about this chocolate. I like to use semisweet just because milk is a little bit too sweet for me. But the semisweet chocolate definitely has a harder texture, so if you're looking for a softer peanut butter cup, you should probably go with milk chocolate, or maybe even white chocolate. There are two basic ways to melt the chocolate. There's the lazy dangerous way, and the safer, but more work way. The lazy dangerous way is to microwave the chocolate. Basically you get a heatproof bowl, throw the chocolate in, and you microwave it in 20 second intervals. And the trick is to pull the chocolate before it's fully melted and let the residual heat in the bowl melt the rest of that chocolate. The danger with microwaving the chocolate is if you overmicrowave it, it's going to get all clumpy and ruined, and there's no way to rescue it. The safer, but more work way is to use a double boiler. So you're going to set a saucepan with an inch of simmering water on the stove, and you put a heatproof bowl in it, and you let the steam  gently melt the chocolate. Whichever way you want to do, it's completely up to you, but I usually go with the lazy way. Once you've melted the chocolate, you portion the chocolate in the cupcake wells. and i like to use this cookie scoop, this is the OXO cookie scoop #60. It just makes portioning a lot easier and makes them all even. you'll notice that when you scoop the chocolate into these cupcakes wells, it's going to be a big mound, it's not going to be flat, so what you do is you take your cupcake tin and bang it against the counter a bunch of times. We're going to pop these into the freezer for 15 minutes, to let those layers harden up, and then we're going to add the peanut butter. You want to start with a 1/2 cup  of peanut butter creamy is traditional but chunky works too we're going to add two tablespoons of room temperature butter and then we're going to do 1.75 ounces of confectioner's sugar if you're measuring that is a quarter\ncup plus two tablespoons. But really you're just sweetening to taste here. If you're doing milk chocolate, you might want to cut back on the sugar a little bit. If you're doing bittersweet chocolate, you might want to add more. We're just going to whip this all together with a hand mixer. So we're going to take our peanut butter filling and you're going to grab the cookie scoop from earlier and you just put a little scoop right on top of that first chocolate layer and we're going to do what we did earlier, we're going to bang the muffin tin on the counter a bunch of times. and if you've got kids this is the part you want to let them do. For the final layer of chocolate, we're going to do it the exact same way we did before.  I've got my cookie scoop, We're going to take the melted chocolate, dollop it right on top of the peanut butter layer. and then again, bang it against the counter a bunch of times. I'm going to finish getting the chocolate on the peanut butter cups. in the freezer, and then we'll be ready to eat! After your peanut butter cups are done freezing, all you have to do is peel back the wrapper, and eat it! I will say that these make a really awesome edible gift, with Christmas coming up, you can buy those Christmasy metal tins, and you can get those cute little decorated cupcakes liners You can throw those in there, and you have an awesome Christmas gift. You can get the full recipe on my website Fifteenspatulas.com I put the exact link in the description below the video. I hope you enjoyed learning how to make these, and I'll see you later!", "EB4VcuiRWbE": "what's going on guys today we are making a very simple delicious ice cube tray reese's cup sounds a little crazy but it's gonna be one of the best things you ever eat i promise and then we're doing it in the ice cream tray because it just makes the stacking the layering of the chocolate and the peanut butter and the chocolate easier and then you can just store it right in the freezer because that's where you're going to want to keep them as far as the chocolate goes we have two actually more than two routes but two we're going to show you here so we have lily's baking chips see these are already sweetened with stevia which is a low-carb sweetener and this is what we're actually going to be using today we like these we have these on hand they're great for mug cakes they're great for chocolate chip cookies just snacking on and you can get these pretty much anywhere now so whole foods publix kroger sprouts so i've see i've actually seen them everywhere lily's is growing and then another route is to just go 100 cacao dark chocolate so this isn't going to be sweet at all which if you are going to use this and you like dark chocolate that's great otherwise definitely add some liquid stevia maybe even a little erythritol both low carb sweeteners and you'll have a really good reese's cup what we're going to start with is melting down our chocolate so we're gonna do one cup of lois chocolate chips and when i was getting these i saw that they have milk chocolate dark chocolate they have white chocolate they have a lot of different flavors so you can go really any route when it comes to melting down this chocolate we've tried it a couple times right in the microwave and you can do it in bursts and probably melt it down but it can burn easily if you're not doing a double boiler method so what we're going to do is we're just going to add a little bit of coconut oil and that'll just help like smooth it out and melt down without burning tablespoon would be good that'll add like a nice little hint of coconut as well so now we're just gonna melt this in the microwave and burst so let's start with 30 seconds and we'll see where we're at so here we just did 30 seconds you can see and like you can see some of the chips melted down where the coconut oil was so i'm going to give it a nice little stir and then we'll pop it back in for another 30. you want to be patient with this here we are another 30 so a minute total and wow that is nice nice and creamy and you want it really smooth because when you pour it into the ice cube tray you're gonna want it to just coat all the sides and not just like all drip to the bottom to ensure that it doesn't just drip all to the bottom we have our ice cream tray actually in the freezer so that when we put the chocolate on it it's cold and ideally it'll just like firm up right away and then just another tip on the chocolate if you overheat it if you over just microwave it it could separate out so that is where also the coconut oil comes into play and helps with not separating okay the ice cream tray is fresh out of the freezer so we are going to coat so my bad i should have probably just made it in the pyrex but i'm going to transfer it to here so that it's really easy to pour out okay i'm just going to pour a little out in each move this around and you can also get in there with a spatula it doesn't have to go all the way up to size but just high enough so that you can fill it with peanut butter and then pour some more chocolate on top and then if this seems like a lot of work and it is but worth it you can also just melt the peanut butter and the chocolate together so you won't have the layers but you'll still have that delicious reese's peanut butter cup flavoring and just pour it into the mold that's definitely going to be the easier route and the quicker route okay so it's not pretty or perfect but it'll get the job done so we're going to pop this back in the freezer real quick since the chocolate was hot the ice cube tray is no longer cold five minutes and then we'll get the peanut butter ready for the inside for the inside we're gonna do a classic peanut butter center i am going to actually melt this down just a little bit so we're gonna do a little over a quarter cup and then melt it down so that it's really smooth when i pour it in to the mold 60 for 70ish grams okay so that was 30 seconds so let's see yeah see a little smoother when you mix it up so while i fill the mold up with peanut butter i am going to put the chocolate right here back in the microwave so it can melt through again and get a little more smooth so we can pour over the top so now i'm just going to dollop a little peanut butter in each okay so the peanut butter is filled up and all that's left to do is drizzle on some chocolate to finish these off now i'm going to get in here just with the spatula do a little quick or you can just do a little shake perfect so now we're going to pop this back in the freezer and you're going to want to let these set for a couple hours at least i remember we made these before we pulled them out because we were impatient and they cracked but they were really tasty and hard so i would say give it like three to four hours but maybe we'll be back in one to two and then we'll see how they're doing we have let these reese's cups sit in the deep freezer for about an hour definitely not long enough but we are very impatient so matt did the honor of cracking these for me because he's a lot stronger than i am and you can see that they will split a little down the middle they didn't sit long enough in the freezer or maybe they always will if you're not using a silicone mold so if you have a silicone mold that'll work a lot better you can pop them right out we were able to crack these and they stayed together anyway so i just used a knife to pop one of these out and yeah that looks great you can see a little peanut butter there perfect so never mind i just flipped it over and two perfect ones popped out and so definitely the key here is to make sure that the walls are thoroughly coated all the way around because the chocolate is what's going to stay together and form that outer shell so that when it pops up it doesn't break such as this or you don't just get that bottom of chocolate but they're going to be tasty anyway so now that we have some out we can try these wow just so good and i love that it's cold do you guys remember those like the ice cream snickers and the ice cream twix bars those were the best we ate those all the time in my house this is just like that but low carb healthier and great for kids like this is something we'll definitely give to theo on like halloween nights or holidays or just you know anytime he wants candy this is the perfect treat so check out the link below with the recipe the step by step and different options as far as molds go silicone is going to be easier but sometimes this is just the best route because it's what you have on hand and it works great let us know if you make these and what you fill yours with you can add some nuts you can add some berries some frozen berries would be really good and thanks for watching we'll see you next time you", "iNgPttzXpw4": "- Today on \"Low Carb with\nJennifer\", I'm going to show you how to make these keto peanut butter cups using only three ingredients. So, you heard that right, these peanut butter cups\nonly use three ingredients. For our first ingredient,\nI've got keto chocolate chips, Lily's chocolate chips. We're using a whole\nbag, the nine-ounce bag. I've got half of the bag in this bowl and we're going to melt\nthe chocolate chips in the microwave. I'm going to start with 30, do\nthem in 30-second increments. You just want to make sure that\nyou don't cook them too long in the microwave so I'm going\nto cook them for 30 seconds, stir it, do another 30 seconds, stir it, until there are just a few\nchocolate chips left in the bowl that's not melted, and then\nwe're just going to stir until those all get melted, and then we can move on to the next step. Okay, we've got our perfectly\nmelted chocolate here. So now, I'm going to divide it evenly between these 12 muffin cups and we've got them sprayed\nwith cooking spray. So I'm just going to take a\nspoonful and plop it in there. Not quite a spoonful,\nprobably about a teaspoon of the chocolate. But this is going to be enough\nfor this whole muffin tin so you just want to divide it evenly. Okay, now I'm just going\nto use this spatula and push the chocolate around the bottom. You could bring it up\nthe sides a little bit, you don't have to. Okay, now I'm going to put these in the freezer until they're hardened. It's going to take about 10 minutes. Okay, while our chocolate is\nin the freezer getting hard, I'm going to make the filling,\nthe peanut butter filling. So I've got a half a cup\nof natural peanut butter. You could also use almond butter. So this is just peanuts, no sugar added or anything like that 'cause we're going to\nsweeten it ourselves. I'm going to use a quarter of a\ncup of powdered keto sweetener, I'm using Lakanto. It's my favorite, doesn't have as much of\na cooling aftertaste. So I'm going to stir all of\nthis up, get the lumps out, and then our filling will be ready. Okay, our filling is all ready,\nour peanut butter filling, so we're going to set this aside while our chocolate is\nfinishing up getting hardened and then we're going to put this on top and then we'll put more chocolate on top, it's going to be so good. Okay, our chocolate is out of the freezer. It's nice and hardened. So I'm going to use a\nscoop just to get even, make it easier to put this, the peanut butter filling\ninto the peanut butter cups. I'm not going to fill up\nthis scoop the whole way but this peanut butter\nwill distribute evenly within this muffin tin. So, I'm just going to\nput about half of this. We'll see. It's always best so you can add more, but it's harder to take it away so if I were to put too much, it'd be a little harder to take it away. So I just want to make\nsure I get them all evenly, all of the peanut butter\nevenly distributed. So I probably could've done a whole scoop. Let me go ahead and just do that. Okay, now I'm going to\nsmoosh it down with a spoon, make it an even layer. And these are homemade,\nthey're not going to be perfect like a REESE'S Peanut Butter Cup, but they're going to\ntaste pretty darn good. Okay, now we've got the other half of the bag of chocolate chips\nand we're going to melt that just the same as we melted the first bag. Okay, well, there's no need\nto put these in the freezer after the peanut butter layer. We can just go right\nto the chocolate layer. I've got my melted chocolate here, so I'm going to evenly distribute this on top of all of the peanut butter cups. Okay, we've got the\nchocolate evenly distributed so now we're just going to\nspread it all in an even layer on top of the peanut butter. And since our peanut\nbutter is not hardened, it will go flat and look nice and pretty. And if you don't want to do\nall of this layering work, mix all of the ingredients together, mix your melted chocolate,\nmix your peanut butter, you might want to microwave\nyour peanut butter for a minute or so to get it\nsoft, just mix it all together and put it in the peanut butter cups. I mean in the cupcake wrappers. It'll taste the same. You don't have to go through all this. But if you want the layers,\nthen this is how you do it. Okay, these are ready to\ngo back in the freezer, about 10 to 15 more minutes. Okay, our peanut butter cups are ready. Let me show you how they look. So since we sprayed 'em, they come right out of the wrapper, just like that. So good. Okay, okay, okay. Let me try that, let me try that. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm! Those are so good. You're going to love these, your\nkids are going to love these. Keep them stored in either\nrefrigerator or the freezer so they stay set up. That's all you got to do. You've got yourself a\ngood, delicious keto snack. Yeah, so check them out\nand check out this recipe for my keto chocolate chip cookies. They're the best, just saying. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time, bye!", "IRAjZLGc7TE": "(upbeat music) - Okay, so we have spent\nthe last couple of weeks taking foods that are very popular and making the vegan version of it. Now with Halloween around the corner, I wanted to keep this going but kind of have like a\nspooky, candy twist to it, especially since Halloween's\nprobably not happening this year or you're spending it at home. Maybe your parents or you are the parents, are going to just like\ntake the Easter concept and use it for Halloween\ncandy around the house, is like trick or treating but it's like a candy scavenger hunt. Today I'm gonna show you how to take one of, I would say the\nworld's, dare I say, favorite chocolates but veganized. Today I'm gonna show you how to make a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup at home. Hey guys, I'm Candace Edgyveg and if you're new here hello, bonjour. I make new videos, delicious vegan recipes every single week. You can subscribe there so you don't miss out\non delicious recipes. If you like these videos\nwhere I take a favorite food that maybe you love before you went vegan and turn it into the vegan version, give this video a big thumbs up and let me know if you have any requests in the comment section down below. So like I said, we're going to take the famous Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. This was my favorite chocolate growing up, I pretty much traded my sister's when it came down to\nsorting Halloween candy when we got home. I traded them different chocolates so that I could have all the\nReese's cups, I love them. And it was one of the\nsaddest moments for me, like nostalgically, when I went vegan because again, they were\ncomfort food for me. I love them. I love the combination of\npeanut butter and chocolate and it's not quite as\neasy as you would think. Let's put it this way, it's not just chocolate with\npeanut butter in the middle and chocolate on top, there is a little bit of science\nbehind getting it to taste and have the texture of a\nReese's Peanut Butter Cup. But what is it that\nmakes the peanut butter in a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup different? It's sweet and salty and has this almost texture to it, which I'm going to try and\ndo with nutritional yeast. I've also, back before I was vegan, I've also seen peanut butter like bars and they mix the peanut\nbutter with graham crackers. It is a little bit tougher\nto find graham crackers without honey in it, so I figured I'd give\nyou a different option. If you can find graham\ncrackers without honey then you can substitute this but we're just going to use powdered sugar 'cause it gives it the texture, then nutritional yeast 'cause again it gives it that texture and a little bit of a nutty flavor, which is a different nutty\nflavor than the peanut butter. And then here I have unsweetened but salted roasted peanut butter. So I'm not using the\nsuper raw natural stuff, this is roasted, it's salted\nbut it's not sweetened because we're adding powdered sugar. So the first thing I'm going\nto do is take some chocolate. I have a combination here. I'm trying to use a lot\nof things in my kitchen. So I have a combination of\nsemi sweet chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolates. The great thing about semi sweet chocolate is that it is sometimes\naccidentally vegan, so just read your ingredients, you don't have to go out and find something that\nspecifically says vegan on it, a lot of the time it's\njust accidentally vegan. All you need are these and then a muffin tin and some cupcake liners. Now these are tiny, little cupcake liners, because while you can\nmake them really big, there is something about it being kind of like thin layers of chocolate and then the peanut butter\nand thin layers of chocolate. So I'm trying to make them\nclosest to the right size as possible that you would get in like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Though, let's melt this chocolate. If you have a microwave, you can microwave that in 32nd intervals. I don't have a microwave, so I'm going to use a double boiler. So making a double boiler is pretty standard cooking stuff but if you don't know\nhow, I'm gonna show you. So I've just filled a pot here with water, brought it to a boil and then I have this metal bowl here, you can also use glass, metal is best though and I'm just putting that on top. So it's kind of floating in the water but not too too much and then I'm just going\nto add my chocolate and the heat from the water and the metal is going to melt this. It's gonna take a little bit longer than putting in the microwave, obviously but i mean it's like a\nminute compared to like five, it's not a big deal. Alright, I find the best way to do this is just, especially\nfor using a double boiler, is put the chocolate on there, let it melt and then while that's melting, you can keep yourself busy by making the peanut butter portion. So I'm just adding the peanut\nbutter, the powdered sugar and the nutritional yeast to a bowl, whisking it until it's\nsmooth and that's it. Now this recipe should make, if my math is correct,\nabout 12 peanut butter cups. I could get a couple more or\na couple less but let's see. Adding the nutritional yeast. If you have a sensitivity\nto nutritional yeast, you can also just leave that out. And then we have our powdered sugar. And if you like it super sweet, I'm erring on the side of, you\nknow this is powdered sugar and preferably I don't want a sugar coma and I plan on having more than one but if you want it to be sweeter just add more of the powdered sugar. And then just mix that together. You can use a spoon and just\ndo that until it's smooth. What you're gonna end up\nwith is kind of like a dough. And if your powdered sugar is super lumpy, mine's lumpy but it's not too bad, it's not hard, I can just\neasily smash down and it's soft. If it's lumpy, just use a sieve. Okay, so we're just gonna\ntake one to two tablespoons of the chocolate and put\nit in the bottom there, cook the bottom completely and then after we have all the chocolates in each little cup, I'm gonna throw it into the fridge just for like five minutes to harden. With these ones, it's about two teaspoons but depending on how big your\nmuffin or cupcake liners are, it'll kind of depend on you. (upbeat music) Okay, so these have been in the fridge for about five minutes. They're still soft but a little bit, like if you touch them, they're not going push\ndown or indent or anything but they are so soft, like\nI wouldn't eat this now. It's the perfect consistency\nfor adding our peanut butter. So depending on how much\npeanut butter you like, going to depend whether\nyou use a tablespoon or a teaspoon. So mine are bit smaller so\nI'm going to use a teaspoon. Because we have almost like a dough here, all I'm doing is just going\nin there with my teaspoon and then with my fingers, wash your hands, wash your hands, just taking it out and almost like forming\nit into a little wall, shove it in the middle. Keep it in the middle, because you want to make\nsure that the peanut butter doesn't poke up the side. Fun fact, when I was younger, I lived a town over from the\nHershey Factory in Sioux Falls. So we would go there on like field trips or if my mom didn't know what\nto do with us for a weekend, she would be like, oh, let's\ngo like to the Hershey Factory and see how chocolates made but they have this great thing where you could go to the store and you could buy the chocolate that was deformed, like\nit wasn't perfect sell to the consumer. So you could get like\nReese's Peanut Butter Cups that the peanut butter's\nlike showing through because they can't sell\nthat 'cause it's not perfect and all their different types of chocolate and so that was always a fun\nthing that we did as kids. That's the type of stuff you\ndo when you grow up poor, free activities. (upbeat music) So I'm gonna go ahead and\nflatten it a little bit but again keep it away from the edge. I love peanut butter cups and Louie just only kind of likes them. So I'll probably get to eat most of this. And then repeat this until you\ndon't have any peanut butter leftover and cover it with chocolate. Using a tablespoon, I'm just going to drizzle chocolate on top and all around it. Just smooth at the top as best as you can, you can't just swirl 'cause it's pretty. Okay, so what you wanna do\nwhen they are ready to go, they look good, they look the way that\nyou want them to look, stick them in the fridge\nfor about an hour, minimum, that way they're just hard enough that they're not going to be super soft when you bite into them and then we'll enjoy them. (upbeat music) Alright guys, there you have it, homemade Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, we'll call Candice peanut butter cups. Mhh, that is dangerous because\nI'm going to eat all of them. There is something about\nthe nutritional use that just adds the perfect texture. Honestly, the only candy you wanted when you were truck retreating as a kid is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, just make these and your Halloween's done.

Mhmm.", "z96KisTf8a0": "in this video we'll see how to make reese's like peanut butter cups at home let's get started [Music] for this recipe we need 3 tbsp peanut butter i'm using creamy peanut butter i'm using the sun of peanut butter because it's healthy and tasty to the peanut butter add 2 teaspoon powdered sugar give this a good mix and you need to whip this for good 5 minutes and you would notice that this mixture would become slightly fluffy if you want you can add around 1 tablespoon soft butter soft as in at room temperature butter to this mixture and whip this is ready i am not using any additional butter next step is to melt some chocolate here i've got 1 cup chocolate you may use compound but to get better taste you should use chocolate i suggest you can use milk dark or white chocolate so on a double boiler setup you can melt it this way the way i'm showing or you can put the chocolate in your microwave heat for 30 seconds mix again heat for 30 seconds and that way you can melt the chocolate here i've got some cupcake liners but if you do not have cupcake liners or cupcake molds you can use paper cups or prasad paper cups the white ones small white prasad cups which we get in the market you can use those as well for this recipe so pour in some chocolate around one to two teaspoon and then spread it evenly next step is to add the peanut butter frosting you can use two spoons the way i am doing or you can put it in a piping bag and pipe whichever way you are comfortable after that dip your finger in either water or oil and spread it like this [Music] next step is to again add around 1 to 2 teaspoon chocolate so make sure you add the same amount of chocolate which you added before you added the peanut butter frosting so that way your filling would be exactly in the center now set this in your refrigerator not in the freezer section in your refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes that's it with this recipe you can make 8 medium sized peanut butter cups and next step is to demold just pull the paper cups or paper liner the way i'm doing and these would easily come off you can store these in your airtight container if the weather is good you can store these outside your refrigerator but if it's not cold if it's summers are not good then you can store these in your refrigerator not freezer in your regular refrigerator section we haven't added any water or anything of that sort so the end date or the expiry of this product would be same as your chocolate or peanut butter so whichever date comes first so you can keep a track accordingly give this recipe a try and enjoy", "OMOZw8ZbT3g": "hi there buds in my last video i showed you guys how to decarboxylate cannabis using the magical d card box so if you need to know how to decarboxylate

that'll give you guys some ideas on how to use your magic butter machine because like i'm kind of boring i kind of stick to like the same few recipes you guys know i love desserts i need to get into making more savory dishes i did make soup one time that was really good but like it's nice to have this little booklet to go with it just to keep you inspired you know and the last thing in the box is a strainer so that you can strain the cannabis from your butter leaving just your magical butter let's get into making some magical butter all right you guys let's plug in the new magical butter machine and it will be telling you that it is on and red lights will flash on the top of the magical butter machine all right let's get into using some butter today i'm gonna be infusing this two and a half ounces of shake with four cups of unsalted butter magical butter's website says to infuse peanut butter that you can do it at 160 degrees at for two hours i'm gonna do mine for 160 degrees for eight hours i've never infused for eight hours before i think the max i've done is four maybe i have done an eight hour one before i might even run it twice at eight hours just because i'm genuinely curious if i infuse it for longer will it be even more infused i've heard that the longer you let your peanut butter go for the better so we're going to try it out today we're going to do this for at least eight hours and i might run it for 16. i'll update you guys and let you guys know anyways in order to make magical butter all you have to do is take the lid off of your magical butter machine this will make up to five cups of can of butter at a time so we have four cups this should be perfect i already have it softened go ahead and put your softened butter into your magical butter machine now we're going to add the two and a half ounces of shake that we've already decarboxylated there's still a lot of teeth in here i'm actually going to grab a brush and brush this into the magical butter machine as well just to ensure that we get all of this goodness into the butter now that we got most of the keith out the last thing that we're going to add to this peanut butter is the sunflower lecithin that magical butter scent over i'm going to add one tablespoon of this for every cup of butter that we're making since we did four cups of butter we'll add four tablespoons of lecithin to this now we have to do is replace the lid and set it now that the lid is on all we're gonna do is hit 160 degrees and we're gonna do eight hours you can do two hours but i'm doing eight and it will light up and start running i thought i would answer some frequently asked questions about the magical butter machine number one i get asked a lot does it smell while you're infusing and i'll say pretty much no like unless you're sitting right up over and you're like you may be able to smell a little bit of a faint smell but honestly it does not smell much at all particularly compared to creating it on the stove top like this really you really have to be right up on it to really get a good whiff the only time when you really do get a big smell when you're making anything with the magic butter machine is when you open up the unit after it's been infusing it will smell up a room when you're pouring that can of butter into a mold but actually while you're infusing it really does cut the smell down a lot another question i get asked about the magic butter machine is how loud is it honestly it sounds like a blender going off about every five to seven minutes it's not super duper loud um i will say that you're probably not going to want to just sit in the room while it's going on it does make enough noise to where it is kind of like disturbing that particular room's noise but honestly i'll just make peanut butter in here i'll shut my door or even leave the door open and you really can't hear it throughout the house it's not that loud of a noise so it doesn't have too much noise it just sounds a bit like a blender going off about every like five to seven minutes in a room next time that it actually cycles and goes off i'll make sure to include a little bit of noise so that you guys can hear it and the last thing i think i get asked about is how do i clean it and does it hold up yes the magical butter machine or at least my magical butter machine has held up i've had mine for over a year now and i use mine a lot like every single time i make edibles i use it and i make edibles probably once every two months so probably six times a year i'm making edibles so i do pull this out quite often and it has held up very well i don't notice any difference between its functioning now than when i first got it and how do i keep it clean i had a drop of dish soap to the match blender machine along with water i fill it to the fill line on the magical butter machine and then i hit the clean button and then it'll just kind of like car wash clean the match clutter machine you will still have to wipe it down and um particularly in certain spots i noticed that it doesn't get it like 100 clean but it does get it pretty clean and that's a pretty easy way to clean your mashed water machine just a little soap and water make sure you don't put the top part of it in the dishwasher or the bottom part of it in the dishwasher to be 100 honest because do keep in mind that this is an electronic device it does plug into the wall it does use electricity so through submerging this in water is not going to be its best friend but all you're going to have to do is really clean out the interior the outside doesn't really get that dirty it does attract fingerprints but you can wipe that down with just some water it's a fairly easy device to keep clean i think that's all of the frequently asked questions that i have about this i'm gonna let this infuse and i'll be back in eight hours or so and we'll be pouring this into the butter molds and see how our peanut butter turns out [Music] all right you guys it's about 16 hours later literally i had this going for eight hours and then by the time it actually was done it was so late that i was like i don't feel like filming an update right now and so i just went ahead and pressed another eight hours on it and went to bed and then i woke up this morning and probably put it on another four hours i think so it's been probably about 20 hours in here so let's open it up and strain it out and then put it in the butter molds and then we'll put it in the refrigerator to solidify normally that takes about an hour and we should have can of butter one thing i will say i noticed between this one and the old one is the old one had rainbow lights on it and this one only has white lights on it i wish it still had the rainbow the white kind of looks cleaner it makes it look like less i don't know kitty but that's what it looks like in there i just splattered a little bit on my desk no it looks so dark wow let's strain this a few times to get all of the sediment out of it and impurities and then we'll put it into the new molds [Music] do [Music] this honestly looks like baby it does not look good at all i mean it never does it doesn't look good until it gets in the refrigerator and solidifies before then it just looks like now we put on our magical glove and we will strain it out [Music] i'm actually gonna stop trying to squeeze this bag every time i squeeze it i keep like spilling some out and i'm afraid i'm gonna end up like getting it inside of my peanut butter which is the last thing i want um so i'm just gonna like set this up on something so that it will strain out slowly it's gonna take some time for this to strain out um i think it's because i use shape like [Music] there was just so many little particles in there so it's just gonna take a long time for this to strain out [Music] okay that's gonna take a while so we're gonna go ahead and just pour what we already strained out into these new moments plus i don't want this to solidify in here because it will solidify it is better after all [Applause] oh my gosh i hit my desk and the rupaul shade button went off that's underneath all right that already made two sticks of butter we're gonna go ahead and close the butter mold and then i'm going to go place this in the fridge i love this new butter mold the fact that like it has a lid where it keeps it secured you can actually move this around that's amazing so i ended up leaving the filter in a picture and leaving that on the warming center of my oven just to ensure that it stays warm and it stripped out quite a bit more peanut butter i've already made four sticks from what i've gotten out so far let's pour this a little bit see how many sticks it makes we'll freeze it and then i guess i'll end out this video [Music] looks like we got another one and maybe a quarter sticks of can of butter and here are our five sticks of peanut butter we actually got all the butter out that we put in so that's really good um i thought that by straining it that way i wasn't sure if i would actually get it all out but i think we got a really good yield from this i mean what else can i ask for i put five six in and i have five sticks out thank you guys so much for watching if you like this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what you think i should make with my can of butter i honestly haven't decided yet i haven't picked out a recipe yet whatever the best comment is i'll probably just pick that and make a video out of it so leave some creative comments down in the um comment section on what you want me to do with this can of butter and thank you guys so much for watching i'll see you guys around for whatever sony activity or video i come up with for next time and don't forget you can use cup buds and beards to save 20 off of anything at magicalbutter.com and thank you magical for sponsoring this video bye guys", "Wvf6wEWP2cU": "hi hi welcome to angels anything show and today we are making Reese's Pieces cups Reese's Cups peanut butter cups and today I'm going to show you how to make medicated peanut butter cups that's right folks we are making history today with these edibles because I don't know if that's ever been done before but we're gonna try it basically the gist of it is we're gonna make the chocolate sauce from Miley chocolate video we're gonna add some peanut butter we're gonna add some more chocolate and then we're gonna freeze it and that should hopefully work so here we go let's try it out first you're gonna want silicone molds it's really hard to say that without sounding weird silicone molds you may get something like this or you can get little tins little muffin tins whatever you know we need I'm gonna use like I said the recipe from my last video because I have those ingredients but if you really want to get basic with it you could just go buy chocolate at the store and melt it and add your can of butter into that so whatever you want to do okay so you need to heat everything up together for the beginning of this recipe so I have my ninja crock-pot but I have it on the stove top setting so it's essentially like having a nonstick frying pan on low because you don't want the chocolate to burn I'm gonna add a half cup of this cacao powder it's unsweetened cacao this recipe is not that precise like it doesn't need to be that precise okay so this is basically melted so I'm gonna pour then and we learned how to make cannabutter in a very recent video so if you don't know watch that I'll link to that now we need three tablespoons of honey I'm sorry if it's not bright enough in here I thought they was supposed to be sunny and I had planned to film this videos it was gonna be good lighting but alas it's a gloomy day as [ __ ] usual and then finally we need 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract which I don't know does vanilla attract to even do anything so I'm gonna take this spatula and just start folding this the ingredients together slowly confidently with authority but with a gentle touch and it's already very chocolatey cooking with weed is always somewhat scary because it's like one false move and you've just wasted like seven grams it's time to take this chocolate and do the first layer of chocolate on the bottom of these and I'm gonna take this baster scoop the chocolate like so and then just do a thin layer a thin layer are you guys this method is not working change plans instead I'm gonna pour I'm gonna pour the chocolate sauce into this mason jar when I need to use it again [Music] because when I need to reheat the chocolate up again I can just heat up the mason jar easily alright so now we have this in this that's a lot easier to work with so now let's try mix it together I mean this basters not the best it's pretty shitty to be honest alright so we have a little layer of chocolate on the bottom of each little pan mold and I'm gonna put them in the freezer they'll sit there I mean I don't know vans gonna be on this call for an hour so I guess we'll them in there for an hour let them harden up a little bit and then we're gonna add in the peanut butter and we're gonna add in the chocolate again and we're back but I actually didn't take long at all these froze in probably like 15 minutes and you Dan was off this column like 30 minutes so here we are phase 2 we are adding in the peanut butter so you need 1/4 cup of peanut butter about I mean whatever a little sweetener if you want and a little bit of salt if you want what I did is because my peanut butter is a little oily I put it in a bowl and left it in the fridge for a few hours so it's a little more firm you don't have to do it but I think it's helpful because it also two scoops more easily so I'm just gonna use 1/2 a teaspoon like a heaping 1/2 teaspoon and just put a little ball in the middle like that and go through each one and do that I'm not even following any type of instructions at this point I'm just it's common sense I think this might be common sense also it's like what's the worst thing that can happen with this recipe like it's not gonna not taste good you're gonna eat it so now if you know how to do we've infused peanut butter that would be a real double-decker I don't know I haven't done that yet I do want to try it though I think I maybe even know how to do it on though so flatten down the peanut butter so it's covering most of the chocolate and now we're gonna take our chocolate sauce from before and then cover cover these things up ready here we go there we go oh yeah this might actually work alright these are all ready to go we're gonna put them back in the freezer let them set for however long and then we can take them out I'll try one and I'll show you how to store them alright guys we're back these are frozen and I have one of them to show you mm-hmm tastes like a Reese's Cup I mean the chocolates a little different because it's a coconut oil-based but gets the [ __ ] job done lose it go wow that was so easy coming pressure myself so I would say store these in the freezer because the coconut oil does melt pretty fast so store them in the freezer when you want and just take it out and give it like 30 seconds to a minute and you'll be able to eat it I'm gonna store them in this Tupperware and leave them in the freezer this recipe made 12 although I did have chocolate sauce left over so if you wanted to put more peanut butter and and do more you could yeah try it out at home let me know let me know how you like it and I'll see you next time thanks for watching bye as long as you have the weed then if you got the time I got the inclination you know I'm saying to rock the boat so is that what they say no", "oGCLl9dSxZw": "review time probably the one i'm most excited about so far we're gonna get right into it here quest peanut butter cups couple notes first and foremost reese's peanut butter cups are my absolute favorite candy in the world hands down they hold the number one spot in my heart i absolutely love them side note people around here in michigan say reese's if you say reese's you gotta stop many years ago quest had peanut butter cups they were quest cravings peanut butter cups i don't remember the exact macros of them i think they were higher in protein but they were pretty dry and kind of chalky so they left your mouth really like lip smacky after you ate them they were pretty different from reese's i happen to like them they got really mixed reviews and i know a lot of people didn't like them i've heard these are completely reformulated and based on a lot of the reviews they taste identical the reese's i don't believe it so we're gonna put that to the test what i did is i bought reese's dark chocolate cups so i've never had reese's dark i love regular reese's and to make this fair since these are definitely going to be a little less sweet since they used a dark chocolate and they're sugar free i think this is going to be the closest comparison and what i'm going to do is a complete blind taste test and see if i can tell the difference now i think it's going to be a bit of a fair shake because i've not had the dark reese's before so i don't know exactly what it's going to taste like but based on a lot of reviews i've been hearing and reading these supposedly taste identical to reese's somebody said that they taste better than the reese's pumpkins that's crazy everyone knows that reese's shapes are the best and if you know you know reese's eggs the best don't know why that shape is the best but it goes eggs trees then pumpkins obviously anyway we're gonna do a blind taste test here because i'm curious how they actually stack up west is 190 calories for both cups 15 grams of fat 13 carb and then it's four grams fiber less than one gram sugar so they use a sugar substitute erythritol eight grams of that and then 11 grams protein total versus 100 calories 13 grams fat 21 carb 2 fiber 18 sugar and 4 grams protein so as a protein snack it's not a ton of protein compared to regular reese's so depending on how it tastes i don't know if i would rather have these than regular but we're going to find out so the first time around when quest made peanut butter cups they were not the greatest shape and they were in this weird plastic container so these actually now look like reese's and they are in the same wrapper so right off the bat looking at it that looks like a reese's and here is a regular reese's so the thing i can tell immediately is that the reese's is a little bit softer than the quest size-wise i mean those are very very similar so since these feel a little bit different i don't want to be able to tell which is which and actually since one's a little softer let's take it one step further there you go i smushed them so that way i can just dump it right into my mouth and i won't be able to feel what the difference is genius i'm gonna blindfold myself with an inside out dirty shirt all right that is very tight mix and mix and mix in mix in so here is one of them i have no idea if you can see the letter the dark chocolate's strong the peanut butter taste is not quite as strong but that's pretty good that has to be the quest cup i don't even know that it's going to be close if that's not the quest cup then i am going to be completely thrown here that one's reese's that's got to be reese's i will say they are shockingly similar tastes like reese's peanut butter so if that's not this is going to blow my mind all right so no surprise reese's is still identifiable but so this is the reese's and then you have the quest underneath so you can kind of see that it's a little bit on the dry side i feel like when you break it it leaves you with that thick layer of chocolate it's not a reese's it's not a exact replica of reese's there are a lot of reviews that say you can't taste the difference you can taste the difference but considering that there's no sugar in it extremely impressive everybody knows that reese's tastes better frozen so i did buy an extra set of quest cups threw them in the freezer now i'm curious they've been sitting out here for like two minutes they are frozen oh boy so when you compare it to the dark chocolate reese's the chocolate's actually pretty similar the major differences in the peanut butter it's really hard to replicate reese's peanut butter without sugar as evident by reese's having 18 grams of sugar versus quest having zero i would choose reese's over these definitely but for me sugar is not a concern if you want to eat low sugar if you're keto whatever the reason might be these are a phenomenal replacement for reese's for me personally i would choose the reese's but they are very close so taking that into account overall these are probably they're between a 7.5 and an 8 out of 10 honestly i think so if you had the old version these are significantly better they have improved them very much if you've never had it i mean it's close to a reese's if you were to break these up and put them on ice cream or mix them into a smoothie or something whatever you would use reese's toppings on you'd probably be hard-pressed to tell the difference when you're eating it straight up you can tell that there's a difference but i'm gonna go on the higher end of the scale i'm gonna go with an eight out of ten quest nailed it very impressed still love reese's but these are these are a good snack", "mnr3f1UZuMU": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and for the rest of you guys thank you so much and welcome back so I've I've been asked about chocolate in the past and I have never been able to successfully get it to set at room temperature using cannabutter then the other day when I was doing the truffle demonstration I was using the shortening to thin out our chocolate for decorating it dawned on me that shortening sets at room temperature in chocolate will stay set at room temperature so I made up a an infusion with shortening instead of butter and I do it just like the small infusion like all other ones I'll run a quick little thing for you here on it but if you want more detail on it you can check out the small infusion video so yeah so I get a small infusion of shortening and yeah I'll show you how much better that works and the reason being is butter has a melting point of fancy it's between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit so basically a little room temperature a little bit warm it's going your chocolate is going to melt or sorry your butter is going to melt however shortenings melting point is 95 to 115 degrees fahrenheit so it's got a lot more stability so you know that if you've got shortening butter on the counter you notice you're shortening nice and solid where your butter might be a melted mess on all that hot day and and that's the reason is because of the higher melting point so I think that into our chocolate does not affect our chocolate and it allows it to stay set at room temperature now I'm doing this demonstration with candy melts if you want to do it with real chocolate that's not a problem but you will have to temper it I hate tempering chocolate one of these days I will do a video on how to do it exactly personally I hate it the candy melts taste great and they just work so easily so I'm going to show you that demonstration with it and so check this out so M here's our chocolate he's nice and snap and you can see it's not all melting and the squishy let's see if you can hear it hoping that came through on the micro on the thing and then for our peanut butter cups any time I am a peanut butter cups in the past all the recipes that I have I have looked up add anywhere between two to six cups of powdered sugar and I'm like that is disgusting one time I made it and it is it's so sweet all you get is sugar and with a hint of peanut butter and it still doesn't stay set at room temperature it still kind of oozes out and it just it's just not a proper peanut butter cup so off I go and do my research and stuff look up the actual ingredients in a rescreened a butter cup Wow I can make certain things work for us and I've managed to come up with this come up with this for us so check this out it's a peanut butter cup that I did a little earlier look at that Center there's no using or squishing out looks just like a peanut butter cups and they spin chocolate layers yeah that's alright I'm going to show you guys how to do this alright now with regards to doing this recipe it's really good because you have full control over how much sugar you want to use you can use just a little bit or a lot of the powdered sugar because we're going to use all-natural peanut butter and so this is great for people who are diabetic now if you can't use sugar what you can do is increase the tapioca search that we use and in a honey or maple syrup or I got I got syrup as your sweetener and yeah you can eliminate sugar as well that's because we're adding in our salt if you're on a salt reduced diet you can either eliminate it altogether or as little or as much as you like so this is really good for anybody who is restricted with diet as well as if you're a diabetic you can use the dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate use dark chocolate alright guys so let's jump into those ingredients of what we need to get started let's make some chocolate that material D car being in a smaller mason jar at two forty four forty minutes and then I've just got my shortening I've used one cup of shortening mine's yellow because I've used the butter flavor so I'm gonna be using the my shortening in place of butter for a lot of things so I decided to go with the butter flavor and a pot of water now you need the pot large enough deep enough but it is going to be able to cover your oil or your shortening once it's melted with the herb in it it's very important that your oil is always covered by water so I'm just gonna place this in here into the water and I'm gonna let that melt up just gonna boil that up and let that melt down while my herb is d carving and then we gotta cool it cool the deeds cool our herb yeah you can always use a French press instead of a mason jar it's nice because it already has the built in the screen for for helping when you have to now you can also use a French press for this I usually use the French press however I thought more people have a mason jar so I just go the mason jar method today alright so I have just added my plant material to my shortening and I've just given it a mix up there and they still mix up I'm gonna place there in the water and like I said the one thing is very important is that your water is above your shortening line you never want it to go below and the reason is is if you do your shortening is going to get hotter than what we want it to but keeping the water on the outside and completely surrounded maintains a constant temperature for what's inside if you allow that to go below your shortening will actually heat up a lot a lot higher and look and can burn your plant material which we don't want so I said I'm gonna let that go for two hours every once in a while I'm gonna come by and give her a shake up and if you're wondering I was using shake that's why I don't have any larger pieces in there and that's it and we're just gonna let I said go for two hours okay so you just want to have it on the mild simmer like that just where there's little tiny bubbles on the bottom of the pot but it is not boiling or vigorously boiling so what I said keep that temperature down a little bit patient is done put in and make sure that you strain it really well with a fine fine mesh strainer a cheesecloth or you can get one of these hold on you can get one of these bags from magical butter and it has the superfine it catches all the really fine sediment far as I said cheesecloth and that will work as well you put it into your stand mixer or if you're gonna use a hand mixer you're gonna be standing there for about 20 minutes we're gonna set this to low and we're gonna let this go for about 20 minutes as I said now if you used regular shortening yours is gonna be a lot lighter a very light light green and because I used the butter one is very yellow so mines it's gonna probably be darker than yours if you didn't use the butter but yeah just pour it into a container it will solidify and you can use it just like butter in most of your recipes all right so for our peanut butter cups what we're gonna need is about a hundred and fifty grams we're gonna make six large ones so we're gonna need about 150 grams of Hershey's chocolate if you want them to taste as close to the Rees peanut butter cup you want to use the Hershey's chocolate if you don't really care that much any milk chocolate will work and essentially what about 150 grams and for candidates about three of the small bars probably I think in the States it's like two or you can just use one large one in and around oh we got chocolate in my peanut butter oh all right we are going to need 1/2 a cup of peanut butter - the bar wrapper you're going to want an additional about quarter cup to a half cup we are going to want 1 cup of powdered or icing sugar a tablespoon of either can of butter or can of shortening now the shortening is going to give you a more solid product especially at room temperature because butter melts at a lower room temperature that'll be a little bit softer at room if you use the shortening they're going to stay firmer you're going to want a tablespoon of tapioca starch 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of milk doesn't matter what kind of milk and that's for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate bars you're gonna want either if you do not want to temper your chocolate then use the chocolate candy melts they taste great they work amazing they're pretty much idiot-proof if you do want to use real chocolate and you're experienced and you know how to temper go right ahead I've done tempering a few times I hate tempering so I'm going with the candy melts and you absolutely want to use the can of shortening not butter and as I said because you're shortening has a melting point of 95 to 115 so you are chocolates are going to stay set at room temperature that's all we need for the chocolate side so let's jump into our equipment and what we need and then we'll get this some of this stuff made up here all right so what we're going to need for our peanut butter cups are some cupcake liners either medium or large I've got the large here a cupcake pan to put these into to warm up gonna need pair of scissors and spatulas a bowl offset spatula and a spoon and your mixer with the blades for our for the peanut butter cup as well if you've got one of these is as a candy dispenser a chocolate dispenser these are great especially because we want to get these same amount and we want to do it quickly and easily now here's a little trick for you to create a whip when they normally come they don't have they're like this and you have to push them they're not automatic but you can create an automatic trigger by taking elastic just make a slip through it and then just put it across the bottom like so and now you've got an autumn trigger in that smart all right so that's it for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate we just need our mold pretty much now what you read I really do recommend getting the polycarbonate molds because they work so much you come out with a really professional-looking chocolate I don't recommend the silicone ones because one it's difficult to get your chocolate bars out of you have to peel them out quite often they break as well as you don't get quite the same shine as you do from the public cabinets or the plastic molds work really well as well so I think that's about it usually me you know I forget something I'll throw in there later but I think I've got the major stuff covered so let's jump into our making our peanut butter cups first alright so the very first thing we're gonna do is we got to cut our cups down to size so the easiest way to do this I'm gonna do six so I've got six of my liners here is fold them in half like so and then you want to cut about a half an inch or an inch off an inch off and you're just gonna go try and go evenly all the way around see now we have cups that are roughly the same size the weight side I just put them and get your tins and then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to get our chocolate our Hershey chocolate melted or your clean milk chocolate we're gonna get that melted now you can either my you can either melt it in the microwave I do mine at 30 second interval first then 20 then 15 then I finish it out at 10-second intervals until it is completely melted you can do it over a double boiler so any pot or a proper double boiler you can use or one of those candy melting pots any of those methods will work so it will work it just perfectly fine whoops I'm just gonna set that aside and if you want to if you've got if you are using the can of shortening you can add about a teaspoon or so a can of shortening to your chocolate if you'd like to but I'm just gonna get that melted up and then won't get everything put together alright so I've got my chocolate melted here it's all nice and smooth and like so so now you want to take a little bit about a teaspoon or so let's see you just drop it into the bottom we're gonna move it around now this is a little difficult to work with I find it's easier to take them out you can use the back of the spoon to go around the bottom and you want to bring it up around your edges and remember you just want to keep it a thin coat then you want to try and get as close to that top there as you can you just dip the back of the spoon in if you need a little bit more like so so I've got all the sides relatively evenly covered here drop it back into the mall and into the cake pile or the cupcake pan smack that down now if your bottom is not all filled just take a little bit more and just just lightly enough so that you just have that little light coating on the bottom so these are a bit of a pain to get doing even I'm just gonna do that again to all of them I find the offset works a lot better I'm just gonna finish the rest of these out and then we will get the peanut butter part going if you find this a little too much in the bottom you can just drop the excess all right so now that I got all the chocolate into my cups here just gonna clean off the top and then we're gonna set these aside let them set up while we make up our peanut butter filling all right so for peanut butter filling we're going to put in our half a cup of our all-natural peanut butter we are going to put in our our can of shortening but we do we want it melted and the reason that we want it melted is because if it's all if it's at room temperature and it's more than solid it may not evenly distribute all through your peanut butter it'll be little you can end up with little clumps of it so you definitely want to make sure to melt it get that in there and we are going to our to our Center we are going to add our powdered sugar our tapioca and our salt and we're going to sift that through and any hard chunks that don't go through just to start those and now we're going to need our mixer first of all so we don't end up with flying powder everywhere you just want to fold that in to your peanut butter and your can of shortening or your butter and we're going to add in our teaspoon of milk and we're just going to start our mixer on low now what will happen is it is all going to clump up like this it's gonna clump up like like this it's gonna kind of look like rinoa that's okay don't worry that's what we have the extra peanut butter for this is what we want it to do to start with so just continue to mix it until it's all broken down into little chunks like this and now we're gonna take our peanut butter with our mix and we're just going to drizzle something a little at a time until it starts to come together and form a nice mixture looks like I'm gonna need this might need a little bit more than that half cup we'll see actually I think I just used a quarter cup they're a little bit more big spoonful here just a little bit so the texture that we're looking for basically is like a peanut butter dough so we don't want it super stiff but we also don't want it really really some loose so we do want it basically like a dough like this so I do want it a little bit looser because that's a little too firm but that's the best is what we're working towards so I'm just gonna scoot it a little bit more peanut butter now so now if you've got it like this it's coming together so now we're just gonna knead it a little bit so I said it should be like dough you're just gonna need this up a little bit and then I'm just gonna take pieces of it and I'm just gonna kind of roll it trying to get it roll it into a rope here about the size of the bottom of my cup the diameter of my cups and then you're going to cut about quarter inch discs I only need sex we got a lot of dough here then we're going to take two of them and stock them together like so now if you used butter yours are going to be a little bit looser if you use the shortening they're going to be a lot firmer and that's because there's no water in shortening there is they go two to three percent of water in butter so we got those gonna get my cuffs well then we're gonna take two of those disks and squish them down your mold and then you can take your tray and you're gonna work them so you just want to make sure to fill in your cup until it's almost right to the top of the where your chocolate is cuz you know on the Reese cups it's a very very thin layer of chocolate over your top so you want the build up to almost the top you just want to leave just like a little millimeter or so of space for your chocolate topping and you want to try and make sure that's even as possible I said mine's a little bit stiffer yours if you use the butter will be smoother and they will flatten out nicely and evenly into your molds when you smack them down like so and for your extra peanut butter if you've got it you can just store it in a in any kind of airtight container and use at or at a later date trying to pop those into the fridge for about half hour now here is a peanut butter one the center that I made up earlier this I used with cannabutter so you can see it's a lot looser and more workable it's not as stiff as the one with the shortening and so this one as I said when you put it in to your mole into them into the complet cup and you smack them down they just spread out really nice so now for our chocolate bars what I've done is I added my my shortening I melted my shortening and I added it on into my chocolate and you're just gonna mix that around with it kind of all coated and we're gonna you're gonna about your chocolate in your preferred method alright so you've got your melted chocolate now it's really important to stir it well not vigorously because we don't want to create a ton of air bubbles but we want to make sure that it is well well stirred so that our shortening is properly incorporated into the chocolate and you'll know that by there will be no streaks it's going to be one uniform color and texture you won't see any kind of streaking now I've lined up just put a piece of parchment paper down so it can catch any of the excess that we scrape off so that none goes to waste and if you don't thoroughly stir it like so to make sure that the shortening is properly and well incorporated is you'll end up with streaks in your chocolate you don't want that you want to have that really pretty solid look to it okay once you're happy with your chocolate before we put it into the mold we're gonna top it out a little bit to get out some of those air bubbles so you're gonna shake it agitate it and there we go and they're just going to pour it into our molds now when you're pouring your molds again you want to do it nice and evenly fairly quickly and evenly so that you get that nice smooth if you do it in kind of sections pour a little bit shake it out you'll end up with different layer looks to it you don't want to have that basically oh look at that I calculated that pretty good and then you want to get a spatula spatula like that and you're gonna go hold it straight to the top OOP and just go straight along this will pull off your excess [Applause] off your edges I was gonna give this a final little shake and tap down any excess get out any of the excess uh uh access air bubbles want to make sure those sides are clean so you take out a nice even nice clean chocolate and once you're happy with your mold it's gonna go into the fridge for 20 for a minimum of 20 minute it needs that time to crystalline to crystalline crystallize something like that it's a technical term in chocolate to let it come back together so it needs at least I said 20 minutes in the fridge do not put it in the freezer to speed this up it needs to be the fridge so while our chocolate bars are setting we can put the tops on to our peanut butter cups so I just remounted my chocolate my the remainder of my Hershey's chocolate here and we are going to just add a little bit to the top and just smooth it out easier key spoon camera we just want a nice thin coating just seal up that top smack her down so you're just gonna smack them down until the tops are nice and even and then you're gonna pop these back into the fridge for 20 minutes to let that talk chocolates set and then we are gonna take everything out and see how everything looks all right so the chocolate bars are set now if you don't want to get fingerprints on your nice pretty chocolate you want to use latex or rubber gloves so you take them out of the refrigerator well let them sit for just about 30 seconds a minute and then we're gonna give them a good smoke whoops one broke not too hard and you need to flip them over and there we go beautiful chocolate bars and I'll show you once they get to room temperature that they will actually stay set it won't bring out the peanut butter cups and check those puppies out now here's one thing I want to show you you might see on some of the chocolate here there's some slight imperfections it's not completely smooth and clear it's nice and smooth and shiny that was because there was some my mold was not a hundred percent clean I thought it was your molds have to be really a hundred percent clean with hot soapy water and completely dry otherwise that will happen to your chocolate so well let's have a look at our peanut butter cups and we'll wrap this the puppy up oh sorry and then for your just for your chocolate or to keep them you want to use a thin some thin tin foil and just wrap them up like a little Christmas present I'm not very good at wrapping presents but there you got it and then you can always make your own wrappers just from you can print out on paper you can make your own paper wrappers for them all right so I got my peanut butter cup set now if there's any chocolate kind of stuck to the to your cupcake liner and the tin you just want to scrape that make sure that's loose and then you should be able to just take up there we got our peanut butter cups so let's have a look at one of these suckers there we go so what I do to avoid is for the edges what I would recommend them to do two rounds of coating the edges and that will help take care of that issue there and then have a look inside of them so you can see if you've made these before you would just open them up they would have squished all out and check out those insides looks just like a peanut butter cup isn't that cool and these taste so good with so much reduced sugar to all those other recipes out there and in a way that you can actually make them vegan or let's see vegan yeah if you use the vegetable shortening and you use the tapioca starch with the you can use powdered sugar I think that's not an issue but if you don't want to use powdered sugar you can increase the tapioca a little bit and use honey or maple syrup or a guard at not a car I got I got syrup one of those replacement syrups you can use that as a sweetener and avoid the sugar all together you just has a sin to have to increase that tapioca somewhat you just kind of have to work to get till you get to that text that consistency texture but other than that that's why demonstration there for you today if you have any questions at all as always please don't hesitate to ask and I gotta get this stuff off my fingers and and I

It's a peanut butter\npie that's no-bake with a peanut butter crust,\na peanut butter filling, tons of peanut butter cups\nand a chocolate topping. You're not going to want to to miss it. (light music) Hey everyone, it's Dorothy\nwith crazyforcrust.com and welcome back to my kitchen. Today I'm showing you\none of my favorite pies. It's a no-bake peanut butter\npie full of my favorite candy, peanut butter cups. This pie has two cups of chopped\npeanut butter cups in it. If you love chocolate and peanut butter, this is going to be the pie\nthat you request all year long. For more delicious\ndesserts and easy recipes be sure to subscribe to my channel. Now let's get in the kitchen. Making this pie couldn't be easier. We're going to start with the crust. Now you have a few different options when you make a no-bake crust. You could always buy one at the store. I'm totally not going\nto judge you for that. But if you want to make a\nhomemade one and make this a fully peanut butter\npie, use Nutter Butters. That's what I used for\nthis pie crust today. So it's a fully peanut butter pie, but this would also be\namazing with Oreo cookies or even peanut butter Oreos. And if you, I think Nutter\nButters are more of a U.S. thing, so if you're outside the United\nStates and you can't find Nutter Butters, it's just a\npeanut butter sandwich cookie. So whatever you decide\nto use for your crust, we're going to make it\nby crumbling the cookies in a food processor. And no, I do not remove the filling. So just add about 20 to 25\ncookies to your food processor and process until they're fine. You may need to pulse it a\nfew times just to make sure any big chunks get broken up. And then go ahead and add the crumbs to five tablespoons of melted butter. I'm using unsalted butter\nbut you could use salted if that's what you have. And then stir it together with a fork. I like using a fork to\nstir my crust together so it doesn't get really compacted. It stays nice and sandy. And once that butter is\ncompletely incorporated, you're going to press\nit into an up the sides of a nine-inch pie plate. This would also be fine\nwith like a nine and a half to a 10 inch pipe plate, but\ndon't go much bigger than that or there won't be enough filling, Just go ahead and press it in, compact it. And then you're going to chill the crust while we make the filling. The filling for this\npie is all peanut butter and the peanut butter cups. So we're going to start with\neight ounces of cream cheese, and you're going to add a\nquarter of a cup of granulated sugar for sweetness and a third of a cup of creamy peanut butter. I'm just using a Skippy\nnatural peanut butter. You could also use crunchy. You could use any sort of\npeanut butter that you like. I don't recommend using a homemade one. It's best to use one\nof the commercial ones you don't have to stir,\nbut I do use the Skippy or Jiffy naturals if you like that. But go ahead and use a hand\nmixer to mix that together until it's nice and\nsmooth, and then add in one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix it until it's smooth,\nit'll be nice and thick. Now I love using Cool\nWhip in my no-bake pies because it's super simple,\neasy, no extra work for me. Plus it holds up better I\nfind in the refrigerator, but if you want to use\nfresh whipped cream, then you're going to whip about probably one and a half cups of\ncold, heavy whipping cream to get about three cups or\nso of fresh whipped cream. But I'm just going to use\nan eight-ounce container of cool whip. You can use any kind of\nCool Whip, extra creamy, fat free, sugar, free, whatever you want. And go ahead and stir that and we're going to fold it in carefully. Don't use your mixer just\nfold it in, it'll seem like it's not going to mix together\nwith the peanut butter mixture because it's so thick, but\nit will just keep folding and be careful not to\nstir it too fast or hard. You don't want to like,\nbreak the whipped part of the Cool Whip. So we have all that together. Then we're going to deal\nwith our peanut butter cups. Now you could use regular size. You could buy the ones that,\nthose little mini ones that come unwrapped, I'm just\nusing the miniatures. I unwrapped them, I'm\nusing a few big handfuls. I just measured out two\ncups of them already wrapped and that's what I'm unwrapping. If they start to peel sometimes\nif your house is warm, the chocolate will peel\noff the peanut butter. So if that's happening, just\npop them in their refrigerator for a couple minutes so\nthey can kind of harden up. They'll unwrap weight easier that way. Once you have them all and wrapped go ahead and chop them up. You want small chunks,\nnot too big, not too fine. And then you're going to do\nabout one and a half cups or so into the mixture of the\npeanut butter mixture. You're not going to use all of\nit, save some for the topping but go ahead and just\nstir about three quarters of the chopped peanut butter\ncups into your pie filling. Now it's time to assemble our pie. So go ahead and put the pie\nfilling into the pie crust and spread it out evenly. All right, now that we\nhave our pie assembled it's time to top it. Now you can totally just stop here, top it with the crumbled\npeanut butter cups. Maybe even add some extra whipped cream but I'm going to go one step\nfurther and I'm going to add a jar of hot fudge sauce. And so I'm just using like a\nSmucker's hot fudge right here and I'm going to put the\nwhole jar on top of this pie and spread it all around\nuntil it's nice and smooth. And then I'm going to\nchill that until it's set, just a couple of hours and\nthen sprinkle it with the rest of the crumbled peanut butter cups. This pie is a peanut butter lover's dream. And there we have it,\npeanut butter cup pie. This thing is peanut butter to the max. Remember it's a peanut butter crust, a peanut butter filling,\npeanut butter cups and a chocolate top. I am so excited to cut a slice of this. Alright, let's have a\nlittle taste of our pie. It is so peanut buttery,\nthat filling is just super peanut buttery and\nthe peanut butter cups and the crust is nice and crunchy it adds that extra hint\nof peanut butter flavor. Again, I think this\nwould also be fantastic with an Oreo crust. Oh, this is, if you love\npeanut butter and chocolate, this is the pie for you, I\nknow you're going to love it. Leave me a comment and\nlet me know how much you love peanut butter, I'm\ngoing to go enjoy this pie while you keep watching. (light music)", "Il4EqbDF9Rc": "what's up everybody it's fun size review time with my bite size human hi i'm a fun size human hi it's peanut butter lemon levels yeah a little late but you nailed it dude as my eloquent little buddy just told you guys ultimate peanut butter lovers bless you reese's cups these are all peanut butter all the time i know what you're saying i said it to myself when i saw these what the heck is a reese's peanut butter cup without chocolate am i right good talk what is reese's cup without chocolate well it's an ultimate peanut butter lovers cup so we got peanut butter on the outside peanut butter on the inside zero percent chocolate in these you all have your own packages so we don't have to have any fights today big shout out to reese's for sending these over are you ready to try yeah brooklyn's ready to try them cam are you ready to try them i'm gonna take that as a yes because we don't have all day let's i don't need to be negative nancy but i'm a purist when it comes to reese's peanut butter cups to me it's not really a reese's peanut butter cup without chocolate but i'm going with open mind see how this goes as we've already established i am a reese's purist i don't think reese's peanut butter cups are reese's peanut butter cups without chocolate i know shocking but i love peanut butter like everybody else in this house i love peanut butter and these have a lot of peanut butter right there's no real balance here it's all peanut butter it's a lot of peanut butter flavor that's a little peanut butter and that is certainly not a bad thing sure there was no contrast between the chocolate peanut butter you'd have a regular reese's peanut butter cup but nevertheless these are delicious and i am pleasantly surprised the kids

these next month next month being april thumbs down thumbs up definitely a thumbs up on these peanut butter almost always gets a thumbs up from us peace out", "3RIiCvjUD7o": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel in today's video we're whipping up something and spectacular if you're anything like me this holiday season you're probably busting buttons what I mean by that is example example like the other day I was putting on my pants pulled him up bud popped off two windows got locked up my girlfriend get hit in the eye she can't see out of it anymore we're not even in a relationship it put a big strain on it what I'm trying to say is that recipes like this the healthy ones are what keep you on track this holiday season and keep you from dipping into those things that are gonna really just pack that weight on unhealthy versions that aren't any good for you nor me with all that being said today we are making epic Reese's peanut butter cups but the healthy way with some added protein keeping fat low and keeping sugar low so if you guys are ready to see if this epic recipe is all it's cracked up to be then as always I'm here to chef for you let's do [Music] and one of the reasons I wanted to make this recipe was because one it seems super easy required almost no ingredients ensue I didn't need to use my oven which is currently on the fritz if anybody knows of a cheap oven to buy let me know in the comment section below minimum is like $2,000 and boy rjf need to sell a few more meal plans before we make that investment so anyways looking at the ingredients here super easy you're only gonna need a protein powder which I'm using chocolate peanut butter pie it seems fitting for this recipe from pure bollocks baby rewboss.com could rjf 10 is gonna save you some hard-earned cash and then we also need some chocolate now I'm going for semi-sweet chocolate chips little less sugar still gonna give us that chocolate flavor we are gonna be melting these so you don't need to buy the chips you can also buy a bar or whatever you want to do gonna need yourself some unsweetened almond milk just a tad bit though so you guys already know I love this stuff right here silk brand gonna need yourself some peanut butter obviously for peanut butter cups we got jiff natural I just loved the texture consistency of this stuff probably my favorite peanut butter right now then yourself a little bit of coconut oil it's how we little bit and then we also got ourselves some stevia here we also just need a little bit of this as well you can use liquid or the powdered version I'm gonna be even powder so that's it guys this alone is gonna create an epic masterpiece worth writing home about worth fighting for worth calling your great-grandma Meredith over whatever you want to use there guys I'm just telling you this gonna be magical let's go ahead and get this started so we will be using a food scale to make this as macro accurate as possible and plus dudes can help us get all the right quantities from our ingredients here so I recommend a food scale if you need a good food scale link in description nothing like $12 so the same one I got Singh works wonders let me tell you so first off we're gonna start off with a hundred and twenty grams of protein that is gonna equal out to about four scoops but like I said I like to be super accurate with these guys that way we know exactly what we're putting in our body so we'll go ahead and do one there two three and that is 120 grams of protein looks like lid back on you slide your back and then in this place we're gonna take the ball mmm I know what you're thinking Ram what are you doing here this is getting wacky but just trust me guys I'm telling you game-changer good put our peanut butter on the scale remove the lid required way more turns than I thought it was going to peel the top off reveling the smell worth it now what we got to do we're gonna hit the tare but it's gonna burn our scale back to zero and we're gonna weigh out 80 grams of peanut butter I like doing it this way I think it's easier than just adding it in here being over I'm gonna stick your fingers and pull it out just this is just the easier method guys truck I'm gonna have to use a clear plastic spoon because Remington didn't do dishes go figure we're gonna go down in here pull out about 80 grams yeah yank that off - 32 C hold on see if we can do here that is minus 64 get a big ol heaping helping and that is 76 - 80 per fect - boom boom go ahead and add this right in ploy the use of some finger magic here to make sure we get all of it and that is perfect and then what we're gonna add to this is 1/3 a cup of unsweetened almond milk or can't find my third cup measuring cup so we'll just use a cup use our eyeballs here so glad we got those to use looks like a third to me we're gonna dump that right in there watch that sweet nectar drizzle on top there we go and now we're gonna go back into our clear spoon ways to get down here and now there's not a specific measurement for stevia that we need but it's gonna add a little bit of sweetness to it I'm just gonna do how about two spoons of it I think that'll probably be a good ratio there and there we go two spoons of stevia right in there now the next part is pretty easy we're just gonna go in here and mix this all up my require a little bit of stirring if you have something going in a plastic spoon and you actually do your dishes unlike us here at rjf might be a little easier I'm being super careful not to break this plastic spoon cuz I could have just pulled on out and rinsed it but oh well oh it's all starting to come together see it chunking up in there gotta love a little chunk action mom oh I say guy appreciate that chunk action the dog barking outside your shop and we are good here you shot ah that was what I was worried about people that's what I was worried about so if you look at this here we're gonna use it like a little spoon a child spoon okay check out the consistency here it's pretty um creamy dangly not sure what the right word is but you can see it right there on what we're looking for that is about perfect I did have to a tiny tiny tiny little bit more almond milk so don't go overboard with it but if you notice that he's still a little dry looking at just a tiny bit more if you start it up so this is about perfect let's go ahead and set our base now for this next part it's gonna require a little bit of splainin so what I'm gonna tell you first and foremost is in order to get these to look like greasy cups you need to get yourself a little foil baking cup came here I bought them in a pack that looked just like this oiled baking cups Reynolds Kitchen Donohue Reynolds is but he's a pretty cool cat in my book he got 32 cups here like a dollar 50 so that's what's gonna give us that shape technically you don't got to do the shape but um you know froth anticipable at we're gonna go ahead and take a little muffin sheet here and we put those baking things down in here as you can probably see by my display we're gonna take some olive oil Pam we're gonna go ahead and spray these that way these don't stick to them now this may look like we're gonna bake them but we are not this is gonna be simply like a placeholder maybe spout fat fastfat there we go reminds me back when I had hair baby just hit it light and easy a click Dustin get the ladies of thrust in if you know what I'm saying the funny part is I washed a spoon now I can't find it all right back with a metal spoon ladies and gentlemen so at this point the video we're gonna go ahead and sink our a little peanut butter mixture here we're gonna place it down in these cups now I'm not really sure how many cups this rescue is supposed to make I'm gonna try to fit it into six so we'll place this down in here there we go very sticky oh and then we're gonna go through and press these down into these cups gosh is wasted here than I expected we've got ourselves into a sticky situation that wasn't funny all right back down okay now maybe spray your fingers with that nonstick spray because this is a little tougher than I thought but we're gonna push through it no such thing is an impossible problem only in a possible mindset about said problem alright bingo looks a lot like that so let me go ahead and lift this out and show you we're gonna take them all and place our base layer down in there like that and like I said you can go down and just kind of press on it get it all pushed down perfect I'm gonna go through and do that to each and every one of these and I will be right back and the hard part is officially done we got our base in these cups we kind of had to stuff this last one full here but Hannah just be an extra large one for the big boy so go ahead and move this off and now the easy part we're gonna make our little chocolates so we need our chocolate chips we need our coconut oil and we need a food scale there we go first thing we're gonna do is weigh out sixty grams of our chocolate chips once again weighing everything out to make sure we're as accurate as possible alright see that was eighty two so we'll put a few back in sixty rotten dot and I told you guys we just need a wee little bit of coconut oil so just need to add about five grams in here someone take my spoon put that right yeah that was five grams on the money perfect now what we're gonna do with this is I'm gonna take it and place it in the microwave for about thirty seconds and I'm gonna keep checking it I don't want to burn it but I want it to Mel and I'm gonna stir it up so there's keep kind of doing 30-second intervals watching it maybe jumping down to like ten seconds kind of going back and forth till this is fully melted so I'm gonna do just that I will be right back and after a little bit of time in the microwave we ourselves our leaf with chocolate perfectly Mel did not burn and good to go so now he's got to take this and kind of put it on top of all these cups and we're practically done guys we're almost there so now what we're gonna do is find our cups and we're gonna go in and place a thin little layer on top not too much but enough to give it that peanut butter cup like look boom so that one's good and we're going here we'll spread it out perfect right on top there and now I'm gonna go through them I do that to all of these and I will check back in with you guys when we're done and we got all of our chocolate right in here on top now if you want more chocolate you can add more just keep in mind it's not the best move to make if macros are of your primary concern it might not seem like all that chocolate to work for these and as long as you scrape and spread it out you are good to go so at this point we're here to put them in the fridge until they set or if you want to do it quickly and you're like me just go ahead and put them in the freezer so I want to place them in the freezer probably gonna take like 20 to 30 minutes let these guys sit we're gonna pull them out take a look out and taste test them and all that good stuff guys so stay tuned it's about to get real and after 30 minutes in the freezer these are good to go trying to give you a good look here it's a little hard to see they definitely aren't picture perfect but I'm feeling they are gonna taste really good let's pick one of these up and just get a better look at it check it out hmm we got ourselves our little bass there with the protein the got ourselves our chocolate layer on top not too much but just enough I don't watch you guys but I think the wait is over it's time to give these a try do you think they're gonna be double seal approved or not think they're gonna be any good comment below right now no matter what just scroll down on your way down hit that thumbs up button comment let me know if you think they're gonna be good or not and I want to give you guys an honest flavor review let's do it okay guys moment of truth this is what we've been waiting for let's go ahead and grab one of these bad boys and see what they're all about what do you guys think did you comment below if not do it real quick things are about to get serious um three to one that gets the drumroll please single seal of approval not quite the best thing I've ever had but in a pinch with those macros keeping that sugar pretty low for what it is it's actually a really good recipe and honestly I'd probably rather eat this over at regular Reese's Cup definitely a win for this recipe so first time I've ever made these so obviously if you do it you might be able to improve upon me and make it look a little prettier but it's actually really good I would take another bite right now that's so much peanut butter that makes it hard to talk to you guys so from a macro standpoint and keep in mind this is one out of six you could have made this into nine twelve make them smaller if you wanted to but out of six this is the macros you get for one of them you have eleven point five grams of fat we have 29 grams of protein and twelve grams of carbohydrates equaling a calorie total of 268 calories that might seem like a lot and I would say for one peanut butter cup it is but you I think about you're getting natural peanut butter in there you're getting 30 grams of protein with only 12 grams of carbs so it's really not bad for all my low-carb dieters out there great little option here you're not getting the regular version and getting all that sugar spiking your insulin causing those buttons to bust oh man this has been a crazy video you guys get what I'm saying so thank you all so very very very much that's guys for a favor right now like I said my ex-girlfriend I'm trying to get her back and you guys to comment below and say get well soon she's only seeing out of one eye right now and I'm hoping we can get that fixed too because I'm off to ditch her anyways you know what I mean

here this Betty we're meetin James production I'll see you fine ladies and gentlemen at the next video see you guys", "oIiwkMnYy3o": "what's up guys this is derek alligator with dhf dns comm and today we're going to make some frozen peanut butter cups this is probably the quickest recipe that i know how to make it's high in protein low in fat low in carbs just a couple notes about this recipe one you want to make sure you use pasteurized egg whites because you can eat or drink those without cooking them and to make sure you use a good tasting protein as always if the protein doesn't taste good the recipe is not going to taste good so as you can see i'm using a blender bottle any protein shaker will work if you don't have a protein shaker you can mix it in a bowl alright now first off you're going to want to put your liquid egg whites in like I said make sure they're pasteurized 3 tablespoons is one serving which would equal 1 large egg white so we're going to go ahead and put 6 large egg whites in and if you're using a scale like me we put around 275 grams in next up we're going to put a tablespoon of baking cocoa in now we're going to go ahead and put 40 grams of protein powder in just make sure to use a good-tasting protein powder as you can see I'm using chocolate you can use any flavor with this recipe that you want as long as the protein powder tastes good next up two tablespoons of peanut butter yes my hands are clean as you can see for this recipe I'm using dark chocolate dreams by peanut butter and company just mix and match white chocolate wonderful buy them would go great with vanilla now we're just going to put one packet of stevia in if you have Splenda whatever sweetener you use is fine and that's it now you're just going to blend or mix all the ingredients together depending on your method got these silicone muffin cups I think at Bed Bath & Beyond great investment I think there were only like 10 bucks for 12 of them you can cook with them you can use them over and over and over and they work especially great for this recipe I would recommend putting these on a cookie sheet it makes taking them in and out of the freezer a lot easier so now you're just going to take the mixed ingredients and pour them in your cups now that you have them all poured out evenly you're just going to put them in the freezer for about two hours now that you've let them sit in the freezer for about two hours they should be ready and as you can see they are ready the nice thing about this is the silicone you can reuse it it's easy to wash and they don't stick as they would if you use paper now that you've taken them all out of the cups you put them in a container put it back in your freezer so they don't melt alright guys I just want to say thank you for watching if you liked the video please subscribe there should be a link right there or you can watch my last recipe video right there as always guys stay healthy", "wrEXq_0R5f8":

"0WCarcyHJnE": "hey there today i'm going to be doing a ketone test for you guys this is a pretty highly requested product so i'm excited to bring you guys this ketone test so i'm going to go ahead and test my ketones first and see where i'm at so it has been two hours since i had anything to eat i had some eggs point two so i'm gonna do what i like to call a reverse ketone test and i'm going to try a product and see if it increases my ketones obviously if it lowers my ketones then i'm not going to have a great gauge of how much it lowers my ketones but if it increases my ketones then um i mean it doesn't matter what level of ketones you're going to be at that's a that's a pretty good effect so so i am going to try the quest peanut butter cups the nutrition is for two cups it's 190 calories 15 grams of fat 13 total carbs four dietary fiber eight erythritol so that means it's one net carbs for two of the cups so it's half a carb per cup and 11 grams of protein so the ingredients are way so the ingredients are whey protein isolate erythritol unsweetened chocolate cacao butter peanuts palm kernel oil soluble corn fiber sodium caseinate contains two percent or less of the following sunflower lecithin sea salt butter fat natural flavor peanut oil and sucrose 15 grams of fat i like that oh well isn't this cute they put it in little cups like the reese's cups they i mean they are deceivingly like reese's cups wow these kind of look like they melted at some point so the chocolate is definitely harder than reese's cups and so is the peanut butter it's kind of a chalky if you've had the slim fast fat bombs it's kind of like that where it's just chalky i'll show you um it has a hint of like that reese's cup taste but there's also a hint of i don't know if it's like the whey protein but there's a hint of something that just makes you feel like that's not right that's not a reese's cup this will not pass as a reese's cup to anyone who has had a reese's cup it kind of reminds you of a reese's cup but you can tell you're not having a reese's cup um the chocolate isn't a very prominent chocolate it doesn't even really taste all that much like milk chocolate definitely not a dark chocolate so it's not bitter the cups aren't overly sweet there is definitely a sweetness aspect to it i think that more comes from the peanut butter but the chocolate isn't really sweet it's not really chocolatey and the chocolate's definitely not creamy i wouldn't say it's gritty it's more chalky um but i am going to have this other peanut butter cup and then i will test my ketones in an hour okay it has been one hour since i had those quest peanut butter cups i'm gonna test my ketones now okay i was at a point two last okay so it did go down a little bit i will test my ketones in another hour and see if they change at all okay it's been a total of two hours since i had those quest peanut butter cups so i'm gonna test my ketones now it was point one an hour ago so that's not bad it seems like um seems like uh the effect was pretty minimal um so i mean you guys can take what you will from that but a 0.1 decrease over a two-hour span pretty small anyways guys that is all i have for you in this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you have any suggestions of any products you want me to test in the future please let me know in the comment section below i really appreciate your feedback and i will see you guys in the next video bye [Music] [Music] you", "BzDWENe8ga8": "today how do not really trying some lilies no sugar added peanut butter cups I have the milk chocolate style add the dark chocolate peanut butter cup these were 250 each at Whole Foods so two dollars fifty cents it's actually quite a bit more than you would pay for a typical KT bar look 250 obese yes like painted stood in their heart these its stevia swings forty percent cocoa yeah two pieces are 160 calories another make this stuff for people they can't have sugar I think if I had to pay 250 or not no or not you sure I think I would eat sugar it would be too expensive TOEFL yeah yeah so we're trying it for the video will never buy it again even if we love it because it's so expensive it is Lily's calm it's certified gluten free it says move over sugar we'll take it from here we decided our chocolate was too good to let added sugar get in the way and so we created a whole line of unbelievable treats botanically sweetened with stevia and you know what happened life got sweeter welcome to the sweet life so these the Lily's is very popular it's like Reese's thin they're yelling they do look like the fans yeah these are not the regular thick caps every time I say this I think mother I think they ever doesn't say about me okay so these are they again give it these are these are on very young they they are fear not the worst thing I've ever eaten but not what some that Juanita I don't like it at all at all no let me that's one plant a little bite out not even a little I know that lilies is very very very popular with the quito crowd so because I might keep donating that crack because it has yeah I would just rather not have anything at all this is the dark chocolate it's a there's the dark shadow it might be better it might you can tell the difference with the milk there is when they say there is replaced with stevia and that's half sweetened there is no sweetness to this oh no it's not sweet it's very it's just like there's no depth to it it's just flat that's what I really didn't even taste the peanut butter yeah I really didn't even get the peanut butter really though yeah the first one I taste a little peanut butter it tastes like I got burnt peanut mm-hmm I like honestly not like the Darwin better not really did I think the dark one has a better flavor than the milk yeah it's almost all dark chocolate yes I don't I I get very very little peanut butter on that I wonder if it's cuz you expect it to be a little more bitter with the dark chocolate I have never ever sorry you expect to be a little sweeter nuts no it's not so in videos like yeah these same you want them I don't know how to new they are said yeah but milk it just has absolutely no sweetness at all and of course this is coming from two people who aren't on keto and so we're trying these it's just regular people who eat everything everything I'm gonna hold up and so we were just judging it on flavor or not going by how good it is for you know what fits into that that died we are judging it as far as flavor alone yeah how many I would not but even if I was on keto I think and that's just me because I haven't been on keto I guess I was without it for six months I may be really gone for something yeah but I would have to be done I would have to be desperate to in words about these to eat I would have to be very very very desperate and reached a point of desperation yeah because I think I'd rather eat other things because it's very it's very bill yeah it's just yeah it's just not good but we bought I bought a lot of lilies are they all the same premise they're all sugar-free I think they're all no sugar no sugar added yeah I'm not sure to free there's no sugar added but we'll say because I bought different forms at bottom and this was just these were the only two peanut butter cups the other ones are like chocolate couple nets and things like that so those may be good yeah you get the flavor in there better than mine yeah it'll be a totally different experience so we're not I'm not going to judge this little brand just my own things peanut butter cops trust me you know we'll go into that completely fresh and new and and judge it for what it is but as far as these items go I would pass on them so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "rCbJUSk-G-A": "hello I'm Simon Whistler you're watching the today I found our YouTube channel and in the video today the story of Reese's peanut butter cups a popular chocolate cup filled with delicious peanut butter Reese's peanut butter cups were created by a man named Harry Burnett HP Reese Reese was born on May the 24th 1879 in Pennsylvania to a farming family he married in 1900 and went on to have 16 children by 1903 not surprisingly he was struggling to support his growing family so he took on all manner of jobs from butcher to factory worker in 1917 Reese found an advertisement to work on a dairy farm owned by milton f Hershey owner of the Hershey Chocolate Company in Hershey Pennsylvania so didn't know it at the time taking the job would shape the rest of Reese's future he works on the farm for several years and later began working in the company's chocolate factory where he became inspired by Hershey and set out to make his own chocolates initially Reese considered his chocolate venture to be a means of providing a little extra money for his family he started creating confections in his basement naming bars and candies after as many children he used fresh ingredients for his candy creations along with a large quantity of Hershey's chocolate in the 1920s Reese's basement born enterprise was doing much better than expected with the candies selling successfully to the local market he decided to take the business even more seriously and set up CHP Reese candy company in 1928 Reese also started selling chocolate and peanut butter confections he simply called peanut butter cups or penny cups as they cost just one Benny each at the time they were so successful that Reese was able to sell five-pound boxes of the Cubs to local retailers for candy displays Reese was soon able to quit his job at the Hershey factory to concentrate on his own business he even built a 100,000 square foot Factory on chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania making a wide assortment of candies including raisin clusters and chocolate-covered dates however during World War two Reese was forced to abandon his other project due to a scarcity of supplies and economic hardship he chose to focus solely on his buttercups which were his most popular product and the investment well it paid off unfortunately as his cops were growing rapidly in popularity rese tide unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1956 just a few days before his 77th birthday seven years later six of Reese's sons that decided to sell the family business the Hershey's chocolate company verted inspired Ries purchased the HP Reese candy company for twenty three point five million dollars in 1963 with HP Reese's children getting roughly a five percent share in the Hershey Company which today is worth about twenty billion dollars five percent of which is a billion dollars and so it was that from their humble beginnings in the basement of a determined entrepreneurship looking for a way to support his enormous family that these peanut butter cups became one of the most popular confectionery in the world so I really hope you enjoyed

Today I am excited to teach you how to make\npeanut butter cups, from scratch. This is one of my favorite desserts to make\nand I am excited to share it with you. It is very simple, so with out further ado\nlet\u2019s get started. First clean your hands, because you are going\nto be touching the food quite a bit. Ok, the ingredients, half a cup of peanut\nbutter, or two of these. One tablesppon of butter softened, one third\ncup of powedered sugar, one forth teaspoon of salt, half a bag of chocolate chips, either\nmilk chocolate or semi-sweet, 2 candy bars, this can be whatever kind you want, I like\nmilk chocolate so I am going to use milk chocolate. Ok you grab a bowl, sugar, salt, peanut butter,\nbutter, and mix. Alright, it is all mixed. Good, put that aside. Turn on your oven. For this I am using a makeshift double boiler,\nyou don\u2019t want to put your chocolate in your pot by itself, you want to have some\nkind of way to melt it. You can put it in the microwave, but this\nworks really well too, so I have this little strainer that goes on top, water is in there,\nthis will go right on top just like that. Yeah, and its free, I had this stuff already;\nI didn\u2019t have to go spend money to go buy and actual melting thing. I am going to go ahead and take my chocolate\nchips, remember half a bag, I am going to put it one of these, one thing you want to\ndo is constantly stir the chocolate, so it doesn\u2019t burn. This is the other quarter cup of peanut butter. Mix that all together. Grab a cupcake holder, I put in these little\npaper cups, then what you are going to do is put in a little bit, a little bit on the\nbottom. Then shake it, so it looks like this. Then what you can do, is you are going to\ntake your peanut butter mixture, and you are going to take little bits of spoonfuls, and\nyou are going to smash it down and put it on the bottom here. Ok, so once you put the peanut butter mixture\non the bottom there, then you come back over here and grab your chocolate, and put it on\nthe top, about the same amount as you did on the bottom. Again you can as much as you want depending\non how thick you want to make these. Ok, after you are done putting chocolate on\nthe top here, then you just shake it like this, and that is how it looks like. Then you are ready to put it in the fridge,\nand there you go, that is all there is to it. Ok, so you will chill it in the fridge for\ntwenty to thirty minutes, until it hardens, it is pretty easy to tell when it is done,\nthen you enjoy. And that is all you do, pretty simple, pretty\neasy, and they taste awesome. Ok, so here we have the final product. I want you to notice something here, here\nis one that I made, and here is the classic peanut butter cup that you get from the store,\nnotice the difference? This one is a lot bigger. I am going to do a little taste test real\nquick. Here is mine, mmmm, here is the classic. The homemade ones in my opinion are bigger,\nand truly taste better I think, but maybe it is because I eat them more then the others,\nthe other ones are definitely good. Anytime you have chocolate and peanut butter\ntogether, golden. So now, let me give you a breakdown on the\napproximate time and cost that it takes to make these. Approximate time to make these, about fifteen\nto twenty minutes for the prep about 30 minutes in the fridge. Cost of the ingredients, 47 cents for the\npeanut butter, 7 cents for the butter, 10 cents for the powdered sugar, 1 cent for the\nsalt, 1 dollar for the chocolate chips, a 1.25 for the chocolate bar, I only used 1\nnot two, 28 cents for the paper cups, for a total of 3 dollars and 18 cents. That gives us a per cup cost of 18 cents. That is amazing. Sometimes you can find peanut butter cups\non sale, I found a pack of 8 for 1.25 at the store, that is 16 cents per cup, 2 cents cheaper\nthen mine, however mine are much bigger, and in mine opinion, taste much better. Normally, if you were to buy these at the\nstore, you are looking at a per cup cost between 35 cents and 40 cents a piece. So it is about double the cost of making them\nat home.

Today we're making a homemade version of Reese's peanut butter eggs. These are so simple. No baking, just a few\ningredients and beyond delicious. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen where I John Kanell teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These peanut butter eggs are gonna hop right into your mouth. So let's get started. First off, let's make that\npeanut butter filling. It is so easy and delicious. One cup of smooth peanut butter, and when you're using peanut butter, use one that is not the\nall natural separated out if you can, because those\nones will not mix as smoothly. You kind of want the regular\nprocessed peanut butters that have some palm oil\nand emulsifiers in them and they're gonna give you a\nreally nice smooth filling. When Brian and I were growing\nup in separate households, we would always have pretty\ncrazy Easter baskets. Our moms went all out. So for the boys we are\nmaking a full Easter basket that will include these\nchocolate peanut butter eggs. I'm so excited to see\ntheir faces light up. I will have to hide these\nwhere they can't find them. Okay, one cup in and now we're\ngonna add in five tablespoons of room temperature unsalted butter. Normally I would say like, \"Okay, you could use salted butter\" but in this recipe you're\ngonna want to have unsalted because that peanut\nbutter is salty (giggles). Plop that right in there,\nuse your paddle attachment, and we're gonna cream it up, pop it down and we're going to mix it up. Just cream it together.\n(mixer whirring) That's already delicious. One of my favorite snacks\nas a child was toast with butter and then peanut butter on top. That is the business. So right now we're gonna scrape\nthe bottom of the bowl down. Whenever you're making\na peanut butter filling, it is so easy, however, the\none thing that can mess you up is if you do not scrape the bowl down, you're gonna have like\na thinner, smoother, creamier layer on top with a\nthicker layer on the bottom and that's not what you want. So, scrape it down. If you have a peanut allergy by the way, you could totally do this\nwith almond butter as well or cashew butter, any nut\nbutter will work pretty well. Now it's time for the powdered sugar. This does two things, it sweetens it to make it delicious, but it also stiffens it up because this is pretty gloopy right now like you can see this is\nnot gonna be fun to roll, will not hold its shape either. So we're calling for two\ncups of powdered sugar, but if you want you can reduce that a bit or increase it a bit, it's\npartially to taste and to fill. We have two cups of sugar in there. Let's pop this down and mix. Carefully, don't explode. (mixer whirring) So you mix it a bit and you're like, \"Oh my gosh, this is a crumbling\nmess, what's going on?\" Well, scrape that bowl down,\neverything will be okay. See like, what is this, crumbles? No, no, no, we want a nice smooth mixture. But then you scrape down on the bottom, it's like pure peanut butter and butter. (upbeat music) Okay, we scraped that bowl down. I'm gonna add some vanilla and then see, \"Is two cups just right?\" Let's give it a try. (mixer whirring)\nTurn it on, add about a teaspoon. So just be patient and\nlet it come together. That powdered sugar is very deceptive. It's like, \"Nothing's happening, nothing's happening, it happened.\" So it'll happen, just keep mixing. (mixer whirring) Okay, a little bit of mixing later. If you see that your mixture\nis still a bit too crumbly, you can add in some water and it's kinda like making\npastry dough by the way, so here it's like, \"Oh, what are those, crumbles?\" But if you put it together, it will form something you can mold. This looks a tad bit dry, so I'm gonna add in just a bit of water. Various peanut butters will\nhave various levels of moisture so you can adjust accordingly. when it on low,\n(mixer whirring) then add in that water about\na tablespoon at a time. Note one tablespoon\nmade all the difference. (mixer whirring sharply) We gonna work it up to medium now just so it kinda comes together more really slapping that peanut butter around. (mixer whirring) And now here we go. This is perfect, it looks\nnice and smooth already and when you feel it in your hands, it's like silky play-dough. Perfect, okay, we're ready to mold. You'll wanna pinch off\nlittle bits of the dough. I'm actually measuring them and they're exactly 24\ngrams each, but that's me. You can do whatever you want. You can have big eggs, small eggs, they could all be different sizes or if you want them to be the same size, you can use a scale or really eyeball it. This is the size of like I don't know, a\nnice marble (murmurs). Anyways, roll it in your hands, roll, roll, roll. It should be forming like a nice kind of like smooth ball in your hands. If it's cracking a lot, it needs another drop or two of water, go ahead and mix it up, there\nis no shame in that game. Anyway, roll roll, roll\ninto a spherical shape. Place it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or naked. The parchment paper is\njust for easy cleanup, so it's no worries if\nyou don't wanna use it. Smash it down with your hand. Smash smash, smash. It'll crack a little bit at\nthe edges, but that's okay. And then you're gonna\nmanipulate it into an egg shape. Does not have to be perfect as it will be covered with chocolate. But you know, you can\nfinagle things a bit. My fingers kinda like clip\nit into an egg shape on top. And that one is ready to go. As you move along, just kind of place them\nsome distance apart. See as you squish it\ntogether in your hands, it becomes a nice solid non-crumbly shape. You're also warming the peanut\nbutter and the butter up, which helps it to be more\nmalleable and less cracky. This smells amazing by the way. I actually love Reese's\npeanut butter cups, my dad would bring one home every night as a special treat when\nhe came back from work, maybe not every night, but it seemed like almost every night. So they bring back fond memories, but making them from scratch is so easy and even more delicious. You really realize like, \"Oh, this tastes good, a little sugar \"and nice peanut butter.\" So pat, pat, pat, pat, pat. If you do have an egg-shaped\ncookie cutter, hooray, this is gonna be so easy for you. All you have to do is get that whole batch\nof peanut butter filling, roll it out, you can do\nit in between two pieces of Parchment paper if you want. Pop it into the fridge to set and then cut those eggs out and they'll be totally\nperfect and amazing. But if you don't, we're doing it this way. My eggs are all shaped up,\nI'm quite happy with them. And as one final bit of advice, if you're having a little bit of trouble, you wanna do a little\nbit of final modeling, wash your hands, you dirty\nanimal, just kidding. Wash your hands and then\nleave them a little bit dump. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. And that moisture will really\nhelp you smooth things out. These already to go into\nthe fridge to chill. I'll be leaving them here\nfor like an hour or two, I'm gonna go make dinner, do some dad stuff and when I come back, it's time for the\nchocolate, the best part. I'll be right back. You're gonna use two cups of chocolate and I'm using semi-sweet, but you could use bittersweet. you could use milk chocolate, you could even use white chocolate if you're a glutton for punishment. White chocolate is not easy\nto melt and use for dipping. I'm warning you in advance. Okay, two cups. (chocolate popping) So you could just melt the chocolate, but what we're gonna do is add in just a hair's breadth under\ntwo tablespoons of coconut oil. You could also use shortening, I'm not living at shortening life though, so it's a coconut oil for me. These oils will basically\nlet the chocolate be a little bit more thin and\nmelty and perfect for dipping. So just drizzle that in\nand you have two options, you could use a double boiler, so place this over a small\npot of simmering water or you can pop it into the microwave, which is what I'll be doing today. If you're using a microwave, remember it's short bursts\nof power, low power, so I usually go to 50%, 30 seconds, stir and repeat until\nit's almost all melted. Don't try and melt all the chocolate even if you're using a double boiler, get it to be almost all melted\nand then take it off heat. Stir a couple times and that residual heat will complete the melting process. Very important, otherwise\nyour chocolate could burn. All right, into the microwave. Several 30 second bursts\nin the microwave later at half power, it's all nice and melty. I wanna point out just one more time that when I took it out of\nthe microwave the last time, there was still tons\nof chunks of chocolate that were not melted, but, just a little bit of\nstirring and time did the trick. That residual heat will\nfinish the job for you. Don't burn your chocolate. Just want you to take a look. Look at this, nice and silky, so perfect and it could totally\ncool down a little bit. You can let it come closer to\nroom temperature for dipping or you could dip it right away. But this looks amazing. My little peanut butter eggs\nare all chilled and much firmer and now we're gonna dip them. So this is the only part\nwhere you're gonna use a little bit of ingenuity. You can dip them totally in there, but that could get a little bit messy. So I think I'm gonna try\na couple different ways. A little offset special here and I'm going to place it\nright over the chocolate and then spoon it over. So let's see how that goes. And then you can just tap, tap, tap. (tapping) Cause you wanna get rid of\nsome of the excess chocolate. Now I'm using two skewers. (laughs) Let's try it a different way. Impale your egg, (beeps) using a fork, spoon some chocolate over that egg, then you're going to remove some excess from the side if you need to. Here now we're gonna\ntap the egg on the bowl. This will help us remove\nsome excess chocolate. Swipe across the bottom, get all that extra chocolate off. Now we're gonna place our egg\nback onto our baking sheet. There we go, very nice. Repeat that process and if needed, you can warm your chocolate up a bit. As it cools down, it'll thicken up and make the whole dipping\nprocess more difficult, so feel free to give it\na little bit of a warmup if it starts getting kinda gloopy. You want it nice and thin. While you're dipping your chocolate eggs, you can of course sprinkle delicious and festive things on them. I'm using some confetti sprinkles, just lightly sprinkle the\nsurface while they're still wet, but you can totally do\nanything else you want. I'm gonna do a drizzle of milk\nchocolate on some of these because I love the contrast of the lighter chocolate\non the darker chocolate. Just melt a few tablespoons\nof milk chocolate chips, add into a piping bag\nor regular sandwich bag and snip the tip off. You could use a smaller round tip like a number three or four if you like, but I don't wanna do any more washing up. Rake across the surface\nand create a zigzag pattern and it's that easy, all done. Continue and decorate\nas many as you'd like. I think that a classic, just straight dip in\nchocolate looks beautiful, if you're asking. So I might've had one\nsuper busted (laughs) egg because the chocolate got too cool, but that means that I can\ntaste it on camera for you and not feel bad about it not going into the boys' Easter basket.

Mmmmmmmmmm hmm, that's so nice. I hadn't tempered the chocolate, which you probably could tell, but it still has a little\nbit of a crunch to it and that peanut butter is\non point, perfectly sweet.

Reese's. - Does McDonald's have a\ncopyright on the word supersize? (upbeat music) - There's something a little bit grainy... About the filling. I think the filling is\ngonna be the trickiest part of today's challenge. First things first, we're just\ngonna melt some chocolate. I have no idea how much I'm going to need, so I bought a lot of milk chocolate. I do want to play it safe\nby melting the chocolate over double boiler, nice and slow. I don't wanna scorch\nthe chocolate, burn it, which is a risk if I put\nit directly in the pot. You want the water barely simmering. I'm going to add the bowl on top, and you can see automatically\nit kinda steams up. (Lo empties packet)\nAnd, I'm just gonna go ahead and... Add a lot of chocolate. This is gonna take a while. This is really pretty. Alright, we're gonna pour\nabout a half of this chocolate into the bottom of a deep-dish quiche pan. Ooh. Those ripples. And I'm just gonna kind of... Push up the sides... I wanna make sure that\nall of the chocolate goes into those grooves. Alright, this I'm going to\nfridge for maybe 10 minutes. Hopefully it only takes that long, while we make peanut butter filling. (bleep) It looks like water in\nsome of the grooves. I'm hoping that the\ncondensation from the bowl didn't add water to it.\n- Oh, could be. That's the number, if you\ndo temper chocolate at home, that's the number one\nthing to watch out for, is you don't want any water\nto get into your chocolate, because you will ruin the\ncrystal formations of chocolate. - First I was thinking I\nwas gonna grind up peanuts, but I'm worried that that's just gonna turn into peanut butter. and also give it a natural\npeanut butter taste, which is not what a Reese's is. So, I'm gonna do something\na little weird and funky, and I'm going to grind\nsome graham crackers into fine crumbs, and I'm hoping that gives just like, the very subtle, sandy textures. And now we're gonna make\nthe rest of the filling. Smooth peanut butter,\nnone of that natural crap. We are using... (June laughs)\nSkippy in here. Two cups is a lot of peanut butter. I'm also putting butter in here, I think it's gonna give it\nlike a really nice richness. I'm using powdered sugar, not granulated. Half a cup. So, brown sugar.\n(puts cup down) I'm gonna add my crushed grahams, a little bit of vanilla, and then salt. Reese's has a nice\namount of salt, I think. So I'm starting out\nwith a teaspoon of salt and seeing where that takes us. Beat it until it's nice and creamy. It smells amazing. It's definitely not super smooth, which I did on purpose. And I think we gotta go in and taste it. Mmm! It's really good. It's\na little bit darker, more like caramel color than the OG. - I have a feeling that they use dehydrated peanut powder. I mean, there's no doubt\nthis is better than that, 'cause you can taste the\npeanut butter and the vanilla. - It's a little saltier.\n- Mm-hmm. - I think I'm gonna run with it. Don't worry. It's looking okay. I don't think I totally screwed it up. And it's actually already\nkind of coming off the sides, so that's giving me hope. And now I'm just gonna carefully\nload this into the center. Buttering it into an even layer, leaving a border around the edge, 'cause I wanna just\npour the chocolate over so it reaches everywhere, there's no weird peanut butter gap, which actually happens in some Reese's. June.\n- [June] Yeah? - Do we anticipate any problem if I pour over the melted\nchocolate that I have now? - Uh-huh?\n- And then, add more if I need to later? - If you're chilling them separately, the two halves might separate but... I don't think it would be a big problem. (Lo puts knife down) - Do I wanna make more\npeanut butter filling? - I would go more, 'cause I don't think I can\nhandle that much chocolate. - We're going more of the Mini route. Fat guy. Bigger filling. Taller filling, so... Just give me a sec. June's melting me more chocolate\nand making more filling. (chill pop music) And let's pour.\n(pop synth) I really wanna keep the nice swirls, but that's not really\nthe style of Reese's. June...\n- Mm-hmm? I would just shake it back and forth. Maybe like drop it a little, to make sure it's\nsettling in all the gaps. - Into the fridge... For I'm not sure how\nlong. Maybe 20 minutes. (giggles)\nOr maybe a while longer. Around the cheese. And looks pretty dang set so... I'm so nervous about the scallops. - We can torch it. We\ncan torch the outside. - To warm it up and pop it?\n- Mm-hmm. (June torches foil) - Oh yeah. You can kinda... - [June] It's starting.\n- [Lo] It's releasing! (Lo sets pan down)\n- Then... Yeah. - Oooooh!\n(sets pan on cookie sheet) - [June] Looks like I\nheated it up too much. But this side looks good.\n(chuckles) The next time, we'll\nhave to have patience. - Yes.\n- And not heat gun it. - All right. We're gonna see if... (Lo sets pan down) We cover it up, we smoothed out the edges. The good news is, is that\nit has such good potential. (chuckles)\nIt could be really pretty, it just looks a little bit javey. (slow electronic music) June for scale. - Way too much sugar.\n- Ignore her. (laughs)\n- It's so gooey! - Do you see we had\ntrouble getting it out? - Do you remember that I went\nthrough that entire bag... - Yeah.\n- [June] And Lena too. - And they were...\n- And we shot those. - Ugly. (laughs)\n- Yeah. (slow electronic music) - [June] Why isn't it pulling? - Yeah.\n- And there we go. (puts knife down)\n- Oh my God. - [Lo] Look how similar the inside looks. - The peanut butter is, I think, bubba. - I will say I'm not sure I like... The butter in here.\n- Okay, next time I think I would\nspray the pan with PAM, and that's it.\n(laughs) - She's perfect.\n- Nice job.

and you want to make sure that you're going up the sides of the pan you also want to make sure you that you're doing this pretty evenly because if you have any like holes or gaps or whatever you just don't want them then you know pop that in the refrigerator to set now we're gonna go on to the filling so peanut butter cups obviously don't just have peanut butter filling fun fact it's kind of like a fluffier crumbly texture so I'm trying to emulate that I mixed peanut butter and I mixed up peanut butter with powdered sugar and butter I prefer creamy peanut butter for sure so what's the bottom shelf the chocolate has cooled and set in a pour that peanut butter filling we just made right onto there and spread that out nice and evenly then of course we're gonna top that with some more melted chocolate and spread that out evenly and then pop it back in the fridge finally set so if you want to make this recipe I highly recommend getting yourself one of these tart shell pants that pops out just gonna make your life a whole lot easier you only have like a regular tart pan you could just still go for it it'll still be delicious so then like I said you want this tart shell pan because you can literally just pop up the bottom and serve that's literally all you have to do for this giant peanut butter cup ain't so easy but so delicious I serve this kind of like cake again cuz I mean you could just take a big bite out of it and eat the whole thing but if you want to share cut a big slice and paint it like that but again you could literally just bite out of it take a buddy do you and if you make this let me know I want to see it slide into my DMS gosh stop saying that a lot of times when I've made giant foods they've turned out to be a giant mess but this one was really simple and obviously delicious if you wanna see me make more giant foods you can always subscribe to my youtube channel I don't know how that correlates but you can have to do one every five giant you either get a pond or song that's all I got [Music] [Music] [Music]", "VrAhW9uuEaA": "[Music] welcome back to you in the kitchen with Matt I am your host Matt Taylor today I'm going to show you how to make better than Reese's peanut butter cups that are heart-shaped oh yeah valentine's Day is upon us what better way to show your appreciation for your Valentine then homemade peanut butter cups shaped like a heart as you know I love peanut butter cups especially if you follow my show I'd have what four or five videos that it gave you the peanut butter cups reason why they're super easy to do one of my go-to treats really easy and they're very versatile they they mold really well in the different shapes and whatnot and they they last a long time you can store them in the fridge and the freezer so without further ado let's get started alright first what you want to do you want to pick up a heart shape silicone mold I got this one which is suitable for cupcakes or other chocolate candies I also have this smaller one has these little designs which are really cool you can pick these up online I'll put a link down below we can get them you can also use a like a cookie cutter and I have a video where I make a large peanut butter cup that's heart-shaped using a cookie cutter I'll put a link down below if you want to check out that video alright so what we do what we do we start with a half cup of peanut butter and then what we're gonna do is add a little bit of salt this is about a 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of melted butter if you use salted butter then don't add this salt this is unsalted butter now I have a 1/2 cup of powdered sugar here as well so I'm going to add most of this just save a little bit left and get a spoon a large spoon and we'll just go ahead and mix this all together and you can use your spoon to kind of push down and so we want what we want is we want our consistency to be like play-doh where it's not extremely sticky and where you can hold it in your hands without sticking a Tong and so if it's a little too sticky it's a little bit too sticky I'm gonna add the rest of this powdered sugar in there all right so when you grab it you should be able to mold it in your hand like this without it sticking a ton for our chocolate I have two different types of milk chocolate here you can see the different colors this is a symphony bar Hershey's symphony bar this is just a classic Hershey's bar you can use whatever chocolate you want I'm gonna melt this in the microwave and start on bursts of 25 30 seconds stir 25-30 seconds stir and then 10 seconds and that should get it nice and melted we'll go to that step alright my chocolate is melted it's a nice runny consistency another thing you do if you really want a nice peanut butter flavor like more than normal then add some peanut butter about 1/4 of a cup to half of a cup of peanut butter in with your chocolate as your melt it oh it's awesome if you only use one Hershey bar then just use a quarter cup of peanut butter in with your chocolate awesome now what we're gonna do is we have our mold here and I'm just gonna go ahead and pour some in on the bottom of each of these about it it's about a whole teaspoon worth keeping teaspoon all right so will tap it and level out the bottom and then we'll do is we'll grab some of our peanut butter about that much and then you can just shape it a little bit you can just shape it into like a heart you don't have to be totally precise with this and just drop it down on the bottom and you want the you don't want the peanut butter to really touch the edges a whole lot because you want the chocolate to go all the way around it but essentially just do that all right once you have a little peanut butter once you have the peanut butter in there we'll go ahead and take our chocolate again and if you run out of the chocolate just go ahead and melt some more and then you wind up using about the same amount just go ahead and move it around there alright once you have the chocolate on top we'll go ahead and tap it so I get the level another thing that I like to do is I like to do different flavors of chocolate like dark chocolate on the bottom and then we'll chocalate on the top and then drizzle a white chocolate and then if there's spots where you see the peanut butter just go ahead and with your spoon and just tap it down I'll get to cover it up or if you need to add a little bit more chocolate go ahead and do that okay again we'll just tap it it nice and level alright there we go and now let's go ahead and put this in the fridge for about 30 minutes all right our peanut butter cup hearts have set and now what you do you just come in here you can just pull on the side of it or just push up on the bottom of your mold and look at the Hat heart right there oh my gosh isn't that really cool and it's a peanut butter cup and just put it on there I'm gonna put it on my little cake stand and do that with all the rest of the molds I'm gonna grab this other mold here and show you just pull on the side a little bit push up on the bottom and let it come on out see if you'll notice here's parts where the chocolate didn't go all the way around that's okay look at that cool design there we go homemade better than Reese's Peanut Butter Cup hearts all right our homemade peanut butter cup heart shapes are done they turned out fantastic and really easy to do sure to impress your friends and family the reason why I call them better than rhesus is because they are better than rhesus I challenge you to make these and then compare them to Reese's peanut butter cups and see which ones you like better all right and if you don't want to bother with the heart-shaped mold just go ahead and grab some paper cups like you would for cupcakes and then you can make classic peanut butter cup shapes that way really easy to do if I can do it you can do it I'm Matt Taylor this has been another episode of in the kitchen with Matt thank you for joining me as always if you have any questions or comments put them down below and I will get back to you as soon as I can thumbs up down on the corner push it don't forget to subscribe to my channel take care time for me to dive into one of these oh yeah I'm gonna grab this little guy right here [Music]", "UTXNOJZ1VK4": "hi guys Angela Kim from the squishy monster comm and today I'm bringing you some super simple 2 ingredient chocolate peanut butter cups these Reese's homemade Reese's Cups are exponentially better than their store counterpart with just two ingredients they couldn't be easier to whip up and these will be a perfect addition to my gift baskets these are just one of the goodies I'm tucking in for my presents by homemade presents for my friends and family this year and also included are going to be some homemade candles and soaps so let me know in the comments below if you would like to see this it is as well the first couple things I'm going to do is line my cupcake tin and I'm choosing to use minis today but you can of course make these however large you like and then I'm going to melt my chocolate and it's best to do this over a double boiler of course but it's easier still to zap this in the microwave in 20 to 30 second bursts and then kind of stirring in between just make sure that you do it low and slow so you don't scorch your chocolate and that you don't have any trace of liquid in there which will make your chocolate C's and I'm choosing to use semi-sweet or bittersweet but you can use milk chocolate whatever you really like and next I'm just going to heat up my peanut butter you can also use a variety of nut butters I love doing this with almond butter and I actually showed you guys how to make your own homemade peanut butter in my pupcake video I'll link that if you're interested and also you don't even have to stick with any type of nut butters you can even expand your horizons into Nutella or whatever you really want to squish the middle with so I'm just going to loosen this up by heating it a little bit so I can kind of pour it or nudge it into the middle now I'm going to let these set just so that it'll be a more of a firm surface that I can lay more chocolate on to that way it won't be bleeding into each other when your peanut butter and your chocolate layers is set that you can touch them and they're kind of firm to the touch you can nudge on that chocolate layer so you can sandwich your peanut butter in the center and you can either do this manually and just spread it to the edge or you can just put on a dollop and like I showed you earlier just wrap it really friendly on the counter top to have that flat surface here are just a few of my chocolate buttercups and I just unwrapped this guy so I could show you the definitive layers of chocolate and peanut butter running throughout and all of them look like that but I'm going to keep some of them unwrapped so I can wrap them up in some silver or gold foil and I think I'm going to tap them into holiday gift baskets put them in the stocking stuffers the options are unlimited and they're so easy and incredibly yummy with just two ingredients it's so unbeatable and I hope you guys give us a try this holiday season and if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to share like and subscribe I want to thank you guys ringing out with me this is Angela Kim from the squishy monster.com and I'll see you I see my very good baby you should it's benign", "r7E7AdxLowg": "hi everyone and welcome back today's recipe is for almond butter cups they are decadent rich with a nice contrast of dark chocolate and sweet almond butter filling and yes we are gonna make the chocolate from scratch so let's get started I'm gonna make the almond butter filling first I'm using coconut sugar as the sweetener which needs to be ground into a very fine powder I always use a high speed blender to grind up the coconut sugar but a coffee grinder works just as well you might even want to save the powdered coconut sugar to make sure there are no clumps and it's really fine your almond butter filling will only be as smooth as the coconut sugar it's really important that you use a powdered sweetener and not a liquid one as I have mentioned in one of my previous videos nut butters and liquid sweeteners do not mix well just as oil and water do not mix so if you mix the almond butter with for instance maple syrup the mixture will seize up meaning that it will form a more of a thick paste rather than a smooth sailing [Music] once your almond butter filling is ready transfer it to a piping bag this is not necessary but I find that it's much easier and more precise to pipe the filling rather than spoon it on the chocolate I usually just line a glass with a piping bag and spoon the filling right in if you don't have a piping bag you could also use just a regular ziplock bag and then cut off one of the corners [Music] [Music] [Music] alright now on to the chocolate if you have ever made chocolate from scratch you have probably heard of cacao butter which is the fat extracted from cocoa bean if you don't have access to cacao butter you could just use coconut oil however I do have to say that cacao butter is superior to coconut oil when making chocolate because not only does it give chocolate the mouthfeel you're so familiar with but it also melts at a higher temperature than coconut oil the easiest way to milk the cow butter is to shave it and then set up a double broiler the only thing you have to pay attention to is that absolutely no water gets into the cacao butter if it does it will seize up [Music] take the cacao butter off the heat when it's about 50% melted and then let the residual heat of the bowl melt the rest of it [Music] the next ingredient is cacao powder you could also use cocoa powder if you'd like and then a sweetener [Music] I'm again using our powdered coconut sugar for exactly the same reason I used coconut sugar for the almond butter oil and water just don't mix I can't stress enough how important it is that your coconut sugar is very finely ground the coconut sugar will mix with the cacao butter but it won't dissolve in it so if your coconut sugar is grainy your chocolate will end up being grainy as well now you might have seen recipes on the internet for raw chocolate using coconut oil cacao powder and maple syrup you might have also seen comments below those recipes that the maple syrup sank to the bottom and the top of the chocolate was devoid of sweetness the reason is that the coconut oil simply doesn't mix with the maple syrup it will appear as if it's mixed for as long as you're stirring the chocolate mixture but as soon as you stop stirring it the maple syrup is separate from the coconut oil to make the almond butter cups line a mini muffin pan with paper liners and spoon about 1 TSP of chocolate into the muffin liner just so you know I did temper half of the chocolate that I'm spooning in so it stays firm at room temperature but that's totally up to you you don't have to do that if you're interested in learning how to make tempered chocolate using the exact chocolate recipe I do have a video on my channel already and I'll link to it in the description box below let the chocolate set for a few minutes and then pipe a little bit of the almond butter mixture on top of it do you make sure that the chocolate has hardened before you add the almond butter so the almond butter doesn't sink to speed up the hardening process place the mini muffin pan into the freezer for a few minutes when you're piping the almond butter filling try to keep it from the sides of the cupcake liners there should still be some room left for chocolate finally divide the remaining chocolate among the almond butter cups I usually use about 2 to 3 teaspoons per [Music] place the almond butter cups into the freezer to set and you are done [Music] [Music] I am the type of person who can eat the same thing for like a week straight and not mind Tanner on the other hand is quite different and when I pick something for supper he eats it for supper then he eats it the next day for a lunch and then he's kind of done with it and wants something different which can be frustrating when I want a batch cook so I always try to think of how I can add variety with the same ingredients so say that I'm making tempered chocolate which I do like to make a lot off now I make it into chocolate bar chocolate bark that I popped with some nuts and seeds and dried fruit and these almond butter cups how do you like them I do too as wonderful as I understand it's on your website already yeah so that's a good thing I would say use lots of that almond butter because it's really good and interacts with the flavor of the dark chocolate look however your proportion of like dark chocolate to almond butter should be like 60/40 60% almond butter 40% dark chocolate that's my suggestion don't know how you're going to do that but try the if you're expecting like a milk chocolate no it's not like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup where it's milk chocolate on the outside it's like a dark chocolate tempered dark chocolate so it's got the same kind of texture as a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but it's like stronger there's a little bit more crunch to the chocolate which is good and then it's a dark chocolate flavor and the internals the almond butter tastes way better than but ER you'd finally seen America I find that they can be like quite be hydrated that version of peanut butter so this is like really moist and savory on the inside a little bit of sweet in there too it all works really well today yeah the almond butter is my favorite part too because it's my butter that I'm kind of obsessed with so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give me thumbs up comment below subscribe to my channel and I'll see you next time [Music]", "084s7kqzD3Q": "whether it's vegan restaurants um vegan products they end up tasting really good because i mean they get really into the seasoning and making it taste up to par and lenny layers definitely tastes better than this to be honest what's up diabetes nation we are back with another food test review and up again we have quest nutrition here i have the quest cookie and also quest peanut butter cups i'm actually pretty excited to try these peanut butter cups i haven't had peanut butter cups in years like since i was a kid but i'm first going to start with the cookie because i what i want to do is compare this to lennon larry's complete cookie so taking a look at the back of the nutrition label here for one whole cookie it's 250 calories 17 grams of fat 19 grams of carbs 15 grams of protein so slightly higher than the lennon larry cookie that i tried in the previous episode but the usual cookie that's sold by len and larry's is the complete like the full cookie so it's going to be double what it actually says on the label so about 400 calories so i think i believe newt quest nutrition only sells this size so it actually is going to be less than what you typically buy from linen layers it says soft and chewy on the front so i'm going to see how true that is i mean definitely feel soft the lennon larry's wasn't that chewy until you warmed it up so that's something to take note of if you want a chewier cookie maybe quest might be the one for you otherwise if you want something that's a bit more on the firm side len and larry's is good now i'm gonna try this i'm gonna eat it without warming it up first but then of course i have to warm it up because there's a difference so i had an interesting smell immediately as i opened it up i don't really know how to describe it i think it's the chocolate i don't know what differently they do with their chocolate but um with lennon larry's they don't have any dairy egg soy this does contain egg soy wheat peanuts or no sorry it's processed in a facility that also processes egg soy wheat peanuts and tree nuts contains milk so there's dairy in this um yeah but i'm gonna try it and see what it tastes like first based on how it looks the cookies you know it's really light as you can see um kind of crumbly okay this is not bad i'm not crazy about it as far as the taste goes whatever they do to make the cookie is just not it's not that tasty um i do prefer letting layers we're talking about flavor um which is interesting because that's a completely vegan cookie and they often say like whether it's vegan restaurants um vegan products they end up tasting really good because i mean they get really into the seasoning and making it taste up to par and lenny layers definitely tastes better than this to be honest yeah i'm not crazy about it it's the cookie itself i mean the chips the chips are very light in flavor um they're not very sweet but whatever whatever the recipe is however they make the cookie it's okay like i wouldn't i'd prefer the lennon larry's over this maybe they have other flavors that taste better than the chocolate chip this is the only one i picked up but as far as the chocolate chip goes i don't know it's okay i'll give us like a six now for the fun one and i hope this one doesn't disappoint because i'm actually looking forward to it i've never tried these a protein peanut butter cup seems pretty cool but yeah let's see how this tastes okay cool not too big in size but they definitely do look like reese's peanut butter cups um so for two of these not just one it's 190 calories 15 grams of fat 13 grams of carbs and 11 grams of protein so always make sure to look at the back of the nutrition label because sometimes it might just be for one but [Music] but in this case it's two so let's get into it these are really good if you love reese's peanut butter cups if you're a reese's peanut butter cups person you're going to like these you say it's fantastic the balance could be a bit better there's definitely a lot more chocolate than the peanut butter but um it's it's good if you're not complaining it's smooth there's no weird aftertaste or anything like that it's a really solid solid protein reese's peanut butter cup or solid quest nutrition peanut butter cup so really good if you want to have a sweet treat every now and then if you want to just satisfy some cravings for chocolate if you're a chocolate person definitely get these 190 calories so not too bad and but they're going to be a lot more nutritionally better for you than having a reese's peanut butter cup definitely get these i would give these a solid 8.5 8.3 around there but that's it for the review though the cookie was not a fan of the taste um yes it was chewy i didn't really really need to heat it up because after i tasted it i was like i mean maybe i should have heated up i don't know i just i wasn't really a fan of the taste i don't think that would have helped it you know so maybe go with the led and larry's lenny larry's um it was okay so yeah i gave this one a six 8.3 8.5 these are delicious but that's it for the review i'm definitely gonna continue trying some more quest nutrition products but i'm also gonna mix it up try to find some more unknown brands that have healthier or protein versions and some of your favorite snacks and foods", "nhOk2apbL0Q": "hey dudes and girls back in the kitchen with another buff dudes food recipe today we're gonna be making protein peanut butter cups

you", "R7SbczOlHzM": "welcome to the daily D and today we have another recipe for you today we are making Reese's Peanut Butter Cup fudge and it's super simple and it requires just three different ingredients condensed milk two bits of chocolate chips and 15 peanutbutter cups now let's get this go my two packages of milk chocolate chocolate chips are in the bowl that works out to be three cups of chocolate chips I've cut up three of the packages into kind of rough sized pieces okay not too big and I'm reciever reserving two packages for the top and all I'm going to do is pour the sweetened condensed milk into a microwave-safe Bowl and make sure use a spatula find something if you don't have one to really clean out this sweetened condensed milk because quite a bit of it does stay behind if you don't use it you want to make sure you get it all in okay once it's in I just give it a quick stir and I'm going to pop this into the microwave for 45 seconds and then I'm going to keep doing it at 30-second intervals just until this is completely combined and all of the chocolate chips are completely melted so on to our first 45 seconds okay first 45 seconds as you can see it's starting to melt it doesn't take much and we're not trying to boil this or cook this the entire idea is to get it nice and smooth but as you can see it's kind of chunky still and it's not quite as melted as I'd like so this is going to go back in the microwave for about 25-30 seconds okay 30 seconds more and the chocolate is looking to be pretty well melted but I'm gonna put it in for about 15 seconds more I'm just looking for it to be a little more glossy see how it's starting to get a little gloss to it so this is gonna go back in for another 30 okay now as you can see it's the consistency is different see how shiny it is it's not as dull it's not super hot it's just melted so we did maybe two minutes I think around okay so that's nice and creamy and these these peanut butter cups these three packages I did in about six pieces for each cup each cup was cut into six pieces and all I'm doing is stirring them in to the fudge trying to get that evenly you're not trying to really melt the peanut butter cut cups in here you kind of want them chunky and then we're just going to immediately transfer this to a parchment lined up 8 inch square 9 inch square hand [Music] so working quickly I'm just patting this into the pan okay some of the peanut butter cups will melt and then I'm just taking these that I just cut in half and I'm just placing these like pushing them into the the fudge [Music] okay and this is just gonna be popped into the fridge until it's completely set and that's around an hour and a half to two hours depending from the temperature of your fridge and we'll see you back then so five minutes less than five minutes of work and two hours in the fridge and this is what you have this awesome Reese's Peanut Butter Cup fudge that has the actual you know peanut butter cups in it you get that incredible flavor but it's not overwhelming it's amazing give it a try thanks for watching and don't forget to check out our recipes like playlist for all of our recipes", "ex_Yw5nhgfw": "hey guys how are you doing it's been a while since I've done any food videos on my channel I don't know what's the matter with me I guess I went to America a few times and a tree unhealthily so when I got back here I didn't really fancy making big tasty sugary bad food desserts I'm a different person but don't worry I'm back at it once again this time making some peanut butter cups there actually aren't too bad for you they're kind of healthy it's all like good fats and there's no sugar I mean gonna use a healthy alternative to sugar so let's all lie to ourselves and pretend that this is a super-duper healthy treat that's going to help you lose weight and get big muscles and be strong yeah this is the line but relatively speaking it's not all that bad so let's give it a go so to make these at home you will need to make these at home you will need some peanut butter obviously the aunt figured that out by now and what's wrong with your cocoa powder some coconut oil that's the healthy fats healthy some cupcake cases or fairy cake cases won't for quite small ones so they don't turn out too big some vanilla extract and some sweet now this is one I'm using you can use whatever you want you can to do sugar if you want to be unhealthy oh my god gross manganese xylitol if you just before Nestle's it's got a lot less calories and sugar does it's got a lower glycemic index by systemic GI it's got a lower GI which means that it gives you less of like blood sugar spike so it's better if you in that way it's all natural it's just like a bit better than sugar basically oh I got this stuff of Amazon but your local health food shop will probably have something very similar too let's get started so there's going to be two layers to these just like your favorite Reese's Pieces so the top layer will be more peanut buttery in the bottom layer will be more chocolaty which is your favorite layer the peanut butter or the chocolate vote in a poll ha I just I'm gonna do a poll in this video click on the I and the whole thing will appear both peanut butter versus chocolate which you prefer do it I'm gonna start with a bottom layer to do that you need two tablespoons of coconut oil you probably going to find this a lot easier if you microwave this a tiny bit just to get it melted there we go that's gonna be a lot easier now you can just pour it pour this bottom layer we need two tablespoons of the coconut oil and liquid form a quarter of a cup of peanut butter you wanna make sure it's a smooth one otherwise you're gonna get lumps in your peanut butter cup then you also want a teaspoon of vanilla vanilla extract pop that in there a quarter of a cup of cocoa powder and you want the unsweetened stuff so not like drinking chocolate that would work needs to be cocoa powder oh no I'm ready got enough after delve into my second cocoa powder it is unsweetened that is organic these are now organic healthy Reese's Pieces I mean peanut butter cups and finally what we missing sweetener sweetener sugar the xylitol the recipe I'm using says to use liquid stevia don't know what the hell buys so I'm gonna use the xylitol and I'm gonna have to guess gonna add it to taste pour some in and see if it's sweetened up I guess gonna start with four tablespoons fortunately I am an expert Baker so I know these things very well hopefully this mixes well if it doesn't you might need to heat it up a tiny bit in the microwave just to make the peanut butter a bit smoother it's definitely a very easy recipe like I'm pretty sure you can make these quicker than the trip to the supermarket if you go all the stuff let's give it a try yeah this will case test mmm I'm gonna say it could do with a little bit more sugar so I'm gonna have another tablespoon mmm oh I could just eat that on its own okay it has mixed well but I'm gonna just zap it in the microwave really quickly just cuz you know it's really thick and it's gonna be quite hard to get into the cases and then I'm gonna do it for like 10 20 seconds much better okay so now I can take my small cupcake liners and fill them up with the chocolate goodness gonna fill up roughly halfway so just a nice generous spoon into each one and try not to get it like trying to make a mess try to go straight into the cupcake liner as then I look pretty and Instagram a ball and you can put more Pinterest definitely make sure your mixture is like running up otherwise this would be very tricky gosh that was a lot of effort I mean you could just eat it straight from the bowl if you want if you're super late but they will look good I promise you so once you've done all that then just put these into the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes until they're completely set so then we can do the next layer you want it to be quirky good like freeze them at an angle and to normal for that I guess meanwhile we can work on the other layer you are now an expert this as it's basically all the same - of cocoa powder so again two tablespoons of the coconut oil 1/4 of a cup of peanut butter half a teaspoon of vanilla oh it's changed this time I hope you're paying attention in poverty spoon not a teaspoon and actually is pretty different because no sugar in this layer either was going for straight peanut butter and oil great the bit easier to mix this time is you don't have the cocoa powder in there to like make it super thick okay that was annoyingly quick to do now I've got to just wait them to finish in the freezer I guess will give me time to wash up yeah pushing up and back I just discovered a fun game look okay yeah these are looking setting up for my liking and my cover to be bothered to wait any longer you know got things to do he would see what does that I do all day again pull the peanut butter on top down here again and make much do all my videos from down here hey guys and today I'm making peanut butter cups whatever shut up Doug peanut butter guys um don't make a mess peanut butter goes on top of a baby Vivat peanut butter and the group of the dogs now it's hilarious you should try it hurry that's how they make them look like they're talking in movies and we're good now back into the freezer Carol because this is now a little bit more wobbly delicately back into the freezer yeah now we got away again ooh finally they are ready yay I shouldn't say that long it was like 10-15 minutes I think I decorated them with some desiccated coconut to make them look all pretty and healthy yeah and now it's time to try them here we go it looks really nice it looks just like a Reese's Pieces peanut butter cup but it's healthy that's the wonderful thing about it it's healthy yes we're still telling ourselves that come in longer oh it's really good that's really nice very rich that mmm-hmm to know what possibly even better than a Reese's Pieces I always find them a little bit too sickly this is this a crime just right I'm liking this you've got to try this at home if you're a fan of the Reese's Pieces peanut butter cups because these are a lot better I think in my opinion wait can we call these I Doug's pieces Doug's peanut butter cups yeah doesn't

my gosh I put my life on the internet what was I thinking idiot but I do it'll free you everything I do I'll start with a lyric thing okay see you guys again on Wednesday bye", "GKf1PyoTINY": "[Music] good afternoon guys welcome back to magic baking and welcome back to another kind of junk food review I think today I am really excited to be reviewing and taste testing for you guys a brand new product that I have been waiting so long to try by so long I mean about three days since they actually announced and delivered the product to its first vitamins I have a lot of patience today I am reviewing for you a product from one of my favorite favorite brands now these guys make peanut butter if you've ever heard of PIP and nut you're a very lucky person because it means you've been getting some good peanut butter love it in your life if not you need to try it it's a slightly more premium price brand you're talking kind of three pounds for a jar but oh my god it's worth it so Pippa not on a uk-based company they roast their own peanuts and they make incredible palm oil free and usually kind of junk free peanut butter and it tastes amazing normally these kind of healthier peanut butters you get are quite terrible they're really bland or they taste very earthy and just very healthful and you don't always want that you know but Pippa not are doing healthy right something they have done to make me just an even bigger fan of the brand before I've even tasted this stuff is they have released their own version of Reese's peanut butter cups and boy am I excited to eat these so just exactly like a classic American Reese's Peanut Butter Cup this is a milk chocolate Cup with peanut butter in it fancy that they have also released a dark chocolate versions and even a dark chocolate almond butter cup so I'm really excited to taste these let's do it so I think it only makes sense to try the milk chocolate peanut butter cup first so it just like a pack of Reese's there are two peanut butter cups in here and it's made with real peanut butter there is no palm oil blah blah blah all great stuff the chocolate around is ethically sourced so basically everything sounds fantastic and today I just want to taste it and let you know worth your money let's get into it so I got these from their online store which I would linked in the description box below I believe they are also available in Sainsbury's probably Waitrose on in whole food stores at the moment so you should be able to get your paws on them somewhere so we open these up much like peanut butter cups as I said there are two in here with a little bit of a cardboard sleeve and they smell so good I also very much appreciate I don't know if the light will actually show this but they kind of look like they have little nipples more mature here so we're gonna take one of these and just let's take a closer look at it so overall it does look very much like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup the chocolate looks like a little bit kind of darker or that there's a higher cocoa content at least it looks to me Elizabeth thinner but also a kind of a bit wider than a peanut butter cup it smells a lot more chocolatey Reese's peanut butter cups have a very distinct peanut butter smell the chocolate also has a better shine to it which makes me think I might have a better texture because sometimes Reese's Cups can be very soft and almost too melty not that I ever complain when I'm eating one anyway let's taste the PIP not peanut butter cup so let me just give you a close-up this is what our filling looks like you can see that there's probably an even kind of ratio between the chocolate and the peanut butter it's a generous chocolate that has a great kind of texture to it it doesn't have a distinct super high-quality snap to it but it definitely has better texture than a Reese's there's also a much more kind of balanced flavor between chocolate and peanut butter I think with a Reese's Cup because I believe it's that kind of typical American Hershey's milk chocolate which has vegetable oil some way too much sugar I'm not enough decent quality cocoa and this definitely tastes more like a chocolate snack as much as it is a peanut butter snack if that makes sense has a great texture overall sometimes peanut butter can be really kind of drying you know and you can put it in your mouth and it just saps all the moisture and enjoyment from your life but that because probably because of the cocoa butter and the Chocolate it turns into a very smooth kind of expedience and I just want more basically genuinely very good not too sweet a nice kind of decent quality tasting milk chocolate it tastes like it's probably about 30 to 40 percent cocoa which is a lot stronger than the cocoa content of a Reese's Cup for example I am very excited to taste the other two and then I think we'll talk about rating so let's get into it I think I wiggle or do dark chocolate peanut butter cups next now I also just want to take a minute to shout out the packaging I just think is really pretty it's a kind of sick almost papery feeling plastic stuff so these much likely no profit ones are about 101 calories each again it's all ethically sourced local no palm oil and peanut butter so why don't we say dark chocolate the dark chocolate peanut butter cups are 61% cocoa where does the milk was 40 percent so 40 percent is a very good kind of percentage for milk chocolate typically standard cheap milk chocolate is anywhere between 20 and 30 okay so we have our dark chocolate ones here again nice little pain of nipples on top there so these are noticeably darker obviously candy it's not even something you would really need to bring up they smell a lot richer let's see how they taste it's going in that is a proper sexy grownup peanut butter cup this is a university-educated peanut butter it is rich the cocoa is that gorgeous kind of grown-up bittersweet flavor like I said nothing too bitter you can tell it's a decent quality cocoa is very rich it's got great texture it goes so well with the peanut butter and the peanut butter actually kind of mellows out any bitterness from the chocolate well it's obviously not the best quality dark chocolate I've ever had it's certainly delicious and I certainly won't order the peanut butter I think in this one almost stands out a bit more I didn't expect the chocolate is obviously the dominant flavor because of the quantity of n because of the strength of the cocoa in there but the peanut butter actually stands out a lot more against this I don't know if it's because the milk chocolate was a bit kind of richer in itself in texture and in kind of fattiness but the peanut butter stands out really well on this one it's an amazing combo so let's try out the almond butter kind again love the packaging I don't know why they've decided to go for a dark and almond instead of milk and almond but here we are I think generally I prefer peanut butter to almond butter because again almond butter can be very kind of you know health food but I have high hopes for this again this one is 61% cocoa so it's the same dark chocolate as in our last one again a dominant smell it's obviously that dark chocolate we have our friendly little nipple in the front there let's give it a taste oh wow I am very pleasantly surprised that almond butter flavor is a lot stronger and a lot more punchy and I expected in a really really good way again the chocolate has that kind of bittersweet nature to it I'm not the best quality chocolate I've ever had but certainly a very very decent dark chocolate the texture speed on there it's got that same kind of snap that the other two have had which is always absent from a Reese's Cup the common butter is almost a better pairing for the chocolate than the peanut butter which I didn't think I would ever say it's got this kind of aromatic sweetness the peanut butter you're almost expecting that kind of cheap trashy Reese's flavor and it's a bit mellower where does the almond there is so powerful but in a good way and it really stands up well to that chocolate I expected these to be kind of the least exciting of the flavors but I think they might be my favorite I am very impressed with those speaking overall I'm not surprised at how much I enjoyed these while obviously and there is always a place in my heart for Reese's peanut butter cups because they have such a unique flavor and everyone loves a bit of cheap trashy junk food treats times but these are if you're looking for something a bit higher quality a bit more ethical a bit healthier for you these are definitely definitely a solid replacement for those like I said they should also be fairly widely available and if not you can buy them online I am super happy to do these I'm a huge Pippin not found as it was so I didn't ever expect these to be bad really let's be honest but honestly I would thoroughly recommend these the flavor is good they're rich they're satisfying it's a great snack they're portable I'm a big fan and I'm gonna give these a solid 5 out of 5 which if you're wondering is probably also why we'd give a Reese's Cup anyway seriously definitely recommend you to get your hands on those if you have ever tried Pippin up peanut butter and you're a fan girl like me let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor is I've been unashamedly obsessed with their pumpkin spice almond butter recently and I realize that as the whitest thing I have ever said if you guys enjoyed

I'm I'd review a lot of people had these already and I think everybody already knows they're great but I'm gonna do it anyway we got some tongue zero peanut butter toast this is milk chocolate white chocolate and dark chocolate all right let's see the ingredients of the dark chocolate ones first and green is dark chocolate which is unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter soluble corn fiber sunflower lecithin monkford extract Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans then roasted peanuts cocoa butter peanut flour sea salt mint fruit extract xanthan gum guar gum and natural vanilla flavor ingredients on this one I'm gonna guess it's the same except for the chocolate it is so this is the same except the chocolate the first ingredients watch Auklet which is cocoa butter whole milk powder soluble corn fodder sunflower lecithin monk fruit extract Madagascar bourbon and vanilla beans and now the milk chocolate is looks like it's the same thing step for the first ingredient is milk chocolate which is unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter whole milk powder soluble corn fiber sunflower lecithin Munford extract Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans that's all three of them so what is give them a try oh nutrition 70 calories 80 calories 80 calories so the dark chocolate is one less calorie or 10 less calories serving size are 1 cup 1 p.m. dark up protein to 3 and 2 so the white chocolate has 3 protein dark and milk have 2 protein carbs these two have 5 carbs for fiber so 1 net carb the white chocolate actually has one sugar this has zero the milk chocolate has 4 carbs and 3 fiber and one sugar so one less total carb and then fast this one six six and six yep tall six okay okay dark chocolate they come in little individual packs which is awesome I guess if I turn to throw away this is how it goes type of zero and I didn't even notice this before they have the nutrition label individually on the back of these packages and the ingredients so you don't even have to keep the big bags or know what's in it there's there's what it looks like this is a very high quality game ever cut for four or five carbs wherever you are total when that carb having a couple of these a week is awesome it's Saturday so I'm going to have more than a couple is late because I have a couple right now now I've never been the biggest white chocolate fan to begin with she's never been my favorite the top zero makes them really good white chocolate here we go we got their logo wanna dig in definitely has more white chocolate taste my wife loves these if you have to watch I'll if you like white chocolate you're probably least like these quantum yep I don't think it's as good as these other ones but I would not be disappointed if they only have white chocolate too because it's still really good now milk chocolate another one kept sorry so let's open this one up and give it a try so again it's kind of the same the same kind of thing alright the inside of it this one my my favorite I don't like dark chocolate bitter chocolate but these are all really good this is my favorite no chocolate in dark chocolate my chocolate my wife would say white chocolate milk chocolate and dark a little don't put words in my mouth but I believe that is the way she would she would say she loves the washhouse almonds that's my review how to recommend these it looks like they're finally back in stock and staying in stock so you're going to fight for them like you used to grape on you", "pMzYhy9GXLY": "hi everyone this is Christina with Aikido Bandidos and I'm going to be showing you how to make these easy three ingredient keto peanut butter cups so first you will start off by putting 1 cup of Lilly sugar-free milk chocolate chips into a microwave-safe Bowl and then you're gonna add 3 tablespoons of coconut oil into the bowl and microwave it for 2 minutes for 30 seconds at a time so this recipe is going to be good for 12 min iike cake wrappers [Music] then you're gonna take a half a tablespoon of the chocolate and pour into the mini cupcake wrappers that are double lined so the wrappers stay up and then you're going to stick them in the freezer for 20 minutes to set after they're set remove them from the freezer and add a teaspoon of peanut butter to the top of each one and then after that you're going to add a half a tablespoon of chocolate [Music] stick them back in the freezer for one hour and here's your final product [Music] if you enjoyed this quick and easy recipe please hit that like button and subscribe to our channel for more you", "z5AkiJphqFQ": "[Music] hey y'all welcome back to my channel in today's video i have a treat for you these are actually reese's peanut butter fat bombs do i think that you actually need fat bombs in your diet on the ketogenic diet no not really especially if you're trying to lose weight however if you're looking for a healthy dessert that's super simple and only takes five ingredients then definitely stay tuned to this recipe so the first thing you're gonna add is three tablespoons of coconut oil you could use kerrygold grass-fed butter as well doesn't matter which one but you're gonna melt that in the microwave but you don't wanna get it too too hot because we're also going to be adding one-third cup of chocolate chips i use the semi-sweet lilies you can use whatever sugar-free chocolate chips you prefer then we're also going to be adding peanut butter so that is 1 3 cup of peanut butter you want to use peanut butter that is natural peanut butter basically that just says in the ingredients peanuts and maybe some salt that's it you don't want all that other nasty ingredients in there we're really trying to keep this fat bomb pretty darn clean and maybe you want to treat it as a dessert or maybe you want to get your fats up one day either way this is a clean delicious way to do it that was one teaspoon of vanilla and then we're gonna add in there two teaspoons of powdered sugar you can adjust the sweetener as needed if you would like we are just going to stir that up really well make sure it's all incorporated nicely together and as you see the chocolate chips did not melt so i waited till that coconut oil was still liquidy but not warm enough to melt the chocolate chips and then i just took six silicone cupcake liners and lined them with my cupcake pan this mixture will fill six of those cupcake liners about halfway and once you're done with that we are going to freeze those but how good do those look you guys i'm telling you it tastes like a reese's so we are gonna put these babies in the freezer we're gonna freeze them for around an hour you can do it longer obviously but just make sure it's a level spot in your freezer when they come out they are perfect you can eat them right out of the freezer you can leave them in the freezer you can put them in the fridge afterwards i like them in the fridge afterwards but look at the chocolate chips in there you guys

bomb literally a fat bomb like always i'm praying for you your family and your country stay safe out there thank you so much for watching i greatly appreciate every single one of you guys and don't forget to go out there and make today even better than yesterday and i'll talk to you in my next video bye [Music] i won't look back when you're [Music]", "DwlG5qxeMBY": "hey everybody welcome back to mamazi's texas kitchen today we are making reese's peanut butter cup cookies i hope you will enjoy this video be sure and give me a thumbs up like share subscribe all those fun things let's get busy on today's video okay so what you're going to do to make these decollete little cookies is you need a stick and a half of butter now these um are half stick butters so it's going to take three of them and i uh softened them back in the microwave a little bit because i always forget to lay them out in time and i've got a third of a cup three-fourths of a cup of white sugar and then you're gonna put in three-fourths of a cup of brown sugar and you're going to cream this together [Music] and then you're going to add one egg at a time okay now i'm going to add my vanilla need a teaspoon of vanilla unfortunately the vanilla that i have making is not ready yet so i'm still using my store-bought vanilla that's okay because i've got a lot of it to use about it oh so club okay get this mixed in okay to get some of this off my beaters now we're going to start mixing in our dry ingredients wipe some of this off your sides again if you have like a kitchenaid a stand-up mixer make this a lot easier but i don't i'm going to start doing more holiday themed recipes because uh well we're almost to the holidays and you know we all have a lot that we can celebrate i'm adding in a two and a fourth cups of flour this is just a whole wheat all-purpose flour and i'm just using this because this is what i had on hand and that's another reason i'm kind of shifting it kind of getting some of the bigger chunks out but i had a lot of flour that i had bought up during the craziness and you know i just i'm not gonna buy more flour so there it is i need i'm adding some baking soda this well mixed and then we're gonna add all the fun stuff okay so i probably should have added this step before i added my flour but you know the joys of doing a cooking a cooking channel you can't always go back and do retakes but it's it'll turn out fine so i'm not real worried you need a half a cup of peanut butter now the recipe original recipe called for um creamy i'm adding crunchy because you know being nuts i like a little crunch if it was completely up to me i would be adding pecans to this too but i got outvoted by my family so because they're like mom you can't add nuts to everything so i'm sneaking them in don't tell anybody that's me being rebellious because my god i want some nuts in my cookies all right so we're going to mix the peanut butter in now set this over here let's add in all the good stuff first we're gonna add in a cup a cup of chocolate chips give or take okay we're gonna fold those in and that would be good enough if we just had chocolate chips in there but oh no we're adding more reese's minis we're going to take [Applause] about a cup give or take guys can i just say my family i'm like stop eating these guys that's why i bought two bags because i knew that they were gonna go crazy this is definitely my family's favorite candy might included i was going to pick a candy it would definitely be reese's i'll have to look at the statistic but i would be willing to venture or y'all saying this okay i'd be willing to venture that reese's is probably up there as one of the top candies in the world and you just cut them in half and these are already unwrapped so you don't have to sit and unwrap a cajillion mini reese's you just have to cut them in half so i'm going to finish these up and then we'll be right back a little piece of parchment paper here kind of the end of this roll got to get another one out but we're going to take our little here so all right we're going to put it in the oven and bake it for 8 to 12 minutes okay my friends if you want a super rich amazing little cookie i encourage you to try this recipe they're really good we've already tried one and it was it was really good reese's peanut butter cookies your family is gonna love

doesn't cause you guys a penny got sarah here follow her on instagram and snap snapchat everything is is it is not a snapshot it's everywhere instagram and youtube sarah ranak that's s-a-r-a-r-e-j-n-o boom so you guys have asked for it and we're responding so basically some people said that they would like to see the reese's versus quest and that's what we got right here guys it's what we got you asked for it we deliver you know what i'm saying so probably asking yourself what are the main differences between quests and reasons well i'm gonna tell you the macro differences here so reese's is coming in at um well first of all the package is 42 grams per package and that's the same for the quest um 12 grams of fat in the reese's and 15 grams of fat in the quest so actually the quest has three more grams of fat but the carbs is where the the carbs go pretty high on the reese's so 24 grams and only two fiber and 22 grams of sugar right and then only five grams of protein so quest is delivering 13 carbs with four grams of fiber and eight grams erythritol and less than one gram of sugar so everything you're tasting on the quest is literally a really foot tall or some kind of other sugar sweetener but it's not sugar because it has less than one gram of sugar so then there's and then there's 11 grams of protein so the question and the quest one so i mean speaking from the macros the main difference really here is there's lower carbs in the quest a little bit higher in the protein but the fat is a little bit higher in the quest um and then the fiber difference is only two grams and then the 22 grams of sugar is a big difference 22 grams of first is one pretty huge difference there um so how do you want to do this exactly you want to do one cup versus the other and then kind of compare them or do like i mean so we're going to bite half a bite half into one and then bite half in the other and kind of probably do like a difference because i mean these cups are very small by the way we're going to do the they're going to do the same size on the cups i mean it's 42 grams so they have to be the same size technically excuse me or wait speaking so this one is the reese's and this one is the quest quest reese's by the way this is more of like a dark chocolate look this one's more of a milk chocolate look so i think that's one of the main differences that i can tell from right from the start 100 super same kind of like look though very very similar other than the color difference they're very similar all right so let me give you both thank you and i got one reese's and i got one quest all right so what do you think quest first reese's first please probably reese's first yeah so if i don't bite into it do a half half a bite ready one two three sugar mmm sugar reese's always has that smacking taste of the peanut butter super sweet peanut butter i freaking love reese's all right i'm gonna wash my palette i'm going for the quest action quest here we go okay so i think the reason is peanut butter is softer well crush has a thicker chocolate and it's a little harder whereas reese's is just yeah kind of like if you look at the butter you can tell that the the quest is a little bit thicker than the reese's just ever so slightly i'll go back to the reese's yep reese's is softer the peanut butter peanut butter obviously sweeter 22 grams of sugar ain't gonna lie on that one so what are the main differences here the chocolate is thicker on the quest yep the reese's has more of a milk chocolate taste too reese's is going to be a lot more sweeter because of all that sugar so it best be sweet but honestly besides you know the milk chocolate taste and how hard the chocolate is in the quest it's kind of to me at least kind of not that like a big deal and if that makes sense 100 so like it's a difference but taste wise like quest is definitely keeping it up especially with lesson one gram of sugar definitely keeping up not that far behind at all in my opinion so the main difference is for me the reese's is softer sweeter it's softer and sweeter that's really the main difference um like she said for having less than one gram of sugar versus 22 grams of sugar and twice the amount of protein i think they did a very good job at keeping up um do you think it's worth it 100 oh my lord 100 is worth him you haven't even finished all of them yet because i'm trying to enjoy it because this is these are the last bits i have so else can we do this comparison price point price point is like a dollar for a reseason like two dollars for the quest so it's almost twice the amount actually i'd say it is twice the amount but that's that's the other thing is twice the amount of money quest has protein protein is more expensive than you know all the sugars and bogusness that is in candies and such so it makes sense i mean i'm not gonna lie obviously the reese's tastes better than me obviously right i mean i honestly love the quest like the quest reese's is not better than quest i mean quest is not better than reese's i mean you really think so i wouldn't say better but they are on the same i think they're keeping up around the scene keeping up for sure but i would never say that the quest is better than reasons that's for damn sure that's just my parents personal opinion obviously i have a reese's fan for since childhood right so but i'm gonna call a spade a spade quest is definitely keeping up with reese's on this one i think they're in the same playing field and i think if you don't want to totally throw away your macros maybe you know trying to be more macro friendly then quest is the way to go absolutely definitely kill your sweet tooth 100 this is one of the few goodies that like that actually would do it would do it now because like in in that term like same playing field i absolutely love it man i love it you heard the lady she loves it so anything else we could say about this comparison video i don't think so like like i said like it's not the same playing field you can't go wrong you can't go wrong i like i said in the the quest video i think you should absolutely try it out and um if you're a big reese's fan obviously try it out and hey why don't you do the same thing do the taste test difference buy a package of bees try it out for yourself and see if you can tell the main differences and whether it's worth it to buy it in the future that way you know whether you should buy quests in the future for you know peanut butter cups or things that you're you know got sweet tooth kind of cravings and maybe it's not worth it maybe you don't think it's worth it maybe you don't think the price is worth it maybe you don't think the macros are worth it at the end of the day i think it it might be worth it for sure um i think it's kind of similar like buying name brands and then buying like off buying off brands yeah like they're kind of the same and you can barely like most of the time most of the differences yeah so that's our final thoughts i hope you guys enjoyed this video thanks for the support as always follow me on all my social media it will be in the description box below give it a thumbs up it really helps the channel out and it doesn't cost you guys a  penny and um hope you guys enjoyed this video follow sarah it'll be in the description another

It looks like\nthere\u00b4s a steam leak. That\u00b4s all I can think of. The plot is that they have\nto fix a leak -- a leaky pipe. -How did you know?\n-That\u00b4s the plot. -The plumber, yeah.\n-It\u00b4s the plumber, yeah. -I\u00b4m the plumber.\nJustice Plumbers. -I have that, I have that.\nYeah, it\u00b4s all about plumbing.

So Christmas,\neveryone buys presents, and then Halloween,\neveryone\u00b4s got to do candies and buy tons of candy,\nand then it\u00b4s okay for you to tell to your children\nto go knock on strangers\u00b4 doors so they can give them candies.\n[ Laughter ] And last year,\nAlma was like, \"This is the best holiday ever!\" -Of course!\nKids love it! -She loves it.\nThere\u00b4s nothing not to love about it.\n-Well, we were talking about candies and\nwhat candies you like and you told me about this candy\nI\u00b4ve never heard of. -Oh, you\u00b4ve got it.\nThe Shokolad Parah. -Yeah, I was going\nto say that.

"what is up guys welcome back to the channel welcome back to my kitchen ever since i dropped the oral mcflurry video the amount of tags i got on instagram with that one crazy but i'm glad you guys like it keep tagging me on there man i love to see you guys getting in the kitchen and getting anabolic and since you guys loved that one so much i thought hmm what's the next logical thing to make

with chunks of reese's peanut butter cups and you got to get the extra stuff in there i don't care what it costs bud double up them toppings but by the time you eat your meal and then you eat that

if you guys are ready to get another epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] quick update for you guys woke up this morning at a new low weight again every single week i've been eating 2 500 calories a day on this diet i'm waking up a week later having dropped another pound i've never had a diet this effortless let me just show you man all right no pump no nothing just chilling right how are we looking that's with eating me flurries eating pizza eating blizzards eating really whatever i want man eating chicken rice and broccoli never got me like this man i was ever this full of energy that's happy it's anything so anabolic diet 10 out of 10. step one grab your food scale you should definitely have one of these already unless you're new to the channel and if you're new around here pause the video go to amazon and buy one at six bucks you're gonna need it and you're also gonna need your blender pitcher what do you even call this thing i don't know what it is but it's what you put your stuff in for the blender you need that you're gonna sit this on here we're gonna weigh things out this way first ingredient we're gonna throw in the blender is 32 grams of whey protein as always i'm using that final boss cinnamon toast swirl but no matter what flavor you use is gonna be good man vanilla i think will probably look the prettiest but throw chocolate in there bud there's no rules in here just don't use a vegan protein it won't work vines will start growing out of this blender you don't want that next up we toss in 85 grams of plain greek yogurt it's gonna add some protein and honestly i think it does wonders for the texture of this man makes it more creamy now we just add in 65 grams of unsweetened almond milk vanilla flavor preferably this stuff is great the only milk you ever need quit buying a regular stuff start buying this you're gonna be way better off now we're gonna add in 60 grams of pb fit powder basically they just take peanut butter all the goodness that is peanut butter and zap the fat calories out of it so you're left with the protein and the fiber wish someone would do that to me just zap all the fat off leave you with the good stuff now in order to make this more creamy add some nice flavor we're gonna add in seven grams of sugar-free vanilla pudding mix once again you can use chocolate if you want really whatever flavor you'd like but for this recipe make sure it's the sugar-free version so we can save those calories man now we're just gonna put in five grams of a zero calorie sweetener i get it at walmart i get it cheap don't be scared of these sweeteners man i really haven't had any bad side effects since i started using them so much other than the hair on my arms hasn't grown in two months who needs that anyways and now we just need three grams of xanthan gum this is really the secret ingredient some of these ones you could probably get away with not using but xanthan gum is the necessity you find in the baking island you buy it once it's gonna last you forever and the final thing we gotta do is get our reese's filling as you can see we got a box of reese's puffs here we're doing this because we want that flavor we want that chocolate we want that peanut butter but we don't want all the calories from throwing regular reese's cups in here you're gonna get way more volume this way you're gonna lock that flavor in guys you gotta trust me so go in in a separate bowl and weigh out 39 grams of our reese's puffs cereal see look at this man you get quite a bit for that huh not too shabby [Music] now we're just gonna throw them in a baggie grab a tool of bludgeoning ice cream scoop and start hammering away and once they're broken up just transfer them back to your bowl now just put about three quarters of them down here in your blender because we want to save the other quarter for the top bin and to be honest you can skip this entire step if you don't want a topping you can just blend it all in here and it's gonna be really good regardless but if you're taking instagram photos you better add that topping you better do it if you're tagging me [Music] and the final step we just need to add a little ice i talked about this watch this about this much will do now we're going to take our blender slap the good old hat on her lock it into our blender now all we got to do is blend her for a few minutes and she gonna be right she gonna be right let's go [Music] logan gets terrified every time i fire this thing up such a precious woe guy practically almost done all i'm going to do here is go ahead and scrape the sides of this thing and sometimes that pv fit likes to stay on there you just want to make sure everything's mixing together man i mean you don't got to do this you don't have to but we are making a video so i might as well once your sides are scraped you really just need about a minute or two longer and this guy's gonna be done let's go and boom reese's peanut butter cup blizzard is officially done now all i'm gonna do is transfer to this cup cause i gotta get a good thumbnail but the real question is is she gonna beat out the oreo mcflurry that's what i'm gonna ask you guys once you try this one out and if you've had the oreo mcflurry i want you to be honest and comment below which one you like better and make sure if you make this one find me on instagram baby i want to see it and then once we got her filled up what we're gonna do is just take the rest of our toppings and sprinkle them right on the top ain't she beautiful bud if

ingredient brands that we will be using [Music] now we will begin to mix our ingredients together starting off with our two unsalted stick butters [Music] now that your butter is melted it's better to do this procedure as quickly as possible that way it will not ruin the texture of your dough later on moving on to our dry ingredients we are going to be adding 2 and 1/4 cups of flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda along with a teaspoon of salt and we're going to mix all of that together and now we are going to combine our wet ingredients with our dry ingredients and make sure to mix that well until it forms a nice creamy dough just like this now we are going to cover this and let this sit in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes while we let our dough refrigerate we're going to unwrap these Reese's peanut butter cups just to help prepare to make our cookies [Music] about 15 to 20 minutes later your dog should have set just like this and now we can start rolling them into golf sized balls just like this and now while we're doing that we are going to preheat our oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit now that we have done most of the prep work you'll begin to put together our cookies and now we are going to grab a ball of dough and press firmly in the middle to make sure our Reese's Peanut Butter Cup can fit perfectly right in the middle press also firmly on that without trying to break the chocolate and now you place that into your cupcake tray and it goes all the same with all of your other cookies now we will set our cookies in the oven and let that bake for 10 to 12 minutes and watch carefully to make sure you don't overcook them and here's your final product [Music] thank you for watching this video on mother and daughter cooking and we'll see you next time in our next video

home Reese's peanut butter cups are very simple and easy to make and only a handful of ingredients to make these and I promise you that once you try these ones today you'll never want another store-bought racist hamburger code trust me on that so let's get started and look make Reese's Peanut Butter okay so we're going to make the filling first which is just three ingredients you'll need some softened butter I'm going to mix that first I wanted to become really creamy then I'm going to add the peanut butter which should be at room temperature as well try to use good quality peanut butter these are peanut butter cups guys that's the main ingredient that's where you're going to taste and lastly you're going to add some powdered sugar I'm just going to mix that in with my spatula first so it doesn't go everywhere and then I'm going to continue with my mixer okay so once you got your lovely cream you're going to set that aside and we're basically almost done so you're just going to melt some chocolate you can use whatever chocolate you want I'm going to use milk chocolate because I want to make the original peanut butter cups and you'll also need some cupcake liners you don't need a cupcake tray to make these there's a lot of recipes out there that say you need the tray you don't need the tray especially if you don't have it don't go out and buy guys just get some paper liners and you'll be fine so you're going to put some of that chocolate on the bottom of your cups once that has hardened you're going to fill it with your peanut butter cream now you want to put it just in the center don't go all the way to the sides or we'll show in the final product here I was just using some water to smooth down the cream so when we put the chocolate on top it's going to be nice and smooth go ahead and put the remaining on chocolate on top and be sure to top it down to release any air bubbles and once again to get a nice smooth top put these in the fridge for 5-10 minutes to set and they're done these days exactly like the real thing I gifted these to a friends he said they were fabulous they were gone with him like half an hour guys um as you saw they take like 15 minutes to make from start to finish so they're really simple but you know if you're craving them and you have some chocolate and peanut butter on hands you don't have to go out and buy these

welcome to watchmojo.com and today we'll be showing you how to make peanut butter cups right at home for this recipe you'll need two cups of milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips two tablespoons of shortening half a cup of butter 1/2 a cup of crunchy peanut butter one cup of confectioner's sugar and two thirds of a cup graham cracker crumbs in a medium saucepan combine the peanut butter and butter and cook that over medium heat until it's completely melted now mixing the confectioner sugar and graham cracker crumbs leave your peanut butter mixture to cool while you prepare your workspace place mini cupcake papers on a cookie sheet and set that aside next in the top of a double boiler melt the chocolate and shortening until the mixture is smooth now cover the bottom of your papers with a layer of the melted chocolate take your peanut butter filling and form it into small balls and place each of those in a cupcake paper then take your chocolate and cover each of those balls with more chocolate you may be tempted to fill your papers completely with chocolate to the top but I find that makes it way harder to get them out later so make sure you leave a little space now place your candies in the freezer until you're ready to serve feel free to use creamy peanut butter if you prefer a smooth flavor either way these will be sure to please your sweet tooth", "2QRvy1p-dnA": "hey guys welcome to Christina cakes it I'm Christina and today I'm making a Reese's no-bake peanut butter cup cheesecake [Music] [Applause] I'm very excited to share this recipe with you guys because this cheesecake is actually for Matt husband's really good friend I've been trying to bake for him for well over a year but he tells me he doesn't really eat sugar but he finally made a request and he requested a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake I decided to do a no bake cheesecake because honestly it's so easy and this recipe is foolproof and I just really think that you guys are gonna like it so to get started we are going to prepare the crust so our cheesecake crust is really simple it is 35 crushed Oreos or really just like an entire thing of Oreos you can use the food processor or you can do it like me and I put them in a bag and I crush them with a rolling pin and six tablespoons of melted butter so I'm just gonna start by mixing my cookie crumbs and my melted butter together and you could use graham cracker crumbs or honestly really any cookie crumbs that you'd like but I thought the Oreo would be nice because it would give more of a chocolate flavor to complement the peanut butter [Music] here I have my 9-inch springform pan and I have completely buttered this whole thing because I want the Cheesecake to come out easily whenever we're finally done with it so I'm just gonna Pat down this cookie crust and I really want to pack this in there and the tighter the crust is the less likely it is to fall apart when we're cutting into it [Music] I'm gonna stick this into the freezer while I prepare the filling so we have half a cup of cold whipping cream two teaspoons of granulated sugar half a cup of sour cream two blocks of cream cheese or 16 ounces one cup of powdered sugar one and a half cups of creamy peanut butter so almost a full jar and one cup of chopped up and Reese's peanut butter cups so the first step of this is we're going to beat our heavy whipping cream we're basically gonna make whipped cream so we're gonna beat this until it's stiff peaks so this is gonna be like three or four minutes and as I'm beating this I'm gonna add my two teaspoons of sugar [Music] so now we have our whipped cream looking great and we're going to set this aside for later so that took about three minutes in total so now I'm gonna add my cream cheese and the peanut butter and we're just gonna whip this together next we're gonna add in this sour cream and our powdered sugar we're gonna tell our friend though there's no sugar in here where's now pretend and now we're gonna take our lip cream and carefully fold it in we don't want to mix this with the mixer because we don't want to lose the volume of the lip cream like we don't want to like deflate it so I'm just taking a rubber spatula and I'm folding this in and lastly for our filling we're going to fold in our peanut butter cups it's the best part so I've gotten my crust out of the freezer it's been in there for maybe 20 minutes or so and I'm just gonna pour this filling into our crust [Music] and I'm just gonna smooth this out so now that my filling is in my springform pan the next part is really important we need this to set and used to go on the fridge for at least four hours but you could actually leave it up to two days so I'm probably gonna leave this overnight and finish this tomorrow but the important thing is it just really needs that time to firm up so that it will keep its shape so for the toffee we have 1 cup of warm heavy cream that I warmed up in the microwave we have 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and we have some Reese's peanut butter cups so we're gonna chop up for garnish so our cheesecakes me on the fridge for quite a while so it's ready to make the ganache topping that we're going to cover the entire filling with so I have my chocolate chips and I have my warm heavy cream and this I'm warming to the microwave for about 1 minute and I'm just going to pour this over my chocolate chips and this is a one to one ratio so 1 cup chocolate chips 1 cup heavy whipping cream and we want this to sit for a couple minutes before we start stirring it so this has been sitting for maybe five minutes and I'm just going to stir this until it's smooth so it's gonna feel like it's not coming together but it's totally [Music] and now that this is nice and smooth I'm gonna let it sit for another 10 or 15 minutes before I pour it onto our cheesecake so my ganache has been sitting for about 10 or 15 minutes and I'm just gonna put it on my set cheesecake and smooth it out and now I'm just gonna start placing some of my races onto the cheesecake so this is gonna go back into the fridge for at least an hour so that my ganache will set and then from there we are able to open our pan and cut our cheesecake all right so I'm back and my cheesecake is out of the fridge and I ended up letting mind set overnight because the longer that it chills the firmer that it's gonna be so I'm just gonna pop this out of my springform pan and we're gonna see how it turned out [Music] [Music] all right so this cheesecake could not look any better I mean seriously anything with chocolate and peanut butter is guaranteed to be like absolutely delicious so I hope that you guys enjoyed learning this really easy super simple and no-bake cheesecake

sugar take on this tasty treat and by the way it's packed with healthy fats too is fitness and transformation expert thomas de lauer welcome back man hey thanks for having me absolutely this is a great snack for people i talk about it all the time trying to reduce sugar and wherever we can increase healthy fats and i know this recipe is kind of special for you it's very special for me because i was 300 pounds before when i was in a corporate setting corporate health care and honestly my favorite candy was a peanut butter cup there you go that's just what i would eat all the time when i was close to 300 pounds lost all that weight kept it off look at him look at the transformation there this guy knows he walks the walk uh that is for sure so that you came up with a way that you can still enjoy this exactly so i adopted a lower carb lifestyle and i realized that i could make something that still satisfies that sweet tooth still gives me everything that i wanted out of that but without all the sugar so i can keep my weight off i can feel good about it and i can have some fun in the kitchen in the meantime everybody at home right now is saying that like this is speaking cameras like i'm so happy hearing all this this is great now he obviously takes it to the next level we start we start when i say we i mean you uh making your own nut butter so take us to why you want to do that versus just using peanut butter and then what you got going on in order to make that yeah totally so the whole goal here is we want to be using fats that are rich in omega-3s heart-healthy fats right okay the omega-6 is lower so what i have here is actually a mix of a bunch of different nuts but the predominant nut is macadamia nuts okay macadamia nuts they're my jam yeah obviously they're yours too so basically what we'll do here is you can use your own kind of blend of nuts but i don't like using peanuts because peanuts are really high in omega-6s yeah it's not that peanut butter is bad i mean peanut butter is fine if you get the ones without the sugar in it but if we're really trying to level up the fats we want to have good omega-3 profiles and that's why we take what we call a mediterranean spin on this so this is like a mediterranean uh candy cup kind of thing which brings us into our next ingredient that goes into this we have tahini tahini which you wouldn't think of it in like a cup like this right exactly so how does so what does that bring to this nut butter it makes it a little bit creamy what does it do yeah so tahini is made from toasted sesame seeds right that doesn't sound like something you would put in a candy normally but toasted sesame seeds have a very very rich antioxidant profile so that is really what we're after here so whenever we're having any kind of fats coming in the body we want to make sure that we're loading up with antioxidants too which we're going to get in the chocolate in a minute too and then this is something that's really wild i call this peanut butter or the tropics okay it's coconut butter which is so wild it's amazing i just learned about this a couple years ago before i used to make this recipe without this and this just took it to another level okay you get that guy in there too and then you've got some great flavors that you're going to add as well when you're ready what do you have out there in front just a little bit of cinnamon here a little bit of cinnamon okay give it a little nice cinnamon puff it's perfect for fall as well you have to do some salt flakes you can use sea salt you can use pink himalayan salt okay good beautiful and then you want to use a little bit of vanilla you can use liquid vanilla extract too that's really what's going to give it that well-rounded flavor that we want okay so we blend that all up i mean there it is everybody it's so packed i mean i just want to point out the fact also looking at thomas people think i'm gonna go on keto diet or i'm gonna go low carb but i'm gonna lose my muscle this guy's arms are like he can't find a shirt that fits his biceps okay good now we've got our mold here this is where we're gonna actually make the um well i'll call a peanut butter cup for lack of a better word um so how do we do this man okay so we have unsweetened okay baking chocolate okay so i don't want you uh you know going and picking up like regular sugar loaded chocolate okay unsweetened baking chocolate and then you're gonna add a little stevia a good uh low calorie sweetener what else could we use if we weren't going to use uh you could use monk fruits okay uh you could you know you could use something like coconut sugar if you wanted to make it uh not super low carb but with a better choice of carbohydrate there okay very good so those are some options there everybody um and now we have this in a little piping bag this is obviously the uh homemade nut butter if you weren't gonna make your own nut butter what would you recommend if you weren't gonna make it yeah i would say go ahead and use coconut butter so which is again not coconut oil not to be mistaken with that butter coconut butter tahini and that's a great blend by itself okay otherwise you can find macadamia nut butter and if you're really just trying to get something a little bit more easy to find you could go with simple almond butter there you go yep awesome those are great swap outs here so we've got our chocolate melted down a little double boiler to do that probably right and then we use a spoon just to fill them up look at this everybody do you think i am excited right now uh the answer is a big yes even though i'm making a big mess is this going to say don't worry about making a mess it happens yeah it happens it's all fine now listen man i know you spoke about the mediterranean diet earlier and i know you got a cookbook the new mediterranean diet that's coming out tell us about what you mean by the new mediterranean diet because that's something that a lot of people are super familiar with especially my lovely co-host debbie matanopoulos so what about the new yeah so the new mediterranean diet is all about leveraging all the science that we know surrounding lower carb diets okay but intertwining it along with mediterranean principles so the mediterranean diet is amazing okay good healthy fats good healthy fibers it's largely known as probably one of the healthiest diets out there in the world but then we look at the popularity of the low-carb diet and people tend to think oh i don't want all those saturated fats i don't want all those trans fats so that's what it is so you're looking at all the ways that you can get healthier fats keeping it low carb in a tasty way right for the mediterranean diet i'm sorry did you say something i'm just i'm gonna stop talking i'm gonna stop talking to everybody thomas that was so good you're amazing he's he's appreciating his own work over there that makes me so happy man it's so good to see you i'm a big fan of this guy right here find this recipe at hallmarkchannel.com and check out more from thomas on his website which is right there below thanks", "FlZfikp_0nk": "chocolate

is mix all the dry ingredients together so we've got one scoop of protein powder two tablespoons of sweetener which is stevia base and a half a teaspoon of Himalayan pink salt the next thing that I do is I the peanut butter I've just heated it gently on a low setting in the microwave and then I'm just going to mix that until it becomes like a crumbly peanut butter protein dough so after it's a derp I'm going to grab my table spoon and put the dough in there so I can form that into circular shapes that are smaller than the actual mold I'm going to grab that the dark chocolate which I've just melted on a low heat fill the mold halfway through I'm going to grab my dough with that in the middle and then I'm just trying to put the dark chocolate on top and cover it up so this is the finished

"P8KKDAEux_Q": "howdy folks and welcome to the hillbilly kitchen today we're going to be making peanut butter cups now basically for peanut butter cups unique peanut butter and you need some butter and I have one cup of peanut butter and a quarter of a cup of butter it's four tablespoons and you have to have some powdered sugar and I've got a cup plus a little bit more because you're going to add the powdered sugar until you get it to the right consistency now I have seen a lot of recipes for this where they use up to three cups of powdered sugar for each cup of peanut butter you do not want to do that because if you do your peanut butter cups are not going to taste very much like peanut butter they're just gonna taste sugary the powdered sugar really doesn't have any flavor it's just to stiffen up your peanut butter and your peanut butter cups now I'm gonna dip my peanut butter in some dark chocolate and these are just um dark chocolate candy pieces that are made to melt and coat candy and I'm gonna make some milk chocolate and dip some of them in milk chocolate and to do that you need a half a cup of milk chocolate chips and a half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and about a tablespoon of coconut oil or shortening and what the coconut oil or the shortening and I like the coconut oil it doesn't I think it tastes better in the candy coating and it's also a little healthier than shortening but what that does is it makes your chocolate shiny now I've also got some white chocolate pieces over here that I have already melted because I've been making other candy it's Valentine's Day and I want to dress some of these up a little bit just by drizzling some of that white chocolate across the top now that's definitely optional you don't have to do that and you can do just one kind of dip either the dark chocolate or the milk chocolate just whatever you want but I wanted to give you a few options and this is fairly simple I'm going to start by dumping in my one cup of powdered sugar that'll kind of keep my peanut butter from all sticking in the bottom and then I'm going to add my peanut butter and this by the way is no cooking no bake it's a very simple recipe for candy that isn't very hard to mess up I'm gonna add my butter you can use a mixer to mix this but when you're mixing powdered sugar you run a very high risk of making a mess before you start mixing it let's go ahead and dump this chocolate in here we're going to be melting together and get rid of some of this stuff oh I almost forgot you want a teaspoon of vanilla in this too and you do want about a teaspoon of vanilla for every cup of peanut butter I think I'm gonna go ahead and this other third of a cup of powdered sugar because I want my peanut butter feeling a little bit thicker than what it is but I would not add any more than the cup and 1/3 per cup of peanut butter because you'll just dilute your peanut butter too much it looks real good now if you just want to do peanut butter balls out of this and get the peanut butter balls and then sit them out on wax paper you're going to need to put this in the refrigerator for at least an hour but because I'm going to put it in these cute little candy cups I'm gonna try to do it without refrigerate it but what putting it in the refrigerator does is it really stiffens up your peanut butter and your butter so that you can hang on to it while you're dipping it down in the chocolate hands when you're making candy you want to make sure you have a roll of paper towels ready to go because you're going to get it all over your hands and it gets so bad that you really can't do anything until you clean your hands off I'm just going to use a cookie scooper to scoop this out and I am going to take my spoon and kind of level this off and mash it down in the cookie scoop we're good because I want these to be pretty firm and pretty even and you can see with that cup and a third of on powdered sugar this is plenty stiff enough and my butter was super soft it's been at room temperature all day of course having really soft butter it makes it really easy to mix too so you do want to leave your butter sitting out before you start mixing this oh and I forgot I put down some wax paper here to work on wax paper is also a must when you're making candy because it keeps the whole area much cleaner when you start dipping the stuff in chocolate you're going to get it everywhere so put down the wax paper it'll save you a ton of time cleaning it up and this dough would be much easier to work with if I had to put it in the refrigerator for about an hour and you'll definitely want to do that but we have been really working like crazy trying to get all of these candy videos up before Valentine's Day and when I have to do a cut to put something in the oven to bake or put something in the fridge it adds about an hour to the editing process and for bread edits all of our videos so he's gonna have to edit about two videos a day between now and Valentine's Day to get them all up I think I have six waiting for him to edit samantha has three and she's working on another one and I've got at least two more that I have to do so for his sake I'm gonna work with my soft peanut butter though but you will definitely not put this in the fridge like I said for about an hour it'll make it easier to dip and even make it easier to form into these Falls alright now the next step is to melt our chocolate so we're gonna start with our dark chocolate and I'm going to put this in for about a minute because it takes dark-chocolate a little bit longer to melt than it does milk chocolate and if you just start with 30 seconds the dark chocolate hasn't even really started them out yet bring all of our chocolate over here so we're getting start melting it just add the coconut into our milk chocolate semi-sweet chocolate there our milk chocolate in and we'll start it at 30 seconds so that's not gonna do a whole lot but it is gonna melt that coconut oil and I want to get that down in the chocolate so it's not sitting on top fall it all melts I'm just gonna put this dark chocolate in for about another 20 seconds I don't want to get my chocolate really really hot because my peanut butter balls are soft I haven't put them in a refrigerator you will probably if you have refrigerated yours want to go at least another 30 seconds so that it stays hot long enough to dip all of your peanut butter balls in now I obviously have more peanut butter balls and I have little cups and that's okay I'm just using my muffin pan to hold it together until the chocolate starts to cool a little bit I don't have to leave it in there until the chocolate completely sets and then I can take out the ones I've done and I can put some more little candy cups in there and make the rest of my Ricci cups all you're gonna do is you're gonna drop your peanut butter ball down in the chocolate and then I'm going to take a work and get this out I'm gonna learn a little bit drift and just slide it in one of my little q-tips that's all there is to it I'm gonna do half of them and milk chocolate and half of them in a dark chocolate and my milk chocolate is actually a little bit cooler than my dark chocolate so I'm gonna get both fat half first as I'm doing these the flat part that was being on the top of the cookie scooper when I leveled it off I'm trying to turn them so that that part is in the bottom of my little baking cup so the top will kind of be rounded I just think it's prettier that way it really doesn't matter it does fit in the baking cut better that way so you get more even chocolate and stuff I said this would be much much easier if these had been put in the refrigerator because they're so soft and when I drop these in here I'm dropping them in with a rounded side down and then kind of rolling them over in the chocolate that way if the bottom doesn't get coated it doesn't affect the way it looks the top is all coated real nice and even okay now at this point you have a peanut butter cup but because I'm doing these for Valentine's Day I'm gonna take my white bacon pieces that I melted and just drizzle a little bit across the top of them to make a prettier and you can do this if you're doing them for Christmas too or if you're giving them away for sure it just makes them prettier and it doesn't change the taste that much the white bacon pieces actually have kind of a vanilla taste and you know you're not putting enough on them to change the flavor but you just pick your spoon up like this so that the chocolate starts with dripping off and then just drizzle it across them and you don't need to worry about getting this on your pan because you're not baking it on there and it'll actually come right off you can just take your finger and rub it off once it gets cool see why you need the wax paper I've got chocolate everywhere and it actually does make your grizzle more even if you start off the edge and end off of the edge so I'm going to let these cool just a minute and then I'm gonna line my little pan with some new cups and I'm gonna do this again until I get all of my peanut butter dough covered in chocolate I probably won't grizzle all of them but I am going to drizzle some of them I do want to show you real quick though before in the video if you want to do them like peanut butter balls you just dip it the same way you don't have to have the baking cups and once you drip it off you slide it off on your wax paper just like that and when it's cooled it'll peel up off the wax paper so you don't need the cups they're just something extra for the holidays and you can get those cups for all occasions they make them for Christmas Easter they have birthday themes I hope you've enjoyed this video and I hope to try some homemade candies because there's a lot of candies that you don't even have to own a pot to cook and this is one of them you don't need to be intimidated by trying to get syrup to the right temperature there's lots and lots of things you can make without even worrying about that and when you do some stuff like this it's easier then try to stuff with a syrup fit you have to practice a lot far thanks for joining us again in the hillbilly kitchen don't forget to click like and subscribe before you leave and we'll see you next time", "gnGf1YF-58I": "you g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make three ingredient peanut butter cups these are so easy simple and quick to make super yummy let's go get a microwave-safe bowl and throw in about 120 grams of white chocolate then add half a cup of smooth or creamy peanut butter now just pop that in the microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds then give it a stir then turn it on for 20 seconds and give it a stir and just repeat that until it's smooth alright that's ready nice and smooth now I just put this aside and let it cool just a little bit while we do the next part get another microwave safe Bowl and throw in 350 grams of chocolate you can use milk chocolate dark chocolate semi-sweet chocolate I'm using half dark half milk pop that in the microwave for 30 seconds give it a stir repeat for 30 seconds give it a stir and keep doing that until it's melted but do not burn it get a mini muffin pan with little mini Dubey whackers here or you can use a larger one if you want I like to use little ones like this and get the melted chocolate and just pour just pour some of it in so we're basically putting the base in once you've done that add the filling to it yummy just pop these in the freezer for about five minutes or so just so this starts to slightly harden just a little bit and then we'll put the layer of chocolate on top now this is setting it's not as you can see it's not hard but it's staying to get firm get the chocolate and pour it straight over the top as high as you wish now just pop these in the freezer for about ten minutes or so and we're done and then you can eat until the end of time and beyond I hope you like these yummy yummy man hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal Oh", "C_demDDRYgQ": "yeah I know wait oh yeah hello everyone my name is Lisa and I'm Vivian vegan because I'm gay and I'm vegan a lot of you guys know that I'm allergic to nuts I'm allergic to tree nuts or like some of them basically wish to almonds hazelnuts cashews and macadamia nuts basically my four favorite nuts maybe I overdid it maybe a word to all nuts that I shouldn't be eating any nuts huh anyway I can eat peanuts I don't get any reaction from peanuts and which is a good thing because I've eaten a lot of peanuts in my life today we're gonna make vegan peanut butter cups this recipe is already on my blog and today I'm doubling it because I want to if I got to go through the trouble of making them I'm gonna make the double amount cuz normally just makes 12 so today I'm gonna make 24 I'm gonna be using these silicone rubber cup things actually not rubber because they're silicone silly you can just use paper ones if you want I use these silicone ones pretty much exclusively for peanut butter cups and we're gonna microwave these two together to make the first batch of cup things so I've got some coconut oil and I'm just going to put that in here with the chocolate chips and basically this just makes it a little bit easier to spin around and to work with so put that there microwave you 30-second intervals 30 seconds coconut oil has melted and I'm using a little stir Easter you could also use the double boiler method if you want to 30 seconds again chocolate oh yeah starting to get very melty actually I came over to stir this in tempering most of its melted and the other ones that aren't melted are just going to melt residually through the heat so this is lazy tempering of chocolate right smooth ribbons of chocolate oh my god what you do now is basically you put in about maybe a half teaspoon or a teaspoon of chocolate and you kind of just push it onto the sides to make a peanut butter cup like form this is the bottom layer do that 12 times once you've done all this you just kind of wrap it on the counter to get any air bubbles out look at all the air bubbles coming up jiggies you pick but I have a cake tester I'm just going to take all these little bubbles and pop them now you put it in the freezer now that those are in the freezer I'm gonna put together the filling so icing sugar graham cracker crumbs I found these at bulk barn they don't have any honey in them but you can also buy those like gluten-free ones I think they're like the s'more bulls I can't remember what they're called I think they taste like sawdust so I prefer these ones but you can get the gluten-free ones if that's something that is accessible to you so add this to this I know that my icing sugar has been sitting in my cupboard for a while so it's a little clumpy so I'm just going to take a whisk and whisk them together otherwise I'm gonna have clumpy times zombie times sort of sifted is what I call lazy sifting then you put in the peanut butter I have a feeling this is not a big enough bowl I'm gonna transfer it dry ingredients dusty cloud of sugar natural peanut butter this is just peanuts there's no other things there's no sweeteners so that's what you want goop no peanut butter left behind and then you add butter this is vegan butter about quarter cup like I said this is a doubled recipe from the one that I have on my site so you don't you only need half this amount for 12 peanut butter cups but I say if you're gonna make them just make 20 thin yeah mix it all together I know a lot of other recipes out there that just use the straight up nut butter I just find that doesn't hold up very well and like eating wise it's like too gooey and they need to be refrigerated these don't need to be refrigerated I like to because I like eating my chocolate cold because of how sturdy the filling is it's not gonna like run all over the place when you're trying to eat it give it a taste test for quality assurance those graham cracker crumbs are stale but it's fine you guys can't tell the filling is ready very sturdy when the crumbs aren't stale they're very reminiscent of recent paper cups so you grab your now set chocolate shells a spoon out what is this I want to say it's 1 tablespoon 2 teaspoons 2 teaspoons of filling per cup you don't need to use this you just use Teta so Scott would like this and then you just use your finger to smush it down mush mush mush mush mush mush mush Dada Dada Dada now you may be asking Lisa why didn't you do this for Halloween to be honest I didn't think about it but peanut butter cups are kind of like my childhood vice my mom and I would like split these all the time we'd buy one of those like king sized ones where there was a four of them two for me two for my mom we were a little obsessed with peanut butter but that's because peanut butter is delicious and if you are allergic to nuts you can use in that butter you can use pumpkin seed butter you can use tahini I've also used coconut butter or coconut mana before which is like the same sort of thing it's basically like blended up coconut meat coconut meat - coconut butter is the same as peanuts - peanut butter all jammed down with my finger now you cover them with more chocolate it's about a teaspoon of chocolate on top and then you just use a spoon so you're going to spread it to the edges and that's what it should look like you do that to the rest of them and then you freeze it actually if you want to be a little fancy you can sprinkle a little salt on look fleur de sel which is just like very light sea salt and you just kind of sprinkle a little bit on top for a little salty kick covered in chocolate gonna give him a little rappy rack over here and put them back in the freezer BRB okay well I finished doing the second layer so I'm going to swap it out I'm gonna take one of the ones with salt on them because delicious and all you have to do is pop it out we had a peanut butter cut mm-hmm oh yeah oh the salt all these are so good holy crap peanut butter cups I'm missing cuz I ate it and I want to keep eating it so I'm gonna end this video so I can eat more I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope that you make your own vegan

can hear that eventually oh yeah dammit I'm the worst oh my god I just put on my face huh I got really dark bumpy a breakup catch put it nice bye", "Avrt3ufrDg0": "so I wanted to come up with the absolute best very popular Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ice cream and it was hard it was very hard it's not in the book because it's relatively new luckily they sell Reese's Peanut Butter Cup pieces I guess that's what they don't say with their coat hmm yeah but they're not Reese's Pieces what they are is peanut butter cups that are like I guess they got caught in the machine or something I don't know they figured out a way to market it when I started with this I started buying the cups the Reese's peanut butter cups and using those but this certainly makes life easier however in coming up with a recipe and that's one thing that we'll spend a lot of time on in the next couple of days making recipes how do you make a recipe for ice cream in making this recipe I found that it lacked I couldn't get that punch of flavor just adding this to this so we had to we have to add some things if you think about Reese's peanut butter cups milk chocolate peanut butter and that's it that's all see that's all it is so so I have to add some stuff to it so the first thing I added was my go-to ingredient which is gia deli chocolate powder it's crushed chocolate it's actually just chocolate powder it's not cocoa it's chocolate powder and you can get it there's a company called serious chai calm and I I buy a lot of it I buy the 25 pound boxes of it and they're about 100 bucks but well worth it yeah I tried going to gia Delhi site and I couldn't find what yeah well I in the quantity I need it's cheaper to go someplace else to get it that's America so so that's the first thing I added was some good crushed chocolate and this is one of those six secret ingredients that really changes everything in your ice cream the next thing I wanted was more peanut butter taste so what do you add you add peanut butter and that's basically it so we're gonna add we're gonna use the mix some vanilla and the answer to why use the vanilla is why not the Reese's the peanut butter and the chocolate that's it it's not very complex but it's certainly more than the last one and I apologize for the last one forgetting a significant amount of Milky Way bars but oh well and you understand why you throw stuff like that away you know it's just you gotta you know you got to lead with your best shot and that wasn't my best shot when I made it you know if I would make that at the store that's not your best shot and my advice to you is don't worry about it you know use the best you can and keep adding more the best you can and don't worry about it the the money will be there it's it's just a crazy business that way the money will be there so once again I cast or what I would do is I would mix all this together take out my handy drill gun and mix it together but I don't have that so I'll just let the machine do it once again now the toughest thing to work with is this this sucks this stinks it's it's awful to work with it gums up everything make sure that peanut butter is the last thing you make during the day or during your run because inevitably you got to clean the machine after it so so I guess we can start throwing stuff in since we're letting the machine do it now how much is left in here five quarts because we used five on the other one so that's what we're gonna use so we're good you'll get used to handling these it's not as bad as you think although I will say that when I was teaching ice cream making I shouldn't say this it can only get you in trouble for some people it's hard and I tell them just divide it and conquer it you know just pour it into pitchers and then pour it into the machine it's a little easier I guess so that's five quarts of that what we want to do is add lots of chocolate do you want the recipe for that wealth all right we're going to use two pounds of chocolate of giardello chocolate powder if you want to start talking about expenses a batch considering that a batch will be ten quarts going in it'll be probably seven gallons coming out cost of ingredients run me between forty and eighty dollars to make a batch that's more than you all do because you know you'll cheap out in the beginning but now you will but it's a lot of money you know that I use to make a batch of ice cream but you know it is what it is it's what I choose to do okay so we're going to start the machine running somebody asked before why so that it mixes it instead of all these ingredients act like sandpaper inside of your machine so if you for instance if you didn't add the mix and just add the dry ingredients you're sandpapering the inside a machine you're wearing down this stainless steel so I like to start the machine have it have some juice in there and then add the dry ingredients let's go this way No okay so we'll add the chocolate and basically if you think about it we're only adding to the Reese's peanut butter cups what's in Reese's peanut butter cups we're adding peanut butter and chocolate to it you can stop now and have great chocolate ice cream some ice cream mix suppliers sell the mix in chocolate instead of just the now this is 10% vanilla they sell 10% chocolate to I don't have to clean it we're adding to 2 pounds 10 ounces of Reese's peanut butter cups with half a bag I divided it last night this isn't easy either that's why usually I do it in the bucket and use my gun but I don't have it and this is simply I mean you could sit deep this this is this is it this is a Reese's Peanut but I don't have to clean that up either Reese's peanut butter cups that are mushed up or whatever got to speak louder I got a machine running here no they were when I when I got here last night I frozen I used to take these frozen and put them in the ninja but then I found that I liked the pieces better this way in the ice cream and now the worst part is the peanut butter we're going to add 20 ounces of peanut butter which is one of these jars I have a little vest so we'll add a little from the other jar this sucks this part plus I don't have the normal spate of tools that I work with at my own place okay I guess a spatulas called for here that's better okay that'll do who said that see I knew you wouldn't say that let's add some vanilla how much peanut butter 20 ounces so how many ounces of five and that's it so you got it five five two pounds ten ounces 20 ounces and two pounds and you know when you think about it when you are making ice cream what could be bad with this and look what we put in there you know cream Reese's peanut butter and chocolate geez you can't hardly make a mistake it's gonna be good so is it mixed enough to start the refrigeration I guess so Wow well I guess you're all gonna learn how to eat out of a squeeze cup because that's what we've got left boy that is a standoff is that oh boy Wow that's gonna taste it okay chef Jeff says this is fantastic so come on up and get it hmm like that pump up a little more my goal is to kill you what so you had to do this class alone right oh you'll be exhausted no I don't want to do solo no me neither I did that last one that's the best thing that I made today this is chocolate peanut butter we're girl you you", "qDPi4buduY0": "I turned the peanut butter cup to properly take a bite and in doing so I over corrected this resulted in me smearing chocolate on my upper lip had I been just one degree under what I had calculated I would have successfully enjoyed the Reese's without making a mess which brings me to a story about aviation the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup challenges us to consume from the beginning there have been three steps in eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup first remove the wrapper this is best done quickly by turning the cup over grasping the outer fold and pulling away from the bottom second when I was young I would sprint to the corner store buy Reese's and run my hand through my hair before taking it down in one bite these days I don't sprint and I have no hair but the peanut butter cup remains if you have not eaten a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I plead with you eat one now enjoy the chocolate the peanut butter do not delay if you have thought oh that's not for me I plead with you to reconsider of all foods I treasure this one was the first in all about years I have Oates eaten my Reese's peanut butter cups in the same way the established way we have been instructed to eat them there is a far greater level in this world though those who believe that they can eat they're cutting away unconventional to the time-honored manner we must be true and faithful and eat our Reese's peanut butter cups in the customary and recognized approach as it is hit before been established I remember I ate my first resist peanut butter cup when I was a tender latter my mother came up to me I was loving twinkle in her eye I asked Tommy are you eating a Reese's I would invariably smile up to her oh yes yes I am but Tommy did you know that sister Jensen next door hasn't eaten a Reese's Cup in years my young minds thought upon the plight of my neighbor in the words of the poet quote tears were shed hearts were gladdened a cup was shared close whoa", "ka97YyRjXI0": "hey guys I'm so excited to share with you today how easy it is to make homemade healthy Reese's peanut butter cups I'm also gonna give you two options this one over here is gonna help you save on calories and give you more of that peanut buttery taste so let's get started sure stir first melt the chocolate in a double boiler on the stove or in a microwave using about a teaspoon you're going to place it in the center of a baking cup and then you're gonna draw up the sides it's always better to use less the first time and if you have extra chocolate you can go back and fill it in place this tray in your freezer while we make the peanut mixture in a small bowl as your peanut butter coconut oil and raw honey in order to combine these three ingredients we have to soften them so you can either place this bowl in a microwave for a few seconds or you can place this bowl in a larger bowl that has very warm water in it add a pinch of sea salt and give it one final stir your chocolate will be frozen by now so you can add the peanut mixture if you're going the route of skipping that bottom layer of chocolate to save on calories and to have more of a peanut buttery taste all you're gonna do is place the peanut butter mixture straight in the pan place this tray back in your freezer for a half an hour or until the peanut butter has hardened once the cups are frozen melt the rest of the chocolate finish both versions of the peanut butter cups with a top layer of chocolate and then place back in your freezer until they have fully hardened which should take about 30 minutes once you take them out of the freezer they will very easily come right out of the wrapper to get this version out of the tray just softly run your knife around the edges to loosen up the chocolate make sure you store these in the freezer because they will melt if you enjoyed this recipe please don't forget to give this video a thumbs up say hello in this section below and subscribe for more healthy desserts have a great

organic peanut butter cups trust me you won't be disappointed to see Boise snacks pace", "sdOyEKvlp7c": "hey guys what's up it is michael from lean body lifestyle and today i'm going to show you guys how to make a delicious version of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and it's actually going to be healthy it's going to be really simple I know people like the simple recipe so here we go let's get started and what we're going to do to start out with is take a scoop of chocolate protein powder you could use vanilla if you wanted to it just kind of depends on your preference but I'm just going to go with chocolate today and with this recipe just let you guys know ahead of time I'm going to be making one peanut butter cup but if you wanted to make like three or four obviously just multiply the totals for this recipe by four so start out with one scoop put that into a bowl then we're going to take one tablespoon of unsweetened baking cocoa and you don't really need this but again this really gives it an authentic chocolate taste and then I'm going to take two teaspoons of Truvia you could use stevia but I really think Truvia has more sugar like taste and that will taste good in this recipe because normal peanut butter cups are loaded with sugar so two teaspoons and now what I have here is a really small amount of water it's not even 1/8 the cup of water you're just going to add it in and then mix all this up alright so I just finished mixing this up and 1/8 of a cup of water worked perfectly you may need to add more or less just kind of depending on the consistency but it should be pretty thick kind of like this is what you're going to go for you don't want it to be too liquidy and now what we're going to do is I have one of these baking cups and they use these with muffins and other baked goods and you're going to take probably around half of this batter that we made and lay it in the bottom of the cup all right so I finish this one up and I filled it up about half way and now what you're going to do is put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes and that's going to allow us to spread some peanut butter on top of this so I will see you guys in around 30 minutes when this is a got a little bit harder all right so we're back around 30 minutes later and you guys can kind of see the chocolates hardened up a little bit and that's going to allow us to add some all-natural peanut butter and then what we're going to do is add another layer eventually of chocolate on top but for right now what we're going to do is probably add around a tablespoon or two tablespoons just depending on your preference of peanut butter all right so now we got the peanut butter on and it's going to go back into the freezer one more time for probably around 20 minutes just for the peanut butter to harden then what we're going to do is finish it off with another layer of chocolate so I'll see you guys in 20 minutes alright so here we are 20 minutes later as you guys can see the peanut butter has hardened up enough to allow us to spread our final layer of the chocolate sauce that we made here and pretty much that's going to do it I'm just going to take the remaining chocolate and spread that right on top alright so that is pretty much going to do it guys I just finished spreading the chocolate across the top and that's a final product that now at this point what I'm going to do is put it back into the freezer and wait for the top layer to harden but really gonna go through and film all that with you guys but compare this to a typical Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and I promise this one is going to be much healthier and it's also probably four times the size of a normal one as you guys can kind of see so it's going to be pretty filling you got a nice source of healthy fats with the peanut butter and you got around 30 grams of protein or so I'll have all that in the description and the most important thing is it's going to taste awesome a healthy substitute to one of the most unhealthy foods that you can eat so I hope you guys enjoy this definitely try it out simple I use minimal ingredients so I know you guys like those simple recipes and I hope you guys enjoy it and if you did please thumbs up the video because that helps me out so much and I appreciate it so much and also stop by my Twitter Facebook and blog those links will all be in the

here at eight live rest and welcome back or if it's your first time to our channel then welcome if you're into delicious and nutritious plant-based and veganized treats then hit that subscribe button you're gonna love it here and make sure you've got that Bell click to turn your notifications on that being said it is the month of February and that means love is in the air so what comes to mind when you think of Valentine's Day for me it's definitely chocolate today we've got a delicious sweet treat for you guys we're gonna make two ingredient peanut butter cups not just any peanut butter cups they are dairy free are sure to please the palate of any lover but they're also great for a little self-love as well [Music] so the two ingredients as you may have guessed are actually in the title they are both dark chocolate and peanut butter alternatively you can also use almond butter but we're going classic with this one you'll also be needing large in or small paper cups I found these on Amazon they will be linked below so measurements and amounts are going to vary based on the size of your cups and based on your hunger level so I've just gone ahead and measured out about a cup worth of my dark chocolate and probably about a half quarter cup of peanut butter first step is gonna be to pop your peanut butter into the freezer no longer than 10 minutes just a little bit to harden it up and make it easier to work with and simultaneously we're gonna go the opposite direction with the chocolate we're gonna melt it on the stovetop so while our chocolate is nice and melted down we're going to drizzle about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon in the bottom of each paper cup so now we're gonna pop our chocolate into the freezer for just about 10 minutes to let it solidify so now that our bottom layer of chocolate is solidified and our peanut butter is firmed up we're gonna go ahead and place a small dollop inside each cup we're gonna pop these back into the freezer just to make sure that peanut butter stays nice and firm dup and also make sure that you saved enough chocolate to place on top now we're gonna add the rest of our melted chocolate to the top and again place them back in the freezer for our final and finished product feel free to get artisanal and creative with the toppings you could top them with hemp seeds cacao nibs or our favorite sea salt you could also do coconut flakes but we're gonna do just some crushed sea salt so our vegan chocolate peanut butter cups are complete my mouth is watering it's time to serve these up and share them with your honey

those things or I used to love those things and now I know that they're full of sugar and things that are really bad for my body but that doesn't stop me from enjoying something like them so we're gonna make homemade peanut butter cups low carb today let's start with I've melted some chocolate and I've tried to make homemade chocolate I've made three batches today and always a fail so what seems to work best is to melt a low-carb chocolate bar now sukoon makes a great milk chocolate and so does cocoa polo and so does Lily's and cocoa polis what I'm using today I only had one milk chocolate because there are several folks in my family who loved us and they get into it even though I try to hide my stash and so I'm using one milk and one dark chocolate my family really loves the milk chocolate better than the dark chocolate and cocoa Polo is sweetened with stevia and a wreath wrote also it's really a nice mix Lily's chocolate is also great and like it a secret makes a great milk chocolate this is just what I had on hand when I started making it today and I did try to make homemade chocolate but it ended up being fudgy this is crisp and after refrigerating and it sets up it has that crunch to it and texture as you know is so important okay I'm going to start with the chocolate first now what I did was i melted those two bars plus 1 tbsp of refined coconut oil I use refined because my folks don't like the taste of the unrefined so I'm taking just a long iced tea spoon and I'm putting some chocolate and the muffin in a muffin tin this is a mini muffin tin and you saw I didn't use much and I'm taking the back of the spoon and pushing it up the sides of the muffin tin so you just put a little bit you don't ever do it you just want it coated you don't want it super super thick and we're going to do all of these and then we'll set them you can also do my husband's like wanting you mess with the minis why don't you just do the larger size and you can certainly do that he thinks that these might size are just a dead a waste of time if you're doing just a bite size this makes about 36 of them if you're doing the larger it does not make as many and again you want to go really thin with the chocolate don't ever do in it I'm just filling it up right now and then I'll go back and smooth it out but you want to do this first and then set it aside and let it cool while you're mixing up the peanut butter filling I'm going to hand this to my sweet gee and I'm gonna let her finish pushing that up the sides again you just want to smooth it around so that when you add the peanut butter to it it's going to cover the sides and I have okay thanks see her I have some of the larger ones ready to that I can do that with but she's gonna smooth that around and we're gonna make the filling filling is super super simple I have one jar this is Trader Joe's creamy peanut butter and I've just emptied the entire jar into my glass mixing bowl that's all that I've done and I have 1/8 of a teaspoon of cinnamon you can admit this but I really love it so I'm going to add that in and I have 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract pure vanilla extract make sure there's no propylene glycol in it you don't want the imitation vanilla and we're going to add the powdered sweetener and yes it can make a huge mess if you're not careful these peanut butter cups I remember the first year that I made them one of the recipes I've used calls for a little bit of honey just for a texture and I don't like using it you can use it I've also used a little bit of the secret syrups and those can work too if you have those on hand just a quarter cup or so of the dark sphere okay and now we're gonna mix this then you want this to be super super dry I was looking around for my spatula you want this to be super super dry and it almost becomes like a play-doh consistency if it isn't and you need it to be drier you can add a little sanding gum or some glue come on and that gives it a good texture as well but you do want it to be somewhat dry now I did when I put it in here I did put the peanut oil on there in there so don't drain that off okay and I am using just the peanut butter or just that is just peanuts and salt it doesn't have anything else added to it okay so once you have that done what is really helpful is to make little peanut butter balls an advance and when you make the little peanut butter balls you can just put them on parchment paper and then you want to kind of smush them down there's our technical term again press them down into like little disks and the size you make them is gonna depend obviously if you're making the minis or the larger ones but once you get them pressed down is just easiest to do it with a parchment paper doesn't have to be perfect we're going to cover up any messes with chocolate but just lay it down on top of the chocolate that you've already spread in the pan Hannah just goes right on top very easy to do and I am making a mess but this is very soft it's very dry excuse me it's not very dry I don't know whether I've used a different peanut butter in the past or just the sweetener I have just powdered granular granulated arethe root all in the past the peanut butter part is what's really best to us say don't Beast don't go don't do not adding a lot to it now again let me just say the number that of treats that are snake really depends on who's in the house with you and I know when my husband is in the house he it doesn't last as much because he likes to come by and reach around me and grab a couple spoonfuls so you might be able to use a half jar of peanut butter if you can get away with it but anyway you'll see them just laying it on top it will look much better at the finished product then when you're putting them away in the fridge you'll actually be surprised at how much better they look and I'm doing it like this to try to keep my hands cleaner but it's not working so great and you won't know that this is a little warm in here and if my kitchen was cooler it probably would behave a little better okay I almost got these done almost I tried taking these two and rolling them on some melted chocolate and you could do that like little Buckeye balls if that's what you want to do we like them as lychee puffs I'm smashing them out and then rolling them up but it's working okay and you can see they're all in there and now I'm just going to cover them with chocolate it doesn't take a lot you're probably going to do this and think how on earth does she get 36 I really don't use a lot of chocolate and you just want enough to barely cover it's very forgiving once it sets up that's all I'm doing is burying the peanut butter and put the chocolate it's kind of nice to bury peanut butter and chocolate okay I'm gonna finish covering these guys up and I will put them in the fridge our peanut butter cups got ready really quickly so this chocolate is perfect for setting up I have the miniature ones we did and then a couple of the larger ones so let's take a peek at what they look like this is the many that we did and I'm just gonna tell the taper off and actually we have been sitting out for a bit and it got soft on me and that's what they look like they're so cute I love the little ones and for me just one of these is really enough now my husband says it's not enough for him but he he has a healthier appetite than I do and again these have had not been in the fridge long say they're not real happy with me handling them but they set up really nicely and I'm going to bite into one I'm the only one here again and then to try this everybody has a life except for me and let's take a bite mmm we didn't see what it looks like mmm there's a layer of chocolate if it's set up longer my fingers would not be getting so messy but I wanted to hurry and get this video done let's take a peek at the larger one it's gonna make a mess isn't it mm-hmm let's take a look at the larger ones these have set up a little better and they've stayed cooler very thin but I just took them out well I took them out all that the same time that I'm trying to cut it into you can see that peanut butter in the middle and it looks just like a Ricci cap now I wouldn't normally tear them up like that but what I would do is take them out of paper gosh I would take them out of paper and just put them on a pretty serving tray and have them completely ready for Easter baskets you can wrap them in some pretty colored cellophane tie it with the ribbon I would probably stack maybe three of these up and tie it with ribbon and make them really pretty I heard but if you make homemade peanut butter cups with for your family did they enjoy them as much as mine dude", "yv-AleRoXnM": "hello and welcome to how to eat properly today's episode is going to focus on chocolate and peanut butter something that's very near and dear to my heart Reese's peanut butter cups it is 9:45 in the morning the perfect time to experiment with these sorts of things preparation beforehand you can wash your hands if you want I frankly not a big care about German person but to each his own is this is going to get good the other important point about this is that you must have warm hands okay cold hands find some way to warm them up like grab on to a curling iron or warm em up get your fingers warm Ingres need to be able to melt the chocolate you're going to remove the outer paper here and grab this with a thumb on the bottom and one or two fingers on the top I like to have two because you get better control do not move your fingers try to keep them in the same place because you'll get maximum melting that way you can see this circle in the inside you can tell where the peanut butter is you have to get rid of that outer edge of chocolate first so you can have an equal ratio in each bikes otherwise if you just take a big bite of this you can have too much chocolate the exciting part about this video is that it's already melting in my fingers so I'm going to have some really good chocolate left over here's how it works you start on the outer edge and take a bite just removing the outer chocolate and I have to be careful not to take too much of the peanut butter okay once you get about halfway done then you can move your fingers and what you do reposition so that now you're on the inner chocolate layer and then remove the rest of the chocolate mm-hmm okay we're home free once you get rid of this section here now is the best part because you have the proper ratio of chocolate to peanut butter and if your fingers are warm you're already starting to melt through that chocolate now you can eat regularly so just enjoy that peanut butter man oh it's a messy thing I'm not going to say it's not people are looking at you funny you have to be willing to just stick to your convictions and keep eating it the way that makes you happy it's a life lesson really I mean it's what it boils down to it's so good it even just sticks to the top of my finger now if you're lucky your peanut butter is really melty so as you sort of as you sort of work it around you get a little peanut butter stuck to your fingers now which is what you want hmm take your last bite you can be comforted knowing you still have some left to eat ten fingers the final taste I'm going to give you a hint here you want to make sure to start removing the peanut butter cup material from the finger with the least amount of peanut butter and then the final one the final exciting exciting move this one here look at all that peanut butter that got left are you're totally grossed out right now this is this is the proper way they don't put it on the instructions but this is the way so here we go success perfect a little bit of peanut butter and the final one now you take your deep breath you reconcile the fact that you're almost done and you fully appreciate this last little bit how would you properly eat a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup thank you for watching do not eat them any other way because you won't get the full satisfaction and face it you know when you're eating something like this you really want to get the best out of it so I hope you learned a lot today and I also hope that this can become a video that gets passed around from person to person from generation to generation and you know becomes a really positive learning tool so look out for another video that I'm going to put up very soon it's about a copycat recipe I did for Girl Scout tag-along cookies that's coming up real soon so you can as soon as that's done I'll put a link down on the bottom here so you can check that out too thank you for watching enjoy your peanut butter and chocolate deliciousness and I will have some more videos on the proper way to eat soon thanks hello", "hcUIZer8lSk": "[Music] i do believe i'm going to enjoy this video quite a bit so my favorite dessert growing up was a reese's especially the holiday ones with the thicker peanut butter layers so what i'm going to do today is try out some uh various different keto peanut butter cups and try to do some kind of comparison i have chalk zeros that we've been getting for quite a while i have some lilies peanut butter cups i have quest peanut butter cups equate which is like the walmart brand of peanut butter cups and slim fast peanut butter cups um the slim fast fat bomb ones so first let's uh let's look at the ingredients and the nutrition of each of these i'll try to remember to leave a thing here for the price of each of them as well um so this is first chalk zero they do have dark chocolate and white chocolate also but we're just going to do milk chocolate because that's what everything is here i believe um one cup is 80 calories six fat two protein four total carbs three five or one sugar so one net carbon and sugar ingredients are milk chocolate which is unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter whole milk powder soluble corn fiber fiber sunflower lecithin montford extract madagascar and vanilla beans and then roasted peanuts cocoa butter peanut flour sea salt monk fruit extract xanthan gum guar gum and natural vanilla flavor that is what is in this one now let's go to lilies starting size on lilies is two pieces um so let's just try to keep it even here so this one was 80 calories one of these is 85 calories um seven fat one and a half protein nine total carbs uh five fiber less than one sugar three erythritol sixteen two so one trying to see if it said somewhere so i can make sure i'm not missing something but at 18 carbs 10 five or six worth of tall that's two net carbs for two so one net carb is what it looks like um so clearly on the total carbs this one's four and this one's already jumped up on total carbs 9. um let's go to the next one let's do slim fast next all right slim fast uh serving size is one cup which is 90 calories so we've got 80 85 and 90 calories we're just slightly getting higher in calories for 90 calories eight fat two protein seven total carbs three five or two are tall so this one has the most net carbs so far at two net carbs um it's in between on total carbs it also has one sugar prayer ingredients on this are milk chocolate coating which is chocolate erythritol cocoa butter whole milk powder inulin which is natural vegetable fiber non-fat dry milk soy lecithin natural vanilla extract salt stevia leaf extract then there's an mc2 oil blend of palm kernel and palm and coconut oils inulin peanut butter which is peanuts erythritol milk protein isolate peanut flour peanut oil soy lecithin stevia leafy extract and salt these have basically the oils i cannot stay away from almost all the oils they use in this really i don't think i read the ingredients on lily's see what the ingredients in lilies are uh unsweetened cocoa cocoa butter erythritol chicory root fiber dextrin whole milk powder milk fat sunflower lecithin stevia extract vanilla extract peanut butter which is peanuts and palm kernel oil erythritol peanut flour trickery root fiber coconut oil palm oil salt sunflower lecithin stevia extract that's all in here there's a lot of ingredients in the peanut butter in this one um so none of them so far have the right oils i think this one is probably better ingredient wise the problem is the soluble corn fiber some people do have an issue with that i don't seem to at least not yet now let's go to these equate brand the walmart brand one piece is 90 calories eight fat two protein seven total carbs three fiber three sugar alcohols leaving into one net carb so same total carbs is the last one but less net carbs again three of the four so far have one net carb ingredients milk chocolate which is cacao butter erythritol cacao liquor dry whole milk inulin non-fat dry milk ammonium phosphate natural vanilla flavor salt and stevia it has medium chain triglyceride oil blend of palm oil and coconut oil peanut butter it does not say what is in the peanut butter in this one inulin peanut flour erythritol milk protein isolate peanut oil leaf and salt so this one has the same issue with the with the oils as the other as a slim fast one really a lot of similar ingredients there that brings us to quest quests peanut butter cups serving sizing this is two cups so i'll divide it by two so one cup is 85 calories seven and a half fat five and a half protein six and a half total carbs uh two fiber four erythritol so this one has about half of a net carb per cup uh total carbs or six and a half so the second lowest total carbon as well ingredients whey protein isolate erythritol unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter peanuts palm kernel oil soluble corn fiber sodium casinate contains less than two percent of the following sunflower lecithin sea salt butter fat natural flavor peanut oil and sucralose honestly as far as ingredients go and total carbs go this is probably my favorite also might be smaller than the others i don't know we'll have to see when we get into these but now what i'm going to do is i'm going to get some of these for us to taste um i'm going to put on bowls and label what they are on the bottom i can't promise i'm not going to know what they are just by the way they look but we'll try to make it at least some kind of mystery if we taste them um maybe nobody else will know i think everybody's going to know the chalk zero because we've had those so often um let's go try them see how they all taste [Music] so these are the quest ones check it out they have the wrappers and everything on them all right so i took a bunch of these boxes and i cut up some peanut butter cups the bottom of each one of these tells me which one it is and i mix them all up and then put letters across the top so we can kind of keep a running count so here's a um or c d b and e um that way we can kind of keep track of which ones we like uh and in what order and for the most part i don't know which ones are which i know which one's melted a little bit and i'm pretty sure i know which one those are but i'm not sure at all on those i think i mix them up as well as i could so we'll get to trying all right let's see the trend let's start with letter e here do you want that bigger piece or do you want a smaller piece let's go our face gives all your little pieces all right let's try ian see if we like it i don't think this is gonna be my favorite one whatever it is it tastes good it's not a very strong peanut butter taste though and i like the peanut butter taste that's my favorite it feels like the it feels like it tastes like like no like hot chocolate and half like all right what letter is next number eight all right now we got b let's give sawyer a little piece letter b [Music] you like it you like it more than the first one okay like i actually like it this one's got a harder peanut butter it's not as creamy as yellow [Music] doesn't taste like peanut butter just like something else this one do you know those um candies cookies cookies this is letter d oh i do you like that one all right sorry like that one [Music] this one's creamy you know i get sadie doesn't like this one where's that one [Music] that's the last one isn't it this one i don't taste peanut butter so it's good and creamy i like the texture but i don't taste anything better yeah i think it tastes good you like this one so you don't like this one i don't care much for this one it tastes good all right and now we got letter a these look like they melted a little bit or something they're kind of crumbly um they're saw you're a piece to try did you get one of these she's still in the second one she likes that i don't like this one i feel like they're just getting worse i know what was that hey a it's definitely not a on the list though i feel like oh we started up here and went down and the first one didn't taste good so far none of these i like this one that grade of peanut butter oh jennifer spit that one out that's how bad it was now what's the last one here letter c sit down i think i know what that is it says it on it it says it on it i didn't realize it it has part of the name on them [Applause] these are the only ones that have a bunch of a peanut butter face see what's that is it hard you like this one buddy [Music] okay i know which one my favorite and least favorite is yeah it's this hi daddy what i like this one because it's good hey i like this one yeah i like this one i know my first and last card i need to taste a couple of the others again get your rankings jennifer of course which one do i like again you like b you like this one yeah where's mine hey where's mine the kids seem to like whatever bee is it's good i think what's this one daddy peanut butter you guys that was that one this one that's what it tastes like you want creases this one right here that's what tastes like greases [Music] yeah it's pretty decent oh that's the first one we had you liked it i think you like this one more i like this not b the kids like me [Music] oh me and jennifer have one difference our number two and three are reversed so we all agreed e was the best for me and jennifer oh yeah i'm sorry c sailor wanted to join i said you want peanut butter cups all right me and jennifer both agreed c was the best it's also gone i agree this is the best this is talk zero they just won next for me is b and that's the one the kids like which was this one which is quest quest came in second for me and first for the kids and third for jennifer yep third for me and second for jennifer was e where is he that would be lily's lilies came in second virginia for throw for me we agreed on fourth which was d which are these which is the equate i will tell you four and five i thought we're both terrible and that leaves us with last place these slim fast these things i don't know if it was because they were melted but they weren't they were no good that's terrible [Music] i was big with the first three if i was getting any of these i think this is decent let's see zero lilies and quests it doesn't surprise me those are the top three [Music] yeah no it doesn't have sugar the cats don't need to taste it do they yeah all right everybody say bye [Music] you", "kfjhlqMo0SI": "today's video is sponsored by cove in today's video we are taking a look at over 10 pounds of Reese's peanut butter cups what happens if we extract all of the peanut butter and what can we do with it I love Reese's peanut butter cups they are fantastic like just the right number yeah today we went with the classic regular size there are also the there were big smarter bite size there's the bigger size yeah this is just the standard we've also seen some videos of people manufacturing their own giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup it goes pretty neat so today you're just gonna watch us eat it's gonna be a great video I'll watch it I don't know if I will so here's the basic idea you've seen us do lots of weird things with lots of different types of candy in the past today it's time for us to see what we can do with Reese's peanut butter cups it's sweeter than normal peanut butter  yeah it's different in a few ways it's not normal texture it's sweeter like you just said it seems to be slightly aerated and almost yeah flaky powdery maybe so I think what we want to do is figure out the best method for extracting the peanut butter while we're moving the chocolate and then we want to pull the peanut butter out of them all of them over that time we juiced gushers I don't like that I'm gonna be like that alright let's start by just putting all of the peanut butter cups Oh in this bowl unwrapping montage here we go you know how this goes now montage nate is over there unwrapping a whole bunch of Reese's peanut butter cups but break time 8 is sitting here on the couch I'm gonna tell you about today's sponsor the cove speaker so I had never heard of a cope speaker before but after playing around a fit and listening to music on it I am quite a fan one of the nicest things and I think this is a big point for them is the fact that you get your one speaker but it easily splits into two and you can put the two kind of wherever you want for a more around the house listening experience it's super quick and easy just goes together pops apart nothing to it but overall very easy to use this is the cove commuter to speaker which connects to phones tablets and computers with bluetooth 4.2 it's got a pretty good subwoofer built right into it which in our test got down to about 40 Hertz which is quite low and delivered some pretty good sound quality while it was doing it you can get about seven hours on a single charge with the speaker and it can be over thirty feet away from your computer or mobile device and still play clearly with no interruption with the two speakers together you're giving yourself a nice surrounding sound effect or you can split them apart and you're gonna give yourself a beautiful left and right stereo sound option Kove is currently offering 65% off of their speakers so if you would like to get one for yourself go ahead and click the link down in the description now alright I think montage me is about done unwrapping reese's so I'm gonna head back over there [Music] well we did it part one I would say because we've unwrapped everything now but we need to unwrap the peanut butter out of the chocolate problem is is right now this chocolate is very very soft and malleable and it kind of sticks to the peanut butter so our thought is that if we get it cold enough maybe it'll break off a little easier our fridge is entirely full right now but we have a styrofoam box and some dry ice so we're just gonna sort of dump the frigerator bit give it about ten minutes come back see if we'll be able to scrape the chocolate off the peanut butter by them I can bring the box over here you don't need to go anywhere but I did it you did and they didn't fall which surprises me a box of eleven pounds of Reese's peanut butter cups it looks like secret treasure smells like happiness and glory oh that's stuck to my phone bit that's fine I don't think we have any idea what the best way to remove the peanut butter is so we got some experimentation ahead of us [Music] [Music] this is where we tapped out we got to a stopping point we we got a jar of peanut butter we have many Reese's left we figured we got maybe two more pounds in we don't want to just use all of them up because a lot of people will would still eat these and we think we can achieve all of the experiments we want to deal with only this much peanut butter which is still it's a lot a lot of peanut butter so we want to try a couple things one one see what happens if we heat it up so we've got our little stove and we're gonna put some in a pan heat it regular peanut butter will melt a little bit it gets very gooey so we'll see if it does that is it it's much like we said it's kind of crunchy compared to regular dry yeah I also want to try making a peanut butter sandwich out of it this is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that was hollowed out to attract the peanut butter and then I filled it back up with Skippy peanut butter cuz of course you did now I want to see what a Skippy's peanut butter cup is like so it goes squishy right like softer [Music] it's good it tastes like a peanut butter cup it's very noticeable that the peanut butter flavor is different the there's more peanut butter flavor there's less sugar by a little bit and the texture obviously is the biggest thing it doesn't crumble and sort of dissolve in your mouth you see it even looks different it looks like it's been squished instead of broken up yeah smooth creamy doesn't yeah no crumbling to it so it is still good you can see the shrapnel and shards that we have it's a very different texture alright I'm throwing some in the pan it's kind of the texture of like a very dry sugar cookie dough what is the goal here well I was just trying to see if it would get a little mushy ER and smooth yeah because I want to make a peanut butter sandwich I think I don't have a really hard time spreading this as is in the meantime I'm actually going to see what happens if I add just like half a teaspoon of vegetable oil it should be peanut oil but we don't have any of that here so I just want to see if I can add that mix that up and get a slightly creamier texture this was a candle it failed horribly there's not enough wax in your Reese's peanut butter cups to make a viable candle you'll be happy to know thank goodness really glad that one failed long as I've got a good trajectory I'm just gonna keep adding a little bit more oil at time [Music] right I think I have achieved pretty close to a normal peanut butter texture here which means it's time for me to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first I'm gonna taste it would you like some fried peanut butter not really all right it's still sweet and it has that grainy texture and I don't know what exactly leads that maybe part of us the sugar maybe they just don't grind the peanuts as fine when they're making the peanut butter in the first place that's okay but now I'm going to try making my sandwich and callee that looks quite a bit like dog food it's terrible it smells a little bit like dog food doesn't melt much it doesn't melt it's burning badly if for a second it's not like peanut butter cookies and now it's just burning I'm turning this off it does not no don't do this with your Reese's peanut butter cups guys I don't know why you would but don't hey guys we could have melted the chocolate off the peanut butter this whole time it just slept right off so we went the wrong direction we went the wrong direction with cooling it down yep I'm gonna be honest there's no right direction go there's that saying there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's I think we found that we found the wrong way don't open them up take the peanut butter out and cook it on the stove that's the wrong way to eat a Reese's you guys with your slogans or wrong we're sorry Reese's we love you we understand that what we've done is an abomination I'm sorry I'm back in a way though peanut butter sandwich made with authentic Reese's peanut butter cups peanut butter no Reese's actually makes PE put in a jar you can buy and I think that's just normal peanut butter we don't have any bet we just have the stuff extracted from the cups so here goes white bread Reese's peanut butter thinned out with a little bit of oil to make it spreadable and with some jam added to it [Music] how is it the grainy texture is coming through okay not bad so you can keep enjoying that I'm just gonna order this it's not gonna be the same I didn't work for it no I mean it's literally he's not going to be the same it'll be actually smooth not grainy it's very sweet overall it's acceptable is it too sweet with the jam cuz that would be my concern so this is like American white bread which is pretty sugary bread the jam is quite sugary and now with the peanut butter also being sugary it's pretty intense honestly I would say go with the regular peanut butter if the better texture less sugar congratulations Internet we did it we found the wrong way to eat Reese's as we explained we did not use up all of the Reese's we didn't want to just let them all go to waste we have about seven pounds left many reasons peanut butter cups still available you have things you want to see done with Reese's peanut butter cups or other strange candies we can give it a shot except not with that one he's gonna eat that one thanks again to coab for sponsoring this

corn syrup that they make with peanut butter uh hello jeff sorry you didn't sponsor this um but i call it reese's peanut butter cup because that's essentially what it is now let me ask you this before we started keto have you ever heard the term fat bomb nip okay so that seems to be a term that has floated around in the keto space is that right i think so fat bomb okay so wait nobody before keto fat was so and coal yeah and so not fetch yeah fat that bombs word yeah that's that's scary well so you hear it and you're like fat bomb what is that anyway now i hear it i'm like heck yeah yeah sign me up whoa jinx anyway fat bomb is what we call them well these are peanut butter fat bombs now granted we've showed you and i'll link this in a card above us keto snacks that you can have all the time and we have fat bombs on that video the card is right above it you can link on that you mean the ones that we bought at the store yes yeah there's tons of fat bombs they're very lilies lilies does a fat bomb um slim fast does a fat bomb that's usually where we uh usually purchase ours from because lily's is a little more on the high side of cha-ching you know what i'm talking about but anyway lily's i don't know who else i'll you know does fat bombs out there there's that one i don't remember the name of it but the one well wait a minute chocolate coffee yeah oh yeah who is that i don't know it said ketogenic on the package yeah write it in the like scroll it across i don't know if i can do that you can do it maybe i can i don't know but anyway those are very delicious yes but anyway i keep saying that anyway fat bombs is what they call them they're basically reese's peanut butter cups now we do we do have bought we have bought some from slim fast we do have bought yes exactly words are tough here uh where there's caramel in the middle yeah so you can inject caramel you can inject anything you want to in these because why you're in control of your destiny when you cook it at home like this right yeah and it's cheaper i i did the math way cheaper and it is cheaper we could sell these down at the local publix right outside of the sidewalk if we got a permit of course wait for 50 cents like girls count cookies yeah for 50 cents and we'd walk away with a smash a killing anyway right we wouldn't mark it up that much let's go anyway let's get this bacon this is the mold description will be in the link below so you can purchase this on amazon if you so desire because i strongly suggest you use these because they're so dang easy let's get cooking okay and for today's recipe we're going to use 8 ounces of cream cheese 1 4 cup of powdered erythritol 1 3 of a cup of peanut butter that's going to be for the peanut butter mixture and then for the chocolate mixture we're using 10 ounces of lilies chocolate chips i'm gonna i only have five here because we're going to use this as the bottom part i have a half of a tablespoon of coconut oil and then i'm going to use the same ingredients for the top part when we layer because we're going to layer it can't you see [Music] easy [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] man does the walk back which i like it's a standard okay here's the fat bombs you just saw us made them or you just saw her make them so you know how to do this now but here's the finished product and i use these little cute little things here because the little ridges so it makes it look like an actual like little mini greasy cup right you don't have to use dude they everything just pops out of this you don't even have that well we just showed them oil or anything you don't have to use oil but you can put it in this but it will just be smooth so i like the little ridge because i think it's cute well yeah it gives it a nice presentation because if you made it with just the mold it was just have a solid circular round you could do that if you don't care if you just pop them in your mouth for the football game all right so which one am i gonna get uh oh and also you can look at a little bit of moisture on the top it's because we like just got them out of the freezer and let them start okay are you popping the whole one are you gonna bite in half um i don't know let me try this hold on hmm what okay oh and you also saw that um i just smashed down right there so are you going to share with me uh you get your own oh wow i like the little you can like probably do better than i did getting the chocolate all the way up the side if you wanted to but i kind of like the little the little multi-color you know whatever yeah you could make it to where you could see like this one for example you could go all the way around and she almost did but it's solid on the back mm-hmm and but you can see it in the middle it just makes it a nice little presentation because the reese's peanut butter cup is solid around you don't see the peanut butter but you should but when i was making these bottoms like that's not going to taste like peanut butter it's gonna taste like cream cheese well i know reese's peanut butter cups as more of a peanut but you know that when you bite into it it tastes like i'm eating a piece of peanut butter maybe we'll try these and we don't need the cream cheese and we'll have a taste test one day how about you make the ones that don't use cream cheese i will and i'll do a video by myself she won't be in it it'll be a surprise good it'll be like a birthday gift mmm wow those are so good these are good you want to keep these in the fridge because of the cream cheese and because um it probably i don't guess lilies and slim fast they have some way of being able to make them not like melty yeah because we leave those in our pantry and we open them up and they're not melted at all they are a little soft especially in the 80 degrees if i keep one in my pocket while i'm cutting grass sure i'll reach in there and it's a fine mess wow but uh you know who's doing that i feel like chocolate everywhere i feel like i got something on my fingers it's so good but yeah you can even keep them in the freezer because like we had them in the freezer to get hardened and we actually kind of ate one that was frozen we split it yeah and it was like frozen and it was good it's kind of like you know like that one i don't like it as i don't like it as good as this the when it's frozen i have a hard time because i gotta bite into it unless i'm gonna pop the whole thing in my mouth and just let it melt did you ever put candy bars like when you're a kid ever put candy bars in the freezer oh yeah yeah so it's kind of like that yeah exactly oh i found it here so this is different so i was singing the reese's song so it's susan's peanut butter fat bomb i like that why didn't you open well i should have but i forgot because copyright infringement or i could do susan's keto fat bum you could pick whichever one you want so that's the video guys i hope you enjoyed the fact oh by the way i was going to say this too there are a ton of fat bomb videos in the keto space you can do a youtube search and find a million so people have made this is no this is no secret uh but this is the first time that we've made them and i think they're probably the best ones on the internet i'm just saying i mean i i'll probably haven't tried anybody else's probably people will see this video and go i'm making that because it tastes the best it was so good you it is it's really good wait you don't have to use lily's chocolate you can make your own chocolate out of like cocoa and butter or coconut oil or whatever you can make your own chocolate you don't have to use lilies and so you could actually make it even cheaper than what you've made so you're just drilling down all the way i mean like make everything from scratch let's do it that's how they used to do it in the 20s hey we're back in the 20s [Laughter] anyway that's the video guys hope you enjoyed it if you are going to make this recipe please give us a thumbs up share this video and also leave us a comment below of what you thought that this fat bomb tasted like and until next time remember keep it on the fat bomb don't even make sense keep it on the fat bomb please can somebody give us suggestions [Music] you", "jwNG4AA8VR0": "By far one of the most popular chocolate treats\nin the world is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. It's hard to find the words that can\ntruly describe just how great these things are, but the fact of the matter is that almost\neveryone loves them. Well, as it turns out, the candy has an interesting story behind\nit as well. These are 10 secrets that will change the way you eat Reese's. Reese's First Candies Were A Bust The entire story of the Reese's Peanut Butter\nCup starts with one man: Harry Burnett Reese. The mastermind behind the beloved candy didn't\neven start out working in a different industry (which is how these stories typically begin).\nHis first major job was actually working for Hershey's in a milking facility known as the\nRound House. Reese started humbly enough, working as a milker before moving up into\na management position. However, the facility was eventually closed, and Reese found himself\nout of a job.\u00a0Having had experience in the confection game, Reese decided to strike out\non his own and make his own sweets. Unfortunately, the first things he tried were not entirely\nsuccessful. He began simply enough, with chocolate almonds and raisins. While this might have\nactually worked as a business today (although you would have a lot of competition to deal\nwith), back then the candies did not do well, and Reese found himself struggling to keep\nup with other candy makers.\u00a0Reese eventually had to admit defeat when he couldn't afford\nto make the candies anymore. He actually wound up going back to Hershey's and working in\ntheir shipping department. Even though he once again worked his way up to the job of\nforeman, Reese wanted more. He Named Chocolate Bars After His Kids Reese looked at the success of Hershey's and\nknew that if one candy company could make it in America, then certainly another one\ncould as well. While continuing to work for Hershey's, Reese experimented with his own\ncandy concoctions at home. His first big success came in the form of a bar named after his\ndaughter. The Lizzie bar was a combination of caramel and shaved coconut that was covered\nin chocolate (that actually sounds pretty delicious). The bar was a major success.\u00a0Along\nwith the Lizzie bar, there was also the Johnny bar, which was made with molasses and named\nafter Reese's son. It must be something of an honor to have a chocolate bar named after\nyou, so Reese's kids were probably thrilled. Due to the success of the bars, Reese eventually\nquit his job at Hershey's and tried once again to make it on his own. This time, however,\nhe was met with a lot of success, and it all had to do with one specific candy: the now-famous\nand ubiquitous peanut butter cup.\u00a0Reese didn't know it at the time, but this combination\nof chocolate and peanut butter would eventually become one of the best-selling and most popular\ncandies in the world. Of course, since he had no idea how popular they would be, they\ndidn't quite get the chance to shine right away. The First Peanut Butter Cup Was Part of An\nAssortment Reese had incorporated his own company and\nwas moving forward on making all kinds of different sweets. It wasn't until five years\nafter incorporation that he made the very first peanut butter cup, the candy that would\neventually change the chocolate game for good. When he created the peanut butter cup (then\nknown as a 'penny cup' since each one only cost a cent), he didn't know what kind of\namazing thing he had created. In fact, he didn't really see the potential in it at all.\u00a0That\nmight be why the original peanut butter cups were just thrown into assortment bags that\nwere then sold to vendors. That's right, the peanut butter cup wasn't even leading the\npack. It was just thrown into a bag with a bunch of other stuff. It almost seems crazy\nto us now that the peanut butter cup should just be pushed to the side, not even given\nits own rollout, display, or packaging, but that's the way it was. However, people buying\nthe bags quickly realized just how amazing the peanut butter cups were, and it wasn't\nlong before they were being sold on their own.\u00a0Of course, a major worldwide historical\nevent was about to change everything, including how candy would be made. Luckily for Reese,\nThis actually ended up working in his favor. Peanut Butter Cups During WWII When the Second World War broke out, it was\na time of great conflict. It was also a time of great rationing, as supplies needed to\nbe doled out to the soldiers on the front lines. People were willing to make do with\nwhat they could so that the military could keep their fighting men fed and fuelled up\nfor combat. Two of the most rationed items during this time were things that really hit\nthe candy industry, however: sugar and chocolate.\u00a0With these two essential candy items being rationed,\nit meant that candy production in the United States was going to slow down, at least in\nsome ways. However, this was not a problem for Reese, as he had the advantage of using\npeanut butter in his most popular candy. Peanut butter was not being rationed at the time,\nwhich meant that there was an abundance of it stateside. That meant that Reese could\nkeep producing his best-selling signature candy without requiring as much of the rationed\nfood items.\u00a0On top of all that, Reese found a way to automate the creation of the peanut\nbutter cups, meaning that he could churn out hundreds of them in a very short time frame.\nAll of a sudden, the American market was flooded with the delicious candy, and Reese had finally\nmade it as a chocolatier. This brought him to Hershey's attention. Hershey Ended Up Buying Reese's Harry Burnett Reese passed away in 1956, but\nhis candy would go on to even greater success. Once it became apparent that the Reese's Peanut\nButter Cup was going to be a big hit with people, they caught the attention of Reese's\nformer employer, Hershey. The Reese corporation had originally been left to Reese's six sons,\u00a0Robert,\nJohn, Ed, Ralph, Harry, and Charles Richard. However, in 1963, the sons decided to merge\nthe company with Hershey in a massive deal.\u00a0The company was brought under the Hershey banner,\nand it ended up being a hugely lucrative deal for the chocolate giant. Even though Hershey\nhad already enjoyed massive success with its own chocolate bars, the Reese's Peanut Butter\nCup became its best-selling product by 1969. Hershey has still reaped massive benefits\nfrom buying Reese's. The peanut butter cup became the best-selling candy in the United\nStates in 2012, along with being the fourth best-selling candy brand on a global scale.\nHarry Reese probably never even knew that his candy would become such a massive phenomenon\nand that it would eventually become the basis for tons of spin-off confections like sugary\ncereal, ice cream, and even jars of Reese's peanut butter spread. Of course, the most\nsuccessful take on Reese's peanut butter is the one that almost everyone is familiar with:\nReese's Pieces. Reese's Pieces are Missing Something The next step in the evolution of Reese's\npeanut butter was cramming it inside of a candy shell similar to an M&M. Thus, Reese's\nPieces were born. The little yellow, orange, and brown candies weren't a huge hit, but\npeople did seem to like them when they hit the market (they even remain popular to this\nday). Now, you may have noticed that we haven't mentioned a certain word yet in talking about\nReese's pieces, which is why what we're about to say might kind of blow your mind.\u00a0Some\nof you may have already picked up on it, but the word missing from the description from\nReese's Pieces is, of course, chocolate. \"Wait a minute,\" you might be saying, sitting back\nfrom your computer in shock, \"There is most definitely chocolate in Reese's Pieces! Everyone\nknows that!\" Well, we hate to burst your bubble, but there most certainly is not. Reese's Pieces\nare nothing more than that delicious peanut butter filling inside of a candy shell. No\nchocolate to be found!\u00a0Reese's Pieces may be popular today, and, in fact, one of the\nmost popular peanut butter cups being sold right now is the big cup filled with the pieces\n(which, by the way, are so delicious). However, the little pieces weren't always as popular\nas you might think, and the boost in popularity came from an unlikely source. E.T. Made Reese's Pieces Way More Popular Steven Spielberg was at the top of his game\nin the eighties. He had already directed three surefire hits with\u00a0Jaws,\u00a0Close encounters\nof the Third Kind, and\u00a0Raiders of the Lost Ark. His next big picture was going to be\nmore of a family affair, albeit one with a science fiction aspect to it as well:\u00a0E.T.\nthe Extra-Terrestrial. The film told the story of a young boy dealing with his own personal\nproblems while also harboring an alien and trying to get him back home.\u00a0One of the most\nmemorable parts of the film comes right at the beginning when Elliott, the young boy,\ndiscovers that the E.T. is hiding in his family's tool shed. In an attempt to lure him out of\nhiding, Elliott places Reese's Pieces on the ground leading to his room. This scene immediately\nconnected Reese's Pieces with one of the most successful films of all time, and sales of\nthe candy began to skyrocket, rising almost 60% after the premiere.\u00a0What makes this even\nfunnier is that Spielberg had originally wanted to use M&M's in the scene, which to be fair,\nis the more obvious choice. However, the Mars corporation turned down his offer to have\ntheir product featured in the film. Reese's leaped at the opportunity and embarked on\na cross-promotional advertising initiative with the film as well. There Was a Flavor Based on Elvis You might think that there's not a lot of\ncustomizing you can do with a peanut butter cup. After all, how do you improve on perfection?\nHowever, Reese's has constantly found ways to make their candy more interesting and different.\nSure, they started out simply enough, with just peanut butter and chocolate in a little\ncup, but things got a lot more interesting as time went on. In fact, you've probably\nseen a lot of the different flavors and peanut butter chocolate delivery systems made by\nthe company on store shelves.\u00a0The first innovation was the crunchy peanut butter cups, an obvious\nfollow up to the smooth peanut butter. Then came some other variations, mostly in size.\nThe mini peanut butter cups have always been a big hit, and then the big cups that came\nout years later delivered even more of what people loved about the originals. There have\nbeen dark chocolate cups, white chocolate cups, and the aforementioned big cups with\nReese's Pieces inside. There have been Reese bars, bites, and, of course, Easter eggs.\u00a0One\nof the craziest concoctions the people at Reese's ever came up with though, was a peanut\nbutter cup celebrating Elvis, which included a smear of banana cream along with the peanut\nbutter in the middle. This was an ode to the King's favorite snack: a peanut butter and\nbanana sandwich. Reese's dominates the holidays One of the best days of the year when you're\na kid is by far Halloween. Not only do you get to dress up as your favorite monster,\nsuperhero, or anything else, but you also get to walk around your neighborhood and get\ncandy, for free! And while there may be a lot of gross candy to sift through, there\nare also the coveted candy prizes, the things that every kid wants in their bag. Chief among\nthem is the king of all candies, the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.\u00a0While that might just\nsound like an opinion, it's actually the truth. Reese's dominates at Halloween, accounting\nfor the highest sales of any candy during the holiday. And it's not just Halloween that\nis completely owned by the peanut butter cup. As Reese's has branched out into other shapes\nfor their treats, they have also come to dominate the market during Christmas and Easter as\nwell. It just goes to show just how powerful the combination of chocolate and peanut butter\ncan be. People just can't get enough of them.\u00a0It's hard to deny the massive amount of influence\nthat Reese's Peanut Butter Cups have had on the candy industry, and it actually goes so\nfar that people have decided that there needs to be an entire 24 hour period of celebration\nfor this amazing candy. May 18 is \"I Love Reese's Day\" There are plenty of holidays where Reese\u2019s\npeanut butter cups become the star of the show, but there is only one day a year when\nReese's truly gets to shine: May 18th. That's because back in 2010, a Facebook petition\ngot over 400,000 signatures to declare that day \"I Love Reese's Day.\" You might think\nit's weird for a candy to have its own made-up holiday, but it's hard to deny the fact that\npeople really do love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.\u00a0Just look at how the cups are packaged:\nthree cups in a sleeve. That means that the candy inherently promotes sharing, which is\na good lesson to teach at any time of the year. Not only that, but there's something\nto be said about the industrious and upstart nature of the candy's history, formulated\nin the basement of one man who had a vision of making a better candy. So there you have\nit. Turns out those delicious, soft, melt-in-your-mouth cups combining the richness of chocolate and\nsalty-sweet flavor of great peanut butter have a far more interesting story than almost\nany candy out there.

Looking good right and they taste amazing\ntoo which is obviously the best thing about it and you know what the cool thing is normally\nyou only need 3 ingredients but because the other day I made my own homemade peanut butter\nI only needed two so if you wanna have a go at making this hit pause now and write that\nmassive ingredients list down this is how you do it. Quarter fill your saucepan with cold water\nthen under a low flame put a mixing bowl on top of it shove in the chocolate then stir\nit until it gradually melts together and it's super smooth. With your chocolate melted arrange some cupcake\ncases onto a tray now I use the standard size ones but you can get these little diddy ones\nor you can get the massive muffin ones that sounded wrong but you know what i'm saying\nor you could obviously do that huge giant mould thing that James did in the other video. So what you want to do is start to add a little\nbit of chocolate into the bottom of all of those just to cover that initial layer and\ngive it a base. With all your bases done you're gonna plonk\nit in the fridge for fifteen minutes just to initially set. Once the fifteen minutes is up and your base\nis just firm enough to hold the peanut butter spoon down the peanut butter now I must point\nout i'm using the homemade stuff as I say so it was a little thicker and I could get\nthat consistency I wanted the stuff you buy in a store you might want to thicken that\nup a little bit and actually sweeten it too with some icing sugar so that's where that\n3rd ingredient would come in. So get your peanut butter all around the edge\ndon't let it touch the edge just give it a little gap all the way around just kind of\nlike a little disc on top and then it's ready for an extra layer of chocolate so pour that\nmelted chocolate on top and completely coat it spoon it around so that it's nice and level\nthen whack it in your fridge to fully set. It's gonna need a good 45 minutes to an hour\nin there to completely firm up once they are ready unpeel them from your cases and that\nis it all done looking good and they've even got that ripply edge look around the side. So if you enjoyed this video don't forget\nto give it a thumbs up, share, comment, subscribe and all that stuff. But that is it, told you it was easy, hope\nyou give it a go, that is how you make your very own homemade reese's peanut  butter cups.", "0me27-L8llg": "what's up everybody welcome back to my channel

these it was about fourteen to fifteen dollars but again I'll post the description down below all right so first I'm going to take a bowl and then I'm gonna take my Chuck zero bag I'm only using one bag and then I'm gonna pour half of the bag into the bowl then I'm going to take some coconut oil and I'm gonna use about a teaspoon the coconut oil just kind of helps the chocolate melt together better so I like to use the organic coconut oil it has a nice coconut flavor to it so I just warmed that up for 30 seconds and then I'm gonna go ahead and mix it all together the bottom of the bowl is nice and warm so it kind of helps to melt all of the chocolate chips so you just want to keep mixing until all of the chocolate chips are combined and it has like a nice smooth consistency all right so once it's mixed together I'm gonna take a tablespoon and my silicone mold and for this for the first part I used about half of a tablespoon so this filled up about 12 of these little cups so just half a tablespoon use it all up you guys even it all out and use it all up so then I'm just gonna let this to I'm gonna put in the freezer for like I don't know five minutes or something like that

did this the oil was still in there and it made it hard for the white chocolate to harden so I'm just gonna pour out the oil and then I'm gonna take a plate and a napkin and I'm using a teaspoon of peanut butter so you just want to get 12 teaspoons ready for your peanut butter cups when it's done chilling the fridge so I'm using a napkin you know if there's excess oil or then you can just pretty much dry it out let him take the rest of my bag chocolate chips another teaspoon of coconut oil and I just heated that up again for 30 seconds again you just want to keep mixing until all of the chocolate chips are melted together and it has a nice smooth consistency okay so my white chocolate in the mold should be nice and hard and then I'm gonna take my teaspoons of peanut butter and I'm gonna kind of shape it into a little ball just throw it on top of the hardened white chocolate make sure you push the peanut butter down so it's kind of leveled with the top of the mold I don't know you don't have to do that but I'm kind of OCD and then I just Pat the peanut butters that are too oily and then I'm gonna do what I did the first time I'm just going to take a tablespoon and use about half to fill up my mold to the top and it was the amount of white chocolate was perfect I was able to fill up the rest of the cups and finish the rest of the white chocolate so just fill that up once it's all filled just door back in the freezer for about five minutes should be harden in five minutes so my white talking utter cops are chilling in the fridge the trolley and once they're done I will show you guys the end result and I already know they're gonna be delicious okay guys so my recess well my white my Kido white chocolate peanut butter cup is ready it's all harded up and now we just got to take it out the silicon and taste it look at that looks just like a freaking recess so freakin bomb you don't have to miss candy so good it's actually kinda dangerous it is go girl anyways I will go ahead I want to show you guys how I calculated like the carbs and stuff pretty much all I did was add all the ingredients which was one bag of white chocolate chips by chalk zero and then there's 12 cups which I used 1 teaspoon for each so there's 12 teaspoons of peanut butter and then I also added about 2 teaspoons of coconut oil so yeah basically you just add all the ingredients together and you divide it by 12 and that I'll show you how much like carbs is in each of these so there's about think about 2 grams of net carbs per Reese's Cup about 100 and something calories you can still see all the exact numbers up here but dude Gold's Amazon and get you your chunky zero white chocolate chips it is hella bomb I hope you guys enjoy this video Bill's video was actually just

and I am very happy to share this recipe with you there's anything you know about me from watching my videos it's that I absolutely love peanut butter so what I'm going to show you how to make today is a quick and easy no-bake peanut butter cup so for the ingredients all you're going to need is some type of protein powder chocolate preferably also going to add in for those of you that have used this before the Walden's farms chocolate syrup if you're against walden farms or you can't find this item you can get it from nutrition com or you can omit it from the recipe completely also going to add in a little stevia and that's going to make our chocolate peanut butter cup part and then whatever peanut butter you guys like is going to go on the center you're also going to need some type of cupcake tin or whatever it's called and I'm gonna put it in a baking pan on the last time I tried making this and I just set it in the freezer like this at ended up getting all crazy so going to use a baking pan to kind of keep it nice and meat so what we're going to do is just take one scoop of your protein powder probably won't use it all depending on how many peanut butter cups you guys want to make one scoop a nap one tablespoon of our studio sweeten it up a little bit more and I'm going to add a tablespoon of the walden farms and what we're going to do is just add enough water to this you want it to stay thick so you got to add the water very slowly you guys know that add water to your protein powder can get soupy really quickly so I'm just going to mix up what I got here with the syrup a little bit and I'm just going to slowly add a little water to this because I wanted to stay nice and thick you wanted almost like a paste you can go so easily from being Dec 22 soubise so i'm pretty sure i've got enough water in there alright so I've got that all mixed up what I'm going to do is just scoop it on in there for the bottom of the peanut butter cup i'm not going to add all of it just yeah this might get my counter a little messy here okay now we're just going to add about a tablespoon of peanut butter for the center of our peanut butter cup and it's easier if you just use your finger to get it there okay and just let that get in the center of your peanut butter cup okay close enough so tempted to lick my fingers but I'm not going to because I can't have peanut butter right now I'm three weeks out you guys all right and just the rest of the chocolate to cover our amazing peanut butter cup all right perfect so you can see there's still some batter left I could probably do another peanut butter cup I'm not just kind of wanted to show you guys how it's going to look so what I'm going to do is place this in the freezer for you guys and I'm not sure yet how long it's going to take to set so i'll let you know and show it to when it comes out all ready to go all right everyone i've taken our delicious peanut butter cup out of the freezer I left it in there for about almost three hours and it seems to be about the right temperature it's up to you guys could play with it and see how long it really needs to be in there so you can see it's a nice big peanut butter cup feels like you could probably leave it in there last time if you're really anxious Lee a waiting to eat it I'm just going to try to cut this in half to show you guys what it'll look like if I can I may have to saw it a little bit I think I need it better night I know use those muscles ok I'll chocolate on me but that's okay kind of gets a little melty as soon as you take it out of the freezer again it's just protein so it's gonna it's going to melt fairly quickly but you can see it's like a delicious peanut butter cup trying to open it up it's a little messy but this could be a great little snack for you post to work out there you go little messy but I guarantee you this will taste amazing i'll give you the nutritional information below this might be a nice little clean dessert for you guys to have as well too just to kind of you know keep yourself in the right right track with clean eating without going too overboard so hope you guys try this recipe out let me know

chocolate and peanut butter the saltiness of the peanut butter is the perfect foil to the sweetness of milk chocolate this bar features a thick layer of milk chocolate around a sweet salty and crunchy peanut butter candy Center making that peanut butter candy Center is the tricky part to make the candy part of it the factory combines liquid sugar corn syrup coconut oil and molasses they mix and heat these ingredients for about eight minutes [Music] the cook candy is poured into a large stainless steel bowl next they add leftovers from the previous batch of candy they call these leftovers rework because they rework them into this new batch once the rework has mixed with a hot new candy they empty the bowl onto a cold stainless steel table [Music] they blend the candy until the two birds into a sweet gooey mess [Music] once the candy has cooled a bit workers fold it up and carry it over to the polling station there they make a pocket in the center and fill it with vanilla extract they start up the polling machine which stretches the candy non-stop for about five minutes this infuses the candy with air so that its consistency resembles taffy rather than hard candy they transfer the candy to a belt that carries it to the waving machine the machines rollers flatten the candy into a thin sheet then a pump draws piping hot peanut butter from this tank and deposits it in a generous layer onto the candy sheet workers roll up the sheet until it reaches a specific diameter at that point they fold and place it on a sheet without peanut butter called a blank sheet the next roller presses the folded roll flat onto the blank sheet workers roll up the blank sheet sealing the peanut butter candy inside this complex assembly is what forms the flaky layers in the chocolate bar center workers round the sheet between two rollers and feed it to the rope sizer it stretches the peanut butter candy into a rope that's the exact diameter of the chocolate bar Center the next machine makes a pinch mark every 5 inches or the length of a chocolate bar the link centres enter a cooling tunnel they exit 5 minutes later rigid the links separate as they drop to the next conveyer belt they pass through a second refrigerated tunnel which finishes cooling them dissenters move into lanes that feed the in Rober a machine that coats the centers with chocolate workers make sure the center's are single-file and properly spaced the aroma is like a confectionery carwash centers pass through a hot rinse of milk chocolate first then an overhead dryer blows off any excess leaving behind a three millimeter layer of chocolate [Music] the bars enter a final cooling tunnel to harden the chocolate [Music] workers transfer the finished chocolate peanut butter bars to a conveyor belt for packaging [Music] as the bars approach the rapping machine the in feeder arranges them in single file rolls of printed plastic film unwind into the machines forming box in the blink of an eye the machine folds raps and heat seals the film around each passing bar a revolving knife slices the wrapper between bars then it's off to the packaging Department where workers pack them 24 - a box these chocolate peanut butter bars are ready to be devoured by anyone in the mood for a crunchy sweet and salty chocolate snack", "0YDGhRUfihc": "hi guys welcome to my kitchen and welcome to iHome this is my nephew Farris and we're chillin at home today and so we are craving we feel like eating something sweet and so we were like you know wondering what to eat and I got an idea is to make my favorite chocolate ever today we're going to make peanut butter cups peanut butter cups are like the easiest thing to make seriously they require literally three ingredients actually two if you skip on the powdered sugar so the first ingredient which is optional is the powdered sugar I find it and not adding the powdered sugar makes them the peanut butter cup not sweet enough but if you like the taste of peanut butter alone with the chocolate that's fine you don't have to add the powdered sugar the second ingredient is chocolate chips now I like milk chocolate chips but if you prefer the taste of dark darker chocolate then you can definitely use semi-sweet chocolate chips and the last but not least ingredient of course is the peanut butter smooth or creamy peanut butter so let's start okay the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take one-third of the amount of the chocolate chips and I'll tell you why later and I'm going to melt this chocolate and today I'm going to melt it in the microwave now if you never melted chocolate before please watch my how to melt chocolate the right way video and please watch that video if you never melted chocolate before because it can be a little bit tricky or around one tablespoon of chocolate in each liner and just twirl it around to make it flat and then when you're done tap it a few times to get it even straighter so we're going to put this in the fridge for approximately 1 hour until the chocolate solidifies so now I'm going to mix the peanut butter with the sugar but first I'm going to put the peanut butter in the microwave for 30 seconds to make the step easier so now that peanut butter is smooth and soft so now we're going to add the powdered sugar and stir thoroughly until all the sugar dissolves and the lumps disappear and when you're done add about 1 tbsp of the peanut butter mixture on top of the solidified chocolate and now place it in the fridge again for about half an hour to allow the peanut butter mixture to solidify so now for the last step so the peanut butter mixture has solidified and now we are going to pour the last layer of the melted chocolate so this is the remaining chocolate the 2/3 pack of chocolates which I have melted in the microwave and now I'm going to cover the peanut butter with a chocolate and when you're done tap the button a few times to flatten the top of the chocolate now if you still see parts of the peanut butter visible and you need to add more chocolate then go ahead this is why I kept a bigger portion of the chocolate for the top layer because it has to cover the peanut butter completely and it goes down on the sides as well a little bit and now tap it again perfect it's perfectly smooth and flat and now we're going to refrigerate it again for one hour for the chocolate to solidify and then we can eat so this is how easy it is to make peanut butter cups at home it's that easy so now we're ready to eat yay just before we eat them I just want to mention that you could eat them cold out of the fridge directly or you can just leave them at room temperature for a few minutes they'll be a little bit softer and that's how I prefer them mmm amazing you like it mmm Jimmy peanut butter and chocolate it's like the perfect couple in my opinion honestly really good like finger-licking foods okay guys thank you so much for watching this video I really hope you go try these they're so good I mean peanut butter and chocolate can't get better than that so please do give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe bye hi guys welcome to my head and we're I'm trying to like wait it's not actually starting here oh okay doesn't like figure out holding this thing when you like transaction they require three ingredients actually two if you would it's really hot today so hot it made the chocolate melts this is not chocolate chips the right way video yeah bye", "9py2VKu4-Fo": "I've got another great recipe for you I have brought you cheesecake I've brought you protein balls I've brought you everything but here I'm gonna bring you the mothership of the best high-protein recipe today I'm gonna make for you high-protein natural friendly peanut butter cups it doesn't get much better than that these are simple easy you don't have to bake them you're just gonna freeze him a little bit very few ingredients let's get started the first thing you're gonna want to do is have some protein available you're gonna want to do a chocolate protein I'm of course using my MTS way chocolate this is gonna be the chocolate portion of our peanut butter cup so we're gonna use some of that this is optional but what I'm gonna do is also add in some Hershey's unsweetened cocoa if you have the extra dark stuff I would recommend using that it'll just give it more of a chocolaty flavor this is all I have on hand today so that's what I'm going to use though but again if you don't have any on hand you can still just go ahead and use the the chocolate protein and for our filling what I'm going to use is just the peanut butter head laying around today's Smart Balance natural creamy peanut butter use whatever peanut butter you have almond butter really whatever your preference is or for anyone who's competing and maybe you have to watch your fat grams a little bit more there's PB 2 that's also an option you can use in this recipe and just throw that in there instead to kind of save on the fat grams so I'm gonna use the Smart Balance creamy peanut butter and I'm also gonna add it again this is optional you can omit it if you don't like it you hate Walden Farms whatever I like Walden Farms it definitely helps me when I'm cutting so if you haven't checked out their products some of them are a little sketchy and then others are pretty good I do like the Walden Farms caramel dip so I'm gonna add this in with the peanut butter and kind of mix it up that's really it for ingredients guys so what you're gonna want to do is get some type of muffin tin with some liners in it and that's what we're gonna put the peanutbutter cups in to put in our freezer so the first thing we're gonna do I have mixed in a bowl I weighed everything out ahead of time one scoop of mts chocolate whey protein and then I've added in and measured out one tablespoon of the cocoa okay so you're just gonna go ahead and stir that together and what we're gonna do is add a little bit of water at a time to kind of make a sludgy mix in here so what I've done is just kind of portion out a little water you really just want to add a little at a time because for anyone that's made sludge or protein pudding before you know it can go very quick from nice thick and sludgy to watery so we don't want to get it too watery so just add a little bit at a time and stir it up and it always seems like at first you haven't added enough water but you really want to make sure you take enough time to stir it all around it's definitely looking like I'm gonna need to add just a little more water hopefully I don't overdo it so we're gonna use this to do the bottom of my peanut butter cups and we're going to layer layer it and add it to the top as well so that's all ready to go I have measured out in another Bowl two tablespoons of natural peanut butter and about a tablespoon of the Walden's farm caramel dip if your peanut butters really thick it may help if you go ahead and microwave it a little bit this stuff there's that smells really good mixed together actually the caramel with the peanut butter but like I said if you want you could heat it up in the microwave for like 10-15 seconds to get it a little more melty which I'm actually gonna go ahead right now just to make it just to thin it out a little bit it'll make it easier to pour in your peanut butter cups so I went ahead heated that up for 15 seconds and it really does look like the insights to a peanut butter cup so all we're gonna do is go ahead and start layering our peanut butter cups you are working with protein so it gets a little little sticky then what you're gonna do is add peanut butter on top I'm gonna try to even it out a little bit too cuz I want to be able to bite into it and get peanut butter and every little bite okay I'm gonna go ahead and layer it some more chocolate on top this is gonna be so good to actually be able to eat peanut butter cups and not feel as guilty about it it's pretty amazing so this is one of my favorite desserts chocolate and peanut butter is my favorite combo alright so I'm gonna go ahead this should make two peanut butter cups with the amount of ingredients that I added here so go ahead and make as many as you like and then I'm gonna pop these in the freezer for about 30 minutes you're gonna want to let these freeze hey guys I ended up leaving the peanut butter cups in the freezer for about 45 minutes to an hour what I would recommend is that if you have the aluminum foil muffin tends to put it in one of those it was a little tricky getting it out of the the paper muffin holder or whatever but that's okay you can see it's getting a little bit melty so it is gonna melt a little bit once you take it out of the freezer but that's okay because that still tastes delicious the melty chocolate and peanut butter combo so cut a little piece out of it so you could see what it looks like I unfortunately don't have enough macros left today I'm maxed out on my macros but it's not bad at all for you it's high-protein so in one peanut butter cup 17 grams of protein there is 10 grams of fat but you could substitute with pb2 if you want and there's nine and a half carbs so pretty guilt for you know ingredients are going into it and you can plan your day around it so I plan to bring one with me for breakfast tomorrow so yeah it's pretty easy delicious you guys can like switch these up and you know do different flavors if you want but easy way to have a sweet little treat without feeling too guilty so give these a try um don't forget ladies fit got the new machine series get fit tank tops out now so these are at get fit we're gonna fit calm and that's about it guys if you haven't subscribe to me out please head

the video everybody [Music] [Music]", "zSove8JBTc4": "[Music] okay people where are my peanut butter lovers i know you're out there and i can see you so today we're making something super special just for you hi i'm carolyn from all day i dream about food and today we're making easy keto peanut butter bars these bars are the perfect dessert for die hard peanut butter lovers they're super easy to make they don't require any baking and my kids swear they taste just like reese's peanut butter cups so the first thing we're gonna do is take our baking pan a square baking pan you can use nine by nine or eight by eight this one happens to be nine by nine and we're going to line that with either wax paper or parchment paper so our bars don't stick so here i have three quarters cup of butter and i'm going to add three quarters cup of peanut butter and this one is all natural no added sugars and i'm going to show you a little trick for measuring out peanut butter i have my three-quarter cup measure here and i'm going to spray it with a little avocado oil it doesn't really matter what you spray it with and just wipe that around a little and this way the peanut butter will come much more easily out of my measuring cup so i'm just going to scoop my peanut butter into my measuring cup and pack it down as much as i can so i get the full three-quarters cup now we need to melt these together i like to just do it in my microwave but if you don't have a microwave you can always just do it in a pan on the stovetop okay so now my peanut butter and butter are nicely melted together and i'm just going to whisk them up and then i'm going to add my sweetener because this is a no-bake recipe i recommend powdered sweetener and i have half a cup of powdered swerve here and we whisk that in until it's smooth and then we're going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and because my peanut butter was unsalted i like to add just a little salt and now for the magic ingredients i am using peanut flour this one is from anthony's it's roasted and it's partially defatted so it's very powdery and fine a lot of people ask me if you can make this recipe with other flowers like almond flour and you can but almond flour has a lot more moisture in it and so you're going to end up adding a whole lot more than than the peanut flour which can raise the carb count but for today we're using the peanut flour and i have two cups of it here and i'm using a rubber spatula to stir it because you're going to find that it thickens a lot and you really need to work that peanut flour into the mixture so after you've worked in the peanut flour you're going to find that it kind of starts to come together and hold together and it's going to be like one big ball of dough if it doesn't do that you want to add a little more peanut flour at a time until it looks like this then we're going to take our baking pan that we lined with wax paper and we're just going to transfer this big ball of dough into that and we're going to use our hands at first to start pressing it out into the pan and once it's looking pretty even it's still going to have your finger imprints on it so if you really want to smooth it out you take another piece of wax paper or parchment paper put it on top and then take a flat bottomed glass or measuring cup and you can just use that to make it all nice and even and then once they're all smoothed out to your satisfaction you're going to stick them in the fridge to cool while you prepare the chocolate topping so i'm going to add first two tablespoons of butter and then i've got three ounces of lily's dark chocolate here you could use the chips if you prefer and i always just take the squares and break them up and then you just want to stir them until they're nice and melted and smooth and once your topping is nice and smooth and melted grab those bars out of the fridge and pour the chocolate over top and spread it to the edges i like this little offset spatula and make sure you're covering all of your yummy bars with some of the chocolate and i always like to take bars like this and kind of shake them after i've poured the chocolate on so that it evens out the topping now these need to go back in the fridge until the chocolate is completely set which takes about an hour and while you're waiting for those to cool you can always enjoy the chocolate that's left over on your spatula okay peanut butter lovers an hour is up and we are ready to cut into our bars the nice part about lining your pan with with wax paper is that you can just easily lift the whole thing out and it makes it much easier for cutting and i like to take my bench knife but you can use any sharp knife and cut in oh look at that nice and soft and perfect and there we go my friends easy keto no-bake peanut butter bars these are going to be a hit with your whole family for this easy keto recipe and so many more please check out [Music] alldaydreamaboutfood.com", "2MERtHZa_64": "mom and dad are gonna do a blind that taste test the app guns any quest peanut butter cups this one has two grams of protein and this one the quest is specifically protein so it has 20 grams so there's significantly more um the Atkins is 160 calories and the quest has 240 or - the action has 164 - so okay so significantly less calories but this one has significantly more protein so whatever the quest were three dollars and twelve cents at GNC the Atkins were 488 at Walmart so a is going to be that B will be that so I'm gonna set it up and then we'll have mom and dad try it a price observation the Atkins you get five packages in there with that big for 488 like a whole box and the quest you only get that for 312 so significant price difference we'll see which tastes better so remember that a is that and B is that - hold out your hands for a so this is between Atkins and quest okay now let you know beforehand there is a considerable size difference okay don't you hold that is it nasty that's what you thought hey taste up that tastes like it has a like a coffee or something I was being a bitter bitter flavor yeah there is definitely a bitter flavor in there like a coffee like I don't know coffee too but it's a little bitter yeah we're like a burn yeah it's not bad it really was not bad it was it's harder than a Hershey coming out of Reese's right but we're not compared to Wow but yeah it's a little harder but I didn't mind it at all alright so hold your hands out for Big Bertha here oh wow that's heavy I told you considerable size different nuts we're gonna play ball no well I don't think so just like honestly didn't like either one of them gosh that is so and I'm gonna guess that the bees quest yeah me too gosh you're right mess off a is Adkins B is quest that is like taking like cement or chalk something gritty and I can say that we don't like anything quest without peanut butter yeah we never like the adversity but I don't know what they're doing everything you can change the peanut butter manufacturer whatever they're doing their peanut butter is not very good yeah we have now been impressed with the peanut butter we we love the quest bars just to defend ourselves so that we never look bad for quests because we love the bars the s'mores is our very favorite we love the white chocolate raspberry we love a lot of those work these are together no I would not recommend this the Adkins are actually do not mind the evidence I don't like at a bar no I would not I would not but if you're doing the Atkins diet then and you want something slow yeah then I can see why you would buy this definitely if you're on the Atkins diet that would well in the Atkins is a better bang for your buck you get five packages of two for like almost $5 and that one the quest you get like one baggage for like 350 from the calories a big difference yes quest was significantly more but it's Big Bertha like you like looks like the size difference yeah oh yeah it is huge so so I can see why the calories would be there well in all honesty Kevin and I would buy either one of these again but it wasn't about whether we would buy them it's really about whether they taste good to us and as far as these go I truly do believe that there's nothing wrong with the Atkins I think if you're on the Atkins diet you would like these well do you remember what the calories were why not sick I don't know nothing if you're not on the Atkins diet you probably won't want to buy these you can fry it by you're a racist cap but if you're on the Atkins diet then I would recommend these because there's nothing wrong with yeah it's got a funky they had like a BART kind of a bitter coffee flavor to I think I'd rather just buy the mini Ricci cups and portion it out on that and have to get that that's how often - I would rather portion out the good stuff No so this was fun for us and thanks for watching", "E1wmVKu9zyU": "[Music] hey everyone thanks for coming back today we're going to make protein peanut butter cups i make these at least once a week because i love peanut butter cups but i also try to exercise and stay healthy and the store-bought peanut butter cups are filled with processed fats chemically altered sugars and they're just really bad for you and you can never just eat one so i like to have a guilt-free snack so i make these myself if you don't want the added protein all you have to do is substitute our protein powder for confectioners sugar and i'll list all the ingredients in the description so i'm using a powdered peanut butter and this is simply 100 roasted peanuts there's no added salt sugar or anything so i could completely control what goes into it and this also has so much less fat than the store-bought peanut butter but if you don't have this you can use the store-bought peanut butter but i would suggest using a natural peanut butter so i have half a cup here and to make this into peanut butter i'm going to add a little bit of milk and since we're trying to keep this as nutritious as we can i'll use milk instead of water so we're just going to pour a little at a time we don't want our peanut butter to be too runny so we'll add half a teaspoon of salt teaspoon of vanilla and for sweetness i like to put a little bit of honey that's why i just got the pure peanut butter powder because some other brands have a lot of salt and sugar added to it and i like to sweeten it myself i like the flavor of the honey because the honey tastes great has a lot of nice natural antioxidants in it and i'll add my protein powder i'm using vanilla protein powder one measured scoop as the directions on the protein powder the scoop that comes with it now we'll add two tablespoons of ground flax seed flax seed is really good it's a healthy fat has a lot of fiber some more added protein gives it a nice flavor as well and that's our peanut butter mixture so put that aside add one cup of dark chocolate chips with a tablespoon of coconut oil i like the coconut oil because it's a healthy fat and when we melt the chocolate it's going to keep the chocolate from setting too hard and cracking it's going to keep it nice and smooth if you don't have the coconut oil you could use vegetable oil any neutral flavored oil as long as you have that fat to keep the chocolate from cracking when it sets so i'm just going to put this in the microwave in 30 second intervals until it melts all right our chocolate's melted and i have these silicone peanut butter cup molds that i like to use and these are good because they're reusable and since i make these literally once a week it's really great that they're reusable you could use them for other things as well these are great to make quiches in pretty much anything and then these smaller ones are good because you don't have to have the protein in the peanut butter cups you could just make homemade peanut butter cups like i said i'll put all the ingredients in the description these are great for kids my daughter loves these or if you just want a smaller peanut butter cup quick bite-sized one works great i'm gonna do a little bit with both line the bottom with a little bit of chocolate we'll put that in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes so it sets all right our chocolate set so now we'll let our peanut butter filling peanut butter isn't too runny that looks good and we'll do this for the rest all right put that in the freezer for a few minutes let that set we'll cover it with chocolate and finish it up all right so we'll cover these let them set one more time and then we'll be done all right so these guys are nice and set take them out how easily they pop out looks pretty good smaller ones too i actually had to melt a little bit more chocolate because i wanted to show you both molds so i had to make a little bit more looks good so you could store these in the freezer in an airtight container or a ziploc bag so if you're looking for a healthier option than the store-bought processed peanut butter cups these are so easy to make at home these molds work great if you don't have these molds you don't want to pick up these molds just use disposable cupcake liners that'll work as well but i'll link in the description where you can get these molds the powdered peanut butter if you exercise on a regular basis or weight train and you're looking for a guilt-free snack these are great they're sweet you get the extra protein in there from the protein powder a little bit of protein from the milk from the powdered peanut butter and fiber from the ground flax seed and if you're just looking to a better alternative from the store-bought peanut butter cups just replace that protein powder with confectioners sugar you leave out the flaxseed if you want and you got some great tasting homemade peanut butter cups great snack for kids so give these a try give the video a like

going to show you where homemade version of an American candy store classic I've had so many requests for recipes over the years that this one just keeps coming back time and time again I've recently got to actually try the original so now I've been able to reproduce it and I hope you like it it's chocolate peanut butter cups I'm a one pot chef chocolate peanut butter cups I finally understand why the Americans been raving about these so many years I've got to try recently and I'm instantly addicted so here is my homemade version first into the food processor half a cup of icing sugar or confectioners sugar or powdered sugar depending on where you come from two tablespoons of brown sugar 50 grams of butter that's been softened and just chopped up into little cubes and about a hundred grams of beautiful sticky smooth peanut butter now of course you can mix this in a bowl but I find that it's much quicker to do with a food processor because you don't have to sift the icing sugar you know to stand there for ages making sure it's all these graded this way it's done in a few seconds and there we have it it looks just like a big pile of wet sand so leave that aside for the moment and we'll work on the chocolate time to melt the chocolate now I've got a glass bowl sitting over a small amount of simmering water so we're going to use the steam to melt the chocolate and make sure that the water in the glass bowl do not come into direct contact otherwise the chocolate will burn now into the bowl I've added a hundred grams of butter which I've chopped into small bits into that we're also going to add 375 grams of milk chocolate buttons I'm choosing to use milk chocolate you could of course use dark chocolate if that's your personal preference and over this simmering heat we're going to slowly melt the chocolate and butter together everything is melted together and we've got this beautiful thick chocolate goo that's what we're looking for so we're taking this off the heat and let's start assembling we're going to put small amounts of the chocolate mixture into the bottom of each of these little muffin cases or cupcake cases just a small amount just enough to cover the bottom next we're going to work on the peanut butter mixture I'm taking flat teaspoon fulls and I'm just going to flatten them in my hand until you've got a small disc like so and then place it smack dab in the middle of the chocolate mixture and then just gently press down then simply top each one with the remaining chocolate mixture and these are ready to go into the fridge for about five to 10 minutes to allow the chocolate to set and here we have our finished chocolate peanut butter cups and they look absolutely divine they may not be as neat as the mass-produced ones but they taste just as good so let's have a taste mmm peanut butter stickin to the roof of my mouth how good is that I'm got that you beautiful smooth chocolate on the outside and that amazing peanut butter mixture on the inside mm-hmm time for a cup of coffee I think mm-hmm well I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one part chef show comm and until next time see you later", "h4zRN9-vLGc":

cups this is a Whole Foods and these are the chalk or milk chocolate peanut butter cups and they are all day so the Whole Foods peanut butter cups you get four point seven ounces and they were $4.99 the chopped cooler you get twelve ounces and they work 279 so you get more in life for less money oh yeah lots more for a four point seven and twelve five dollars and 279 so big difference but the Whole Foods three pieces are 190 calories and that's 36 grams the all-day the chalk or three pieces 31 grams is 170 so almost the same Graham was weight loss with less calories right the the all the chalk or has a yeah so I'm gonna take these tags off tell me how much they cost Kevin yeah yeah let's see them yeah Kevin doesn't want to see them because he doesn't want to know if there's any difference in them well one might be thicker the other one you know let me thin if there's a huge difference in I can always No was this a can always cut it okay in immediate difference and I can say this if I can't see you this one how one of them is individually right to wonderful medicine so but I didn't look at the packages I don't know which one was which yeah one of them is it is individually wrapped this is how made they look and you know what I'm going to I'm gonna cut these in half because then I'm gonna hold it up to the camera again because I want you to be able to see okay so let me keep it to where there we go so I don't know if that ever a zoomed in or or uh 20 color focus focus I don't know if that ever fast mask actually cut your nose although we can't breathe through your nose okay so this is the first one it's no Reese cup that's for sure okay if you want trying a little bit and just let me now no matter which one did you like the best it's like one which one do you think is holy I don't think that was the whole food one okay all right no all right mm-hmm that's really horrible that's why I said that's it those are the ones that are individually right but they're it's the the stuff inside of its like a pink stop it's not very matte oh and the flavor is just really bad the only thing that has good for it is the chocolate has a good crispy coating it's pretty thick coating of chocolate yeah the bad thing is the chocolates not all that great I'm telling you it so it's definitely the worst of the two now I complained about the second one which is you said that all they do is the all day the peanut butter and it's really runny it's running I mean almost to the point were like a they've added water to it it was it was running yeah very smooshy at least that's what it filled mouthfeel cuz I'm not seeing it I don't know it was running yeah it's running no no it's it's a little too squishy for me texture wise yes I wish there's a little thicker because it's like a Reese's peanut butter was kind of gritty yeah and it's it's not as pasty is that whole food yeah it's at least thicker the whole foods I'm telling you if no more things that you'd be so disappointed over people to pay $5 if they love those and they have had any other kind in a long time if you like these then you can't possibly have had a racist cap in it there's no there's no way because if you bought a bag of these and you bought a bag of the races that are the miniature cups that are individually ripe like this - there's no way you would want to eight things I don't know why anyone would chose like but it's not good even the pin bones are good the texture is not good there is nothing good about that bad armor whereas these it is amazing how many you get for the money and they're good they're not as good as a reason they're still not yeah there's still not racist I would rather spend the money and go ahead and buy the Rings yeah go buy a big bag of the reason even if you don't get as many races for me even though these are better than the whole foods for me I don't compromise on some things and for me it's not worth compromising because I like peanut butter too much to compromise on my peanut butter yeah but I'm here at all and you want a peanut butter cup that's pretty decent that's not bad no and if you have a big family if you have a lot of kids or whatever and in sweet treat for me yeah then then I do think then this is a good option for you and but if I'm gonna go enjoy some some sweet treat I don't want that I don't have waste

Reese's peanut butter cups so we have peanut butter flavor we have chocolate cake we've got chocolate ganache we have some chocolate sprinkles that'll give a little bit of crunch but the flavors all

I'm gonna put some dollops all around the top and now we can put a border on here now for the best part of this entire cake the only reason I'm actually made this cake was for the Reese's peanut butter cups that we're gonna put on top of it so I have a bunch here and what I'm gonna do is cut these in half I'm gonna take some more of these Reese's and I'm just gonna chop them up and then we're

"p2rYGHVsZtI": "what's up everybody the holiday seasons are upon us what does that mean we have halloween thanksgiving christmas and we get to do kick-ass cocktails that represent each one of them i am super stoked guys clearly if you've seen the thumbnail i clearly have never made this cocktail before so i'm pretty stoked for it it involves a couple of my favorite things uh one being alcohol and two being reese's pieces reese's peanut butter crop it's the best halloween candy if you're going out there and you're expecting like gumdrops or like chiclets or something you're crazy because it's all about the reese's peanut butter cups put them like eggs put them like christmas trees i don't care it's halloween let's do this this is the drunken peanut butter cup let's get after it first thing we need is we're gonna go ice into our shaker here i for some reason only have my big ice today so that's okay yeah i know people pretty great so after this we have our you have to pre-make this so this is just straight up vodka infused with reese's pieces um i put it overnight i let it sit it looks really gross kind of and brown but i promise you that's that's all it is so let's go ahead and let's measure out three ounces with my [ __ ] there it is so we're gonna go out and a half and an ounce and a half perfect plenty left over for something i'll probably also never use next you're gonna go with your milk i didn't specify in the recipe uh which milk to use so i just went white milk because i was afraid it was gonna be maybe too chocolatey overpowering so again another three ounces and then lastly we have our liqueur here so uh chocolate cream uh it doesn't really matter just some sort of a creamy liqueur that you want to put in here again i went more with the i think this is just irish cream here uh so i'm just gonna go with that and we're going just two ounces of this glug glug it says a lot of booze up in there okay i am so excited it smells so peanut buttery i'm super excited got the shaker here let's go ahead and give her a good shake [Applause] okay here's the fun part people we gotta decorate our glass up a little bit it's halloween everything's got to have a costume on it so get your best [ __ ] glass whether it's uh you know a margarita glass a martini glass doesn't matter i just went with the margarita glass here um you're going to rim it like you would rim a margarita though except instead of using simple syrup you're going to use peanut butter i know i can already hear you guys peanut butter that's crazy oh my god that all right i could just leave it like that it looks amazing uh next thing we're gonna do i'll move my shaker out of the way here get a little bag of reese's pieces where's my oh here's my hammer and we're gonna beat the piss out of it we're done beating it all up and we have all of our reese's pieces smashed up here on a nice plate so now we're gonna take our rimmed peanut butter glass and we're just gonna just like you would salt we're gonna go ahead and just get it nice and stuck up against you you might have to get your fingers a little messy and that's okay go ahead oh i'm excited to flip this i am so excited oh my god look at that thing oh so i might get a couple pieces ball but that's okay it's worth it all right next we're just gonna go ahead and we're gonna pour our concoction here over the top into our glass oh yeah just a nice creamy rich looking cocktail oh oh so good and then last but not least the peace day resistance is you are going to garnish it with an actual reese's peanut butter cup what better could you ask for in a cocktail so you're gonna try and cut it without splitting it oh my goodness people and there you have the drunken peanut butter cup oh i love it i am so excited to try this oh that is so good you get your peanut butter flavor but it's not overpowering the i think honestly i'm so i'm really glad to go with the chocolate liqueur it just went with this i think the chocolate curd be very good but the irish cream itself does just enough for it that it's so smooth so rich and it tastes just like a peanut butter cup oh my god i'm so happy about that way this turned out

didn't like very much at all sleep to me it tastes like that's one quicksave but as its developed it's more development like a sunflower seed con flavor which is not P letter it tastes like sunflower seeds so our curls and pumpkin seeds that's exactly what it tastes like all right Harger it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't have pumpkin in defense I'm sure it does because that's exactly what it tastes like somewhere in the 50 ingredients it listed yeah yeah but I like that flavor quite a bit okay I'm surprised it's that strong milk any on the first ingredients peanut butter the dark chocolate has 7 grams of protein hmm yeah I like the door problem better you doing we're too much alike well yes because you can all really taste the chocolate you can you could really get the chocolate flavor and that salt add something to that yes yeah it's dark chocolate with sea salt I should have said that dirt Rosie's oh yes yes that is an excellent chocolate I want I like both bars but in other two they really takes more like a sunflower in the milk chocolate you really tasted the pumpkin seeds some horror say that's the flavor even if it doesn't have them that's what it that's what it comes to as you really tasted that strong the dark chocolate the chocolate is this shine that that's what shines in this bar the chocolate the dark chocolate in the sea salt are very very good I like both of these okay both of them when I first link said when I first poem elements like it tastes a little funky like strange but then it develop the flavors developing this sunflower seed company which is really good I actually like that if you stick your tongue on the side I've just got salt yeah I get I got tons of salt boom I love that it's the best thing that's put they they almost did it call them someone that could have made him my brother I guess they do win the biggest thing well I'm wondering it says peanut butter it does say feel better did you know what it has sunflower oh yeah mm-hmm you cuz you can taste that but these are different yes these are very very good they might even have them in our stores and I just haven't seen them so Sarah's really good at finding things that we haven't reviewed on the channel so just I guess you would look in the refrigerator I we have tried some perfect bars before and I've seen perfect bars I know all they sells them all kinds of stores so I think Whole Foods even sell so many Walmart Walmart has a more limited availability of the flavors but I don't think I've seen the peanut butter cups so if you haven't tried them I would definitely recommend giving these crops good for you like some foxy yeah so I'll have a picture for at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "Iw4aWu77_0I": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "eN1l9zEeLcQ": "what's up guys welcome to another video this has been a video that I have been trying to make for over a month now if you guys are familiar with my channel you know that I have been going on a lot of missions and searching everywhere to try to find this and last night was finally the night that had happened this is the Reese's Peanut Butter International delight creamer now this video is not sponsored I have just been a huge fan of this candy basically my entire life so when they came out with the Kramer I'm like I gotta have it because guess what also was my favorite coffee so you know I got to do a taste test I went to two different targets yesterday and before that when it was first announced it was Walmart exclusive I believe so I went to two or three different Walmart's in the Los Angeles area which Walmart's are kind of far away from me so I have spent probably about five hours maybe more just trying to search for this now you're probably like why didn't you just check the site or why didn't you call them now I did I called the stores I checked the sites but I just I didn't believe them and some of the stores said that they had it in stock so I went and it was there but guys it doesn't matter because right now we're gonna be doing a taste test of the Reese's Peanut Butter International delight creamer now I have the candy for reference just for reference you know in case I forget what it tastes like although yesterday in the drive home for my car I was stuck in traffic and I'm like I'll just like open a bag and eat some of these it was a really hot day even though I had the air conditioned on I was like eating these and driving that it kept getting all over my hands so then I was trying to like wipe it off then it was all over the steering wheel and then I dropped one and he was all over the seat basically my car it smells delightful but there's chocolate smeared everywhere okay we're gonna get right to it let's see yeah let's see what the ingredients are in this baby calories 35 per tablespoon I put a lot in here protein none carbs 5 grams total sugar 5 grams of sugar 4 tablespoons water cane sugar yeah it doesn't actually matter you guys were so sweet everyone was tweeting me and commenting and telling me like Jenna I got it I got it here you should go check here or go check there which finally someone tweeted me yesterday and said they found it in a target in California and that is how this all happened so thank you very much much appreciated we got to try it I'm like dying on the inside let's go I'm supposed to shake it shake well this is such a big day I guess I should probably open it first huh it smells just like the candy wonder what it tastes like should I drink it should I drink it when you take what you want to taste it I'm shooting at Matt's apartment because he has better lighting at this time of day and I also like that there's an exercise bike in the background while I am filming a video of candy I'm gonna drink it here goes this is gonna be good whatever oh my goodness that tastes good have you guys ever had the Reese's cereal you know the little balls so if I were to give this an accurate description of the taste test oh my gosh it's everywhere I would say but it would taste like the racy cereal after the milk has been sitting on it for a long time if you were to drink that milk that is what this tastes like does that make sense it does in my head okay here we go let's try and copy I just I mean I wonder how sick I would get 63 servings not the way I pour alright baby let's use a taste test cut to that slow-mo pour [Music] here we go [Music] it's funny because I actually had a coffee already this morning and I wanted to use the creamer but I didn't want to open it because I want to taste it first on film so I have a my usual Vanilla creamer but honestly this tastes basically just like a chocolate creamer I don't really taste any like peanut butter in here but when I drank it straight from the bottle it kind of tasted better so I can't tell if my coffee is bad or if it's just the taste I'm a little indifferent it's not bad it's just not what I thought it was gonna be but like I said it could be the coffee it could be it just tastes like chocolate creamer I've had chocolate creamer before realistically I probably would not be using this everyday maybe like what for like a special treat but I probably would stick to my normal Vanilla creamer it's so weird because when I smell it I drink it from the bottle it's great I should probably eat one to see just to make sure I'm not messing up my taste oh no it's dark I also bought two of these and these are the big boys - he's not the small ones so I think I'm gonna have creamer for a long time hopefully because it took me forever to find it and you can't order it online because it's dairy and it wasn't available I I have no idea I'm a little underwhelmed but I'm still excited that I got to try it and I will still drink it but not everyday because that probably is not probably not good for you so that's kind of all we have for this taste test a little underwhelming I must say still good literally tastes like the milk at the bottom of the Reese's cereal if it was sitting and getting saturated and soaked up if you drink that that's what it would kind of taste like if you guys have tried it what do you think it tastes like alright guys thank you so much for watching let me know if there's any other taste tests you want me to do and let me know if you have tried the creamer if you've liked it and what you think it tastes like I gotta go look at all of this candy I have the best bye guys thanks for watching what do I do now [Music] [Applause]", "DrSRyvCfUlo": "peanut butter cup rice krispies treats hello everyone first thing you're gonna do is open or MRAP 24 Reese's peanut butter cups and make sure you remove the little paper liners now at the store that I bought these out it was cheaper actually to get them in stock sizes that day so that's why they're all individually wrapped set those aside and move on to the next part of the recipe that's 7 cups of miniature marshmallows into that we're gonna add 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I'm using creamy but you could use chunky as well now I put this in the microwave for about 2 minutes until the marshmallows are nice and puffy and melted and the butter and peanut butter have also melted and you're gonna stir that together until it's nice and smooth if you don't want to use a microwave you can do this in a large pot over low heat on the stove as well now add in 7 cups of rice krispies cereal and stir it until the cereal is completely coated and then you're gonna take half of that cereal and put it in the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch greased baking dish and then spread it out using a buttered spatula or your fingers that have been lightly dampened with water and they won't stick at all spread that out and quickly add your peanut butter cups you're gonna spread them out evenly over the surface of that first half of the rice krispies treats work fairly quickly because the rice krispies treats set up pretty fast now take the second portion of the mixture and place it on top of the peanut butter cups and gently spread it out and Pat it down until it's nice and smooth using your fingers or a buttered spatula now we're gonna make a great topping that is a 1 and a half cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and an additional 2 tablespoons of peanut butter I put this in the microwave for about a minute to a minute and a half until it was melted stirred it all together and then you're gonna spread it on top of your cereal bars then put it in the refrigerator and allow it to set completely before you cut it into squares and if you love peanut butter and chocolate as much as I do you will love these rice krispies treats they are delicious lots of great peanut butter flavor and great hits of chocolate Rice Krispies cereal is such a versatile ingredient and there's so many great recipes that you can make with it I've done so many of them but I've put them on a Rice Krispies cereal base treats playlist if you want to see it go ahead and click right on your screen look for the link in the description box or check out the little eye on your screen they'll take you to the playlist thank you for watching bye bye", "0-i64LdcFh0": "hey guys it's Kristen from a mindful mom [Music] we're gonna be making homemade peanut butter cups and as you can tell Leila is super excited but what's not to love peanut butter cups are the best creation in my opinion I just love chocolate and peanut butter together don't you mm-hmm I don't know many people who don't but we're going to show you how easy it is to make this treat at home with healthier ingredients first thing we have a muffin tin and then we have these little silicone liners that we're gonna put our chocolate in and when the chocolate cups come out they're gonna look just like race teacups right okay and those are super affordable we use them for baking we use them for little lunch box dividers in our lunch boxes right you use them all the time and Leila picked the pretty fun colors for today right okay next thing we need to melt our peanut butter no no we don't need them out peanut butter do we yeah what do we need to melt Jack we need to melt chocolate yes chocolate now we're gonna show you our hack for melting chocolate or tempering chocolate at a low temperature to get perfectly melted chocolate and that's using a slow cooker so easy this is gonna change melting chocolate at home for the good trust me so much easier than the microwave and almost as quick all right so you take a glass jar and then you're gonna put half way full with chocolate chips you can use any chocolate chips you like dark chocolate chips milk chocolate chips dairy free chocolate chips you could even use white chocolate chips and I think she's made I'm gonna be over there with my hand motions good so you can even use white chocolate if you want it sometimes we chopped up like chocolate bars and we use those as well or we chopped up what else left over Easter candy these kids are known to get those big giant chocolate Easter bunnies and we just can't eat all of them so what we do is we chop up that chocolate and we use it in chocolate chip cookies to melt and to make these homemade raised knee cups and of course they eat some right they connect pretty much the whole bunny she wishes yeah she she does need a good portion of it all right so once you have your chocolate in your ball jar you're gonna place in your slow cooker and then you're gonna fill your slow cooker up with water till it's about half way around the ball jar so just covering the chocolate you're going to turn your slow cooker on to high and then you're going to let this melt giving it a stir every 10 minutes or so and it'll take 20 minutes up to 30 minutes so yes it does take a little bit of time but the chocolate melts perfectly by the magic of TV we already have one in here melts it you want to make sure not to get any water inside this jar because that will cause your chocolate to seize up or get hard and yucky so to this chocolate melted chocolate we're gonna add in one tablespoon of coconut oil the coconut oil we're just going to stir that in the coconut oil is going to help keep this chocolate nice and smooth and really um able for us to be able to spread it super easy it's gonna set up in the fridge or the freezer so it's it's gonna make these peanut butter top perfect all right once that's done know what we're gonna do because I'm gonna pull this out of the slow cooker I'm going to use a towel to kind of dry it off so we don't risk getting any chocolate on our or any water into our chocolate I know she's lying it and now what we're gonna do is we're just going to take a little mini cookie scooper just like this and we're gonna take our chocolate and we're gonna pour in just one scoop of chocolate you're gonna do is you're gonna roll the chocolate around just to form that bottom face if you would like your chocolate to go up the sides evenly you could take a little spoon and just kind of rub it up just a tiny bit like a quarter of an inch Leila would you like to do that yeah okay while Leila is doing that I'm gonna put our chocolate back into the slow cooker to keep it warm while we wait for the bottom of our homemade peanut butter cups to set up we're gonna put these in the freezer we're gonna set them up for about five minutes and then we're going to come back and put peanut butter on top of the hardened chocolate okay all right chocolate has set up in the freezer nicely it takes about five minutes you can pop it in the fridge and it'll take about five to ten minutes from there so whichever way you prefer now we're gonna scoop some peanut butter on to our chocolate all right we're gonna use the same little scooper I've washed and dried it and then we're just gonna take one scoop of peanut butter each and put it right in the middle right now Leila is just kind of giving the peanut butter a little spread and the chocolate mmm Leila how's it smell like she wants to eat it right now mm-hmm she's doing a good job bread in that peanut butter it doesn't have to be perfect does it what do you think she's been pretty good go ahead who can I mean who can deny a child looking peanut butter I can't ever not like it okay what's the best to the site now what we're gonna do is all you have to do is take your chocolate back out and wipe it down so you don't want to get any what in our chocolate one does okay and then all you're gonna do is you're just gonna take a tiny little bit of chocolate and pour it on the top and then you're gonna spread it out gently spread the chocolate really doesn't need much spreading it's so perfectly melted that it just covers the peanut butter perfectly on it mmm the great thing about leaving this chocolate and the slow cooker is that it gets it stays perfectly melted from the beginning to the end yes that one needs a little bit more this one yet this one needs a little bit more and if you were to run out of chocolate just pop a few more chocolate chips in here you can even do that after your chocolate let's say you make the base of your chocolate peanut butter cups and you're like oh I'm getting pretty low on chocolate while your peanut butter cups are setting up add some more chocolate chips to this leave it in your slow cooker and let them melt as your base that's only two more what do you think should we share these with the boys in her house or do you think we should not tell them that we made them she's so nice isn't she - god she's here holding me accountable because I probably wouldn't be very nice okay yes use that spoon spread that out Oh Leila these look perfect don't thank you you need me first chocolate our first peanut butter and now chocolate I guess go ahead okay now we're gonna put these back in the freezer or the fridge for five to ten minutes let them set out and we're gonna show you what they look like in just a minute all right our peanut butter cups are ready we are so so excited and this took no time at all so Leila why don't you get one out here guys look it just pops out so perfectly just like that it looks like a peanut butter it really does okay so what you're going to want to do is you're going to restore these in the refrigerator because they will know if you leave them at room temperature and that's because we don't have all those preservatives and stabilizers that you find and store by Ricci cups or peanut butter cups so I think that I don't know you licked the spoon or the spoon you lick the knife maybe I should be the one to try it yes all right we'll let you try it go ahead take a little bite and you describe the flavors to us it is like you just bought out with store-bought Reese's Cups and been into it you can hear that she's got that peanut butter stuck to the roof of her mouth she needs a glass of milk you guys thank you so much for joining us in the kitchen again we're showing you some healthy treats some not so healthy treats but all together things that kids love and they can make in the kitchen with you so thanks so much for joining us and be sure to join us again next week when we're back here in the kitchen making up something delicious and now I'm going to eat the rest of this", "OsUiNQ35a-0": "move over minis I'm all about making my favorite peanut butter cup giant there's been a long-standing debate about what goes better with peanut butter jelly or chocolate well my vote is definitely with chocolate I mean it just makes sense pairing luxurious sinfully delicious chocolate with creamy roasted peanut butter it's like a match made in heaven and if I'm going to make my own Reese's peanut butter cups you best believe we're super sizing them here's what you need dark chocolate peanut butter powdered sugar and an 8 inch round tart pan this recipe is so easy the first thing that you want to do is take your tart pan and just line it with some plastic wrap on the bottom and on the top so that the chocolate doesn't go through this pan right here alright so I've already melted my candy melts in the microwave and I'm gonna start by pouring a little bit of the chocolate into my tart pan so you just want to tilt the pan and rotate it slowly so that chocolate coats all the way up the sides did you know that there's a substance in chocolate called phenylethylamine it's the same stuff that your body produces when you're in love hmm maybe I should make more of these for mr. amazing now we're just going to pop this into the refrigerator for about five to 10 minutes or until the chocolate hardens now we're going to repeat this process one more time so that we have a nice thick layer of chocolate and then we're going to save the rest of this for the top this is really important because we don't want all that yummy peanut butter filling popping out the sides do we now I'm just gonna pop this back into the refrigerator so while that's setting up we're gonna make our creamy peanut butter filling super simple just creamy peanut butter and then we're gonna slowly incorporate our powdered sugar and the powdered sugar is what's going to give us that crumbly soft texture that you get from a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup my chocolate shells nice and hard now I'm just gonna pour our creamy peanut butter filling into the show oh my god this is such a giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and then just using my spoon I'm gonna make this nice and even now I'm not going to forgetting the rest of this off the spoon so I'm going to eat this later I'm going to pour the rest of the chocolate into the giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup oh my gosh this is so cool then I'm just going to use the back of the spoon to push all that chocolate to the edge give it a little shake to get rid of any air bubbles and then this little baby or her big baby is going back in the fridge one last time oh my God look how fantastic this is did you know that when Reese's peanut butter cups were first introduced in 1928 they were called penny cups because they cost a penny well I wonder how much this big mama would have cost back then I cannot wait to take a bite oh come to mama oh my gosh this is amazing so our Reese's but this tastes way better than the original I don't know if I want to share whoo guys thanks so much for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a thumbs up and subscribe to pop sugar food and I would love to know if you're gonna take on the challenge to make a giant peanut butter cup I'm Randy and I'll see you next time bye you gonna let the fennel ethyl panel mess body print outfit Sena left a little minimal phenylethylamine did I get it it's the same substance that your body creates when your love", "BJba4Yf9Y_Q": "if you're an experienced fan of the Reese's chocolate peanut butter cup you know when you get a fresh one right away it's got that wonderful chocolate scent when you open it up and it's shiny and not discolored on the top you pull off that bottom wrapper and nothing sticks to it and when you take a bite oh man that peanut butter is so smooth and moist and sugary and sweet but you also know how disappointing it is when you get a stale one you take a bite and it tastes kind of like cardboard ugh so what do you need to do to get a fresh Reese's Peanut Butter Cup every time you buy one news for shoppers investigated and we've got all the details right after the click hi I'm Chris Andrews with news for shoppers Hershey's the company that makes the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup used to have a system where the expiration date was embedded in code on the back of the package it was not very consumer friendly they have a much better system now with a best buy date clearly on the back of the package that's as good as far as it goes though but it doesn't really tell you how fresh the Reese's peanut butter cups are it just tells you when the last possible moment is that they're still good we contacted Hershey's to ask exactly what the time period was from when they're manufactured to the best by date they would not disclose that information they stayed very tight-lipped about it so it was up to us to figure it out so we went from store to store candy out a candy aisle on a search to find the freshest peanut butter cups available of course lots of taste testing was required we focused primarily on the miniatures the to cut package the four cup package and the big cup Reese's we found that in most cases the freshest we could find had a best by date of ten to eleven months into the future that made us suspect that the timeframe from the manufacture date to the best by date was one year it took more hunting but we did finally strike gold when we found a 12-pack with the best by date exactly one year away from the car date this was at a Walmart and it was on sale just a dollar 50 for 12 cups and the cups on that one with a Best Buy date a year away were the freshest we found so if you're looking for the freshest Reese's peanut butter cups you can find based on our research it looks like that Best Buy date needs to be a year into the future or very close the closer you can get to it being a year in the future the fresher your peanut butter cups are going to be the one thing that Hershey's did share with us is that storage conditions do play a factor in how fresh the peanut butter cups stay so if there's high humidity or high heat of course that's going to affect the Hershey peanut butter cups so you're looking at your bigger store outfits the ones with good inventory control to keep the products fresh if you're buying from a mom-and-pop outfit with the inventory out in the shed

"hello welcome to our show with colleen ballinger and car you to soda tea tea hey Corinne do you ever just a Reese's Pieces all the time I don't have me at home wait a minute I think I'll whip some up stop me on Easter Sunday and call me Howard this is honestly like such an easy recipe all you need is chocolate chips powdered sugar graham crackers peanut butter salt and a little mini muffin pan so I put the full recipe down below but I'm only gonna make a half rest because I ain't no fatty and I'm not gonna eat it all Hospital all you do is you put them in the microwave for like 30 seconds at a time and stir it every time don't burn it because if you burn it it won't pour it nice and smoothly that skin and who likes burnt chocolate dogs I knew it there's our we're waiting for the chocolate to melt dancer Wow the chocolate chips are melting in the microwave what you can do is super mini muffin pan I've already done it but you spray it with Pam all right them so that the chocolate chips come out or the chocolate peanut butter cups come out smoothly when you're all finished so it should look like this mmm do they have to bring me fingers before the chocolate into these old tanks it's like a little glob like about a tablespoon of chocolate per tin and then you're gonna take something like the end of a spoon or a knife or something and make sure it gets all around the edges so that the chocolate is completely layering hold the whole thing that's gonna be the outer shell Michaels at the store get any wine for us right now so there's globs of peanut chocolate in there and I'm just I don't know if you can see this but I'm just swishing the chocolate and you put it in the freezer so that I can chill and harden in place I love it when things get hard [Music] Scorpio now we're going to mix everything else together is just so making the filling yes and I'll I guess all the measurements are down below it makes a really nice crunchy texture inside of the peanut butter section putting the microwave for like 10 20 seconds so the peanut butter melted at Easter [Music] it doesn't take long for the chocolate to harden so as long as it takes to melt the peanut butter the chocolate should be ready that's convenient all right so now you just fill up the peanut butter cups with your chocolate what's your peanut butter filling well I'm doing that will you fill this up you need to melt more chocolate for the top [Music] you should put like this much peanut butter in each cup this is what it looks like it doesn't have to be perfect because it will all settle down when you cut the chocolate so hot trust over that so we're just putting these little blobs on top and make sure it's totally covered totally covered up the peanut butter well the peanut butters cover it up put it back in the freezer for like 10-15 minutes and then they're done no baking easy peasy lemon squeezy they're finished let's check it out in the freezer today that's what they look like you're

melted all right so we're almost done mixing out the peanut butter and [Music] and I'm gonna add one more three now we're gonna stir that together and now we're gonna add your sweet so this is keto friendly I'm using the Truvia and you're to use about 2 to 4 tablespoons of like actual sweetener so for the trivia I just be using two packets so now we're adding that trivia so the Truvia actually has zero sugars it has stevia and erythritol I believe it's right there we go now we stir that and to end if you would night you just add a dash of vanilla so I'm patting literally a splash of vanilla and then you're gonna transfer it to my bowl so I'm able to go ahead and set it so most individuals use silicone molds but I don't have any so what I'm gonna use is actually mini cupcake molds and then we're gonna put them in the freezer to set they look like mini Reese's butter cups now you don't want to fill it all the way to the top well you can if you really want to I just choose not to at this time whoo-hoo so they're done these are the chocolate peanut butter keto fat bombs and now what I'm gonna do is actually remove the wrapping and put them in a mason jar for storage I hope you

in white chocolate it is the Reese peanut butter cup I've never ever tried this is that first for me I've never had a recipient butter cup in white chocolate I don't even know if they sell it in Canada I've never seen it in a store I bought this at the candy shop just north or really I got a lot of imported chocolate from different places all over the world so this is about 42 grams a hunt 1.5 ounces that's the size of the bar obviously the weight calories is 220 calories and this is made by the Hershey Company in the United States of America so let's open this up check it out first time ever seeing a Risa cup in white chocolate look at that is not a strange sight all your life you've seen the peanut butter cups and regular milk chocolate now it's in white so for all you white chocolate lovers out there this is a new one let's break this in half see if it's any different from normal because I should have bought a regular going to show you the difference but most of you probably have had the regular probably never have had the white I'm not sure when they invented this or decided to make this because I again I've never seen it before so let's give it a shot the peanut flavor of the filling is so overpowering I can't taste the white chocolate it's going to take another quick bite other just a white chocolate now so it's a really good white chocolate but when you eat the whole thing I can't even tell the difference probably between a regular one and a regular what milk chocolate and the white chocolate well anyway guys there you go there's your Reese's

Cup for the first time on national YouTube here we go it was really good I never would have got to be that good so there you go my first trending video I'm gonna hit a million in no time", "zfg-Pj3KIg8": "today I'm going to be some really yummy chocolate peanut butter cups and you won't how easy these are I've got a half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips a quarter cup of peanut butter an eighth of a cup of powdered sugar that is also called confectioner sugar or icing sugar and just some paper molds three simple ingredients so let's get started so the first thing I've done is I've microwaved my chocolate on the defrost mode and now I'm just going to fill our little paper cups I just want to give them one little layer of chocolate each so I'm going to start filling these up I'll come back in a second when this is done okay so eyeball it and try to get them all even then I just gotta knock it down that will just help level out our chocolate and now into the fridge just to chill this down for about 10 minutes or so while our chocolate is chilling in the fridge we're just going to mix both of these together in a bowl so this is a quarter cup of peanut butter and 1/8 of a cup of confectioner's sugar also called icing sugar or powdered sugar it's all the same sugar okay and then our sugar and then we'll just slowly start incorporating this the icing sugar is just going to make our peanut butter mixture a little bit more sweet I'll switch over to the back of a fork just to show you you can see the fork is allowing me to push a lot harder so whatever works for you just use that technique so what I've done here is I just put this in the microwave for about 15 seconds just to loosen this up because I do want to put this into a piping bag which I have here ready to go so I'm going to fill that with our peanut butter mixture and then we're going to apply that to our first layer of chilled chocolate so we have our children and now I've got my peanut butter icing sugar mixture in the bag and we're just going to simply pipe out a layer on top of each one of the chocolates okay that looks pretty good just like that but once again you just want to tap it so that everything gets nice and level and now we're going to pop this into the fridge again I just want this to chill up a little bit before we add our final layer of chocolate so these are been in the fridge for about 20 minutes or so and if I touch them they're actually quite solid which is perfect so I've reheated my chocolate and now we're just going to add that to the top and I'm just going to split this up into four and if you do run out of chocolate just zap a little bit more in your microwave on the defrost mode but this is perfect for this size recipe these are quite large so if you use smaller little molds you're going to get you know quite a few more and once again just kind of tap these to get it all nice and even look at that perfect our last step we'll pop these into the fridge 15 20 minutes then we'll come back and I'll unmold one and show you the final product so our beautiful chocolate peanut butter cups have fully chilled now I'll just remove them from here you can hear how nice and solid they are if I tilt one up you can see the nice layers here so we've got our chocolate then our peanut butter and then the chocolate on top and I know what you're saying right now you're saying I can hardly see zoom in okay no problem alright there's a nicer closer look and you can see the nice layers there so let's open one of these up look at that doesn't that look amazing Wow really really nice you know whoever eats these they're going on really really like this so let's cut into our beautiful chocolate peanut butter cup and I'll just show you what it looks like inside look at that really really nice so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish that's it for today and I'll see you next time you",

"rS5NNWwFCxA": "[Music] good afternoon guys and welcome back to my very baking and welcome back to another little kind of Christmassy junk food review type thing today we are talking about a truly truly ridiculous product now we have reviewed some other ridiculous products on the channel before which I'm sure you can find if you scroll back through the archives but today we're really topping off the kind of gluttony scale today we are talking about the ultimate Christmas gift for the peanut butter lover in your life the just the tip-top apex predator of peanut butter gifts we're talking about the half pound Reese's peanut butter cups so for any fellow European viewers 1 pound of Reese's peanut butter cups is about 450 grams that's half a kilo almost of Reese's peanut butter cups so I think this was about 7 or 8 pounds which honestly for the novelty is actually quite good of hunger you to me I can link the websites down below but I find them if for any reason you're unfamiliar with a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup it's essentially a kind of sweetened peanut butter cream filling inside some kind of cheap quite terrible American milk chocolate but no one's really here for the chocolate I am really fascinated to see the kind of ratio of peanut butter to chocolate in this thing and to see if I could even stomach eating half of one of these so let's get into it so as with a standard Reese's Peanut Butter Cup these do come jesus H Christ that is ridiculous so they come in the standard kind of cardboard tray and on this this is your peanut butter cup oh my good golly gosh so while these are normally kept in a kind of paper cup this needs some plastic to support the sheer kind of thick booty that is on this thing it is deep it's actually quite kind of sturdy for the size I thought it would be kind of cool I'm saying under the weight of itself and it actually has quite a pretty pattern on the underside there obviously all I can smell is peanut butter with a kind of undertone of cheap milk chocolate let's cut into this thing and see what it looks like oh my god okay okay okay okay this is what half a pound of Reese's Peanut Butter Cup looks like that is a dangerous amount of peanut butter so this is just half of one of these again it's so heavy obviously all you can smell is peanut butter this thing is dense there are no gaps here this is just full unadulterated peanut butter in a fairly generous milk chocolate shell yeah I'm gonna stop talking and I just need to take a bite out of this thing because it looks absolutely insane here we go half a pound of Reese's Peanut Butter Cup this is utterly ridiculous in the most delicious way because it's a mass-produced American milk chocolate it's quite trash but the peanut butter filling is so so peanutty is so rich so delicious I really don't know who this is marketed at I don't know if it's supposed to become some kind of family shading dessert I don't know if it's supposed to be just some kind of super ridiculous movie snack I don't know if it's just dinner when you're on your period I really don't know who this is aimed at and as much as a kind of symbol of capitalist gluttony that it is I can't help but kind of love it I'm kind of one more though that could just be the hydrogenated core instead of talking obviously it is very sweet it's very rich but there is also a little bit of kind of saltiness and savoriness from those peanuts it does just make you want to come back again and again and again until you've eaten a pound of them but we're not gonna do that today because I have other things to do today that aren't just lying in the chocolate corner it's completely absurd its excessive its decadent its over-the-top but when we are in the midst of the Christmas season which is about absurdity excess decadence everything I think this fits in perfectly I think this would be a great novelty gift if you have a peanut butter lover in your life it's obviously not the best thing you're ever gonna eat it's obviously not of the highest quality but it's fun it's not too expensive and it's definitely gonna make someone smile overall as ridiculous as this is and the fact that I haven't even eaten like one twentieth of the product itself I'm gonna give this a 4 out of 5 if you guys have ever tried these giant Reese's peanut butter 1/2 pound cups let me know in the

recipes that people say are really good to see if they're really as good as they say now the recipe just calls for two ingredients the first ingredients is frosting you know the canned frosting it calls for 16 ounces or 1 pound same measurement of each peanut butter and the frosting now if you're in Canada our frosting comes in 450 which is about 16 ounces but our peanut butter comes in 500 grams so I'm just gonna leave a little bit of this still in the jar and use all of this so you just open it up now you can use whatever you want to you can use the vanilla I have heard that some people have tried it with the the cream cheese frosting but today we are using the milk chocolate the vanilla it makes it taste just like plain peanut butter but I wanted the peanut butter chocolate flavoring because I love Reese's peanut butter cups so hopefully this tastes something sort of similar to that okay this is messy licking it off my fingers folks because I didn't think put anything beyond on the tablecloth so I can't exactly put this down to clean it off now we're not going to put all of this in here now some of the ones you'll see they put these can the containers individually in the microwave for a minute each we're not going to do that because these containers are not listed as microwave safe and I don't want any sort of chemicals leaching into the fudge so I'm just gonna put both of them see I'm leaving some still in there because we want 50 grams but in there and so I'm just gonna kind of mix this a little bit and it's gonna go in the microwave since we've never made this one before I'm gonna tell you how long we put it in obviously microwaves vary but it'll give you an idea so this will probably take two minutes and it gets very liquidy and runny so we'll see you then okay so this has been in the microwave for two minutes and it looks done so all you're going to do is make sure that this is thoroughly mixed up together doesn't appear to be any lumps or chunks and once it is you just put it in a baking pan I lined mine with wax paper which I do for pretty well all the fudge I make I usually like to line it but I usually do mine in like little loaf pans my fudge so you can slice it like you see it at the fairs and that but this one didn't look like I'd have enough for a loaf pan so I'm just putting it in this one I'm gonna move this to all the corners and I'm just gonna give it a to settle it down and then this goes in the fridge now times vary some people say it's ready in an hour some say - you're just gonna put it in the fridge and wait till it firms up so we are going to be back in a second but just to go over things again in Canada it is the 450 of the frosting of your choice and 450 of the peanut butter I used a 500 gram jar and just left a little bit in it and in the states it's 16 ounces of the frosting and one pound or 16 ounces of the peanut butter so this is gonna go in the fridge and we'll see you in a little while okay it's been a couple of hours so we're taking it out it seems fully formed but it doesn't seem like it's at an incredibly hard fudge now generally what I do when I'm cutting fudge just because I'm weird it's I I like pulling off the edges that aren't perfect like especially if I'm going to be putting it in a tin for somebody seems really soft I think next time we'll maybe try and keep it in the fridge for longer but I'm just gonna cut it and then put it back in the fridge I'm going to be storing this in the fridge because I'm not sure if you kept this at room temperature it might get too soft I'm not sure but we are going to try this and see what it's like Jesse just gonna try piece and I am it's really soft very very creamy and I have to say it kind of tastes like a peanut butter cup doesn't it Jesse Jesse's not talking much she's sick with a cold he's like a peanut butter cup in a real warm room when it gets just a little soft I like it and I'm surprised because it's I would have never thought to use frosting and peanut butter but this has a great taste the texture is a little softer than my fudge if you go to fairs and that you get sliced the fudge this is a little softer but if you're serving it to people it really doesn't matter and I find when you put it in tins in that and they overlap they even if it sticks a little bit together you can do that or you can put them in single world rows and it'll be fine it may firm up if you give it a little more time but honestly taste and texture wise it tastes extremely creamy this is something you can literally make in four minutes five minutes tops put it in your fridge for a couple of hours and it's ready so it's perfect if you've got to bring something in to work or you want to make something for dessert or bring somewhere it it's perfect because it's cheap and it's really really easy and I don't think people will suspect it was only two ingredients and especially it being frosting out of a can so this one gets a thumbs up comment below if you've ever tried this and/or you're going to give it a try we'd appreciate it also like and subscribe that would be really nice and next time", "qfiCPhCCtsc": "My Kitchen and another episode of the holidays are coming now just when you thought I was done making hot beverage mixes here I go again now I had a one of my YouTube friends bear-bear prepper asked me if I had a recipe for cocoa mix that incorporated chocolate and peanut butter because that was her favorite combination well you know how can I let that go by cuz that sounded so fabulous so she asked me if I had one using the peanut butter powder from the food storage well I didn't have any peanut butter powder so I went on honey bill really fast and I ordered two cans of peanut butter powder to try out and they weren't very expensive at all in fact I think they were like less than ten dollars a can and I decided to go ahead and try this so I got my peanut butter powder and I got a few other things out of the pantry and let's make some peanut butter cup cocoa I think it's gonna be great so this is what I came up with very very similar in composition to some of the others we're gonna use a bag of peanut butter chips and this is this is a 10 ounce bag and it's already open because brick had to taste them make sure they were all right yeah I'm gonna use a cup of peanut butter powder two boxes of instant chocolate pudding for serving size a cup of non-dairy creamer a cup of we're using the milk alternative or you can use just nonfat dry milk whatever you have on hand and I'm gonna use a cup of powdered sugar and a cup of cocoa and we're going to mix this all up in the food processor move all this out of the way bring over our friend the first thing we're going to do just like we did with the coffee coffee latte we're gonna turn on our machine we're gonna stream in the peanut butter chips so you know from experience that this gets noisy yourself again that's right about where you want it just like that's really fine okay so this is peanut butter powder that's what that looks like ironically enough look it kinda looks like that but you know being Who I am when I got it and I opened up the camera I stuff like they wet my finger and stuck it in there I tasted it guess what tastes like peanut butter it tastes like peanut butter you know just like natural peanut butter cuz that's all it is is dehydrated powdered peanut butter it's very cool hey have a creamer and I don't have very much creamer left in there so I'm just going to dump it in and I'm trying to mix in between editions because I found that sometimes if you layer things in there it doesn't get mixed up as well as it should and then you can't pulse it of course it's gonna get better and then if you smack it it's even better I know I say don't do this at home but we all do it don't we okay here's some powdered milk and pulsing it's causing them light to break so Jing all righty so there we've got some yummy looking peanut butter powder going on in there and chips and milk and creamer so we've got a lovely hot peanut butter drink right now how about some powdered sugar down there stir that up for a minute good things take time okay now I have to get a spoon sorry honey just spoon some cocoa I'm going to use a cup of cocoa and this is just basically to deepen that chocolate flavor I guess if you wanted to you could use chocolate chips instead of peanut butter chips along with the peanut butter powder and that would work too but I really wanted to pronounce peanut butter flavor and we're using the chocolate pudding so I thought that was probably so this is kind of an experiment and it is mixing you can see it coming up from the bottom certain them incorporate like that and if you just leave it on you can watch it eventually it will be all chocolatey meantime I'll open up these chocolate puddings and I'll start streaming and again this is gonna make enough for at least four combs okay I think that we're just about done let's see what smells really good you could just push the button and walk away from it for a few minutes and it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt it at all I just like to get it really well incorporated you can see how rich that looks and it really is mixing well so it just takes time that's all oh you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna heat up some water because I think that we need to try it it looks well mixed all the way all right well I'm gonna go heat up this water then when we come back I'm gonna fix you a nice steamy mug of peanut butter cup cocoa I'll be right back and let's make a cup of this there's a quarter cup measure steep a third of a cup of the mix and it'll fill it up with some water good huh so our experiment was successful huh awesome I wanted to go over some of the ingredients first before we leave I realized that a lot of you may not have peanut butter powder I think a lot of my prepper friends will have peanut butter powder um I didn't have peanut butter powder until last week when it came in the mail but if you don't have peanut butter powder just leave it out it's not gonna compromise the recipe any if you want a peanut buttery flavor add another half a bag of peanut butter chips in when you make it and I added a half cup and a half of the creamer because that's about how much was left in my jar so you know this is all up to you make it your own you know if you like uh let's say you could probably make this would could easily be made into a fluffernutter kind of or mellow cup but you all know what those are Mallo cups they're like a peanut butter cup with marshmallow in them you could make that into that by tossing some mini marshmallows in there putting them on the top when you package it up you can put chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and mini marshmallows in the bag with it and it would look super it would make a really nice presentation when you put it in your mug put your tag on it give it to your neighbor your friend your coworker easy as that but I did want to mention that about the peanut butter powder I realize a lot of you may not have it so don't you know don't fret no worries make your own peanut butter powder by using the chips and the processor like that or you could even use your blender but make sure you turn it on first so or they can get crushing with a rolling pin crushing it with a rolling pin isn't really gonna work that good I don't think you really want to get it superfine if you have a small kitchen chopper just do it in batches just don't put them all in there at once because you might end up with something very unpleasant and it might not work as well but in any case I want to go over that I want to share this with you bare prepper I hope that helps I hope you enjoy it if you try it I really think that you're gonna like it because I think it's really tasty so there you have it peanut butter cup cocoa another beverage mix from me to you and join us tomorrow when we will be doing", "IMxd1DCgOoI": "hi everybody its Jeanette today we're talking all right so who doesn't know about Reese's I'm not even a chocolate lover and come Halloween I got to throw these things away because I will eat one a day so I'm gonna give you a better alternative and a healthy alternative so milk chocolate it has sugar so that's not what I'm worried about I'm worried about the other ingredients serving size six pieces two three sugar five and a half teaspoons two four teaspoons okay we know once again the daily intake for sugar is six teaspoons a day this is they're both very close and surpassing that Reese's when you look at the nutritional label the first thing that you notice is the oil they're using partially hydrogenated oils it has trans fat so what do we know about trans fat it affects your cholesterol levels so your good cholesterol it lowers it and your bad cholesterol it increases when you look at the label it says zero grams of trans fat well there's a loophole if you have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat in the ingredient list you don't have to put it in there but as soon as you start meeting the ingredients you know that it contains trans fat so they're kind of tricky on that there as we keep going you're gonna see the preservative TBHQ once again there's a lot of studies on it it is derived from petroleum that sounds so yummy right and the problem with that is is that they have limits on how much they can use so if you are having a lot of processed foods imagine all that TBHQ that you are consuming we know that it causes vomiting we know that it causes nauseousness once again in larger quantities but the average family is eating processed foods at every single meal and TBHQ is one of those preservatives that is used so often so I'm always watching for TBHQ and B H t other than that I mean this product could be so much worse they're not using our special colors or anything like that but there is a better alternative and it is Justin's they have a great brand of peanut butter almond butter if you are a Nutella lover they have hazelnut that is a better alternative to the top so when you look at it it has all the other right labels it is organic it's gluten free but as soon as you read the label you know how to pronounce every ingredient you know that they're using organic milk chocolate they're using organic sugar organic milk organic vanilla flavor and it goes on everything you can read it and you understand where it's coming from whereas Reese's Pieces we started looking at some of these ingredients and you're like what does p ger you know these are things that we don't recognize so if you can read it you understand it chances are it's not a bad product so I hope that you enjoyed my product review of peanut butter cups and just since you can find it in most grocery stores so please feel free to share with your friends and family", "F1sILoa23ec": "this is the ultimate treat a s'mores dip made in a cast-iron skillet loaded with melted chocolate peanut butter cups and toasted marshmallow this is a s'mores dip you can enjoy no campfire needed this recipe is not only simple to make but it's less messy than traditional s'mores it actually comes from five Hart home and she says it's her go-to party dip so you're going to start by preheating your oven to 450 degrees with your cast iron skillet in there because you want your skillet to get super hot because we're actually going to coat the entire pan with a little bit of oil you can also use butter the oil is what's going to prevent all that chocolate and marshmallow from sticking to the edges so we're going to start with our first layer of chocolate chips one and a half cups just pour them all in oh my gosh the chocolate is already melting next we're going to add our peanut butter cups and you heard me right when I go camping and make s'mores I always put a big Reese's Peanut Butter Cup right in between my graham cracker and my marshmallow and as you're placing your peanut butter cups you want to be super careful because this pan is really hot we're gonna put ten peanut butter cups making one layer now we're going to top this with marshmallows and I've already cut them in half now the reason why we do this is because if we put an entire marshmallow on top the top would burn but then everything else wouldn't melt so this helps it give that perfect ratio I love s'mores so much because it reminds me of going camping with my friends hanging out around the campfire laughing having fun and it's also one of those things you don't make all the time so it's such a special treat when I do it a couple times a year but now that I have the stick recipe I can make it anytime I want oh my goodness this smells so good I can hardly wait so now we're gonna pop it back into the oven for five to seven minutes at 450 degrees and we just want our chocolate to be nice and melted for those marshmallows to get really toasted and golden brown to make sure you keep an eye on it so after you take the dip out you want to make sure you let it rest for about five minutes and let your guests know that this skillet is hot oh my gosh it's not wait to try it this dip is so yummy and seriously ever since I started adding my Reese's peanut butter cups to my s'mores I can't imagine it without them now as far as presentation you got to serve your dip with some graham crackers you can even add the cinnamon ones and for fun little Teddy Grahams thanks so much for watching if you guys love s'mores as much as I do let me know I'm always looking for fun combinations who might actually feature your recipe on the next episode I'm brandy I'll see you next time bye", "bkkngwtfU8E": "remember that commercial in the 70s you got the peanut butter in my chocolate and chocolate in my peanut butter well Willy Wonka over here is taking that very seriously with these homemade peanut butter cups we're gonna start with the base layer of your peanut butter cup so in the bowl here we have a 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate and a quarter cup of cream that we've heated up and truly it's going to whisk with a little bit of muscle okay so we're gonna speed up the process a bit we have our chocolate melted and you're gonna scoop just a spoonful for the base of the crust just a small spoon try not to make it messy okay you're doing a good job you want me to finish up oh yes just a little bit uptight today sure why so when all your muffin cups are filled this is gonna go in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to harden and then we're gonna put the next layer on let's see how much fun she has when I don't say anything the base of our peanut butter cups are have firmed up in the refrigerator and now we're ready

special so you don't lose it kind of small let it be known this is the first time ever i've had to stop in the middle of vacuuming the house to empty the canister that's all you in there girl hair dirt sticks you name it my goodness i only did the downstairs which is probably not even as bad as the upstairs i did do the stairs too oh my goodness this girlfriend she sheds and i brush her and brush her and brush her every morning okay you guys michael picked up some things from the grocery store today for us to try taste test i've seen these new we just saw this commercial yeah they've been showing it with pretzels inside not my thing we'll try it and then the reese's this must be easter thing because there's eggs on it a mallow top so i don't know if it's like it says marshmallow flavored cream marshmallow flavored cream it's not sticky like a sticky marshmallow yeah so i want to do that one first the good one okay so we've been watching what bowl games and it's sponsored by reese's and so like all the commercials are a reese's peanut butter cup it was a bowl game or something no uh it was football i know that right or was it basketball and i can't remember it i think it was football because i think they had it printed on the field anyway so i was like oh i wonder he says all right so first show it it's got the white top i hope it's not white chocolate i hope it's actually like marshmallow marshmallow flavored cream i think it might be white chocolate yeah i kind of wondered if they're trying to pull one over on us how was it though still pretty darn good huh okay and then that's good these are the big cups what are you doing all those crumbs are going to be good put do it over our plate so we can knit so we can pop off and put it okay she shoves the whole thing in i mean that was her smile don't shove this whole thing in your mouth i won't that you were supposed to turn it's taste test not shove the whole thing in your mouth and then trying to get her done because her friends are outside playing she wants to go play okay let's get her over done well now you gotta eat what's in here bigger bite because you're gonna have to get into the peanut butter i always told her a little bite and she takes the tiniest did you get pretzel any crunchies yeah so how is it going which one do you like better that one the mallow just because you ate more of it because she shut the whole thing in her mouth all right you can get suited up and go play now and if you hear kids yelling in the background they're just playing but now somebody's finished her food and wants to uh know what we got going on yeah that's peanut butter flavor too probably smell that oh yeah hey i want some of that you are being naughty down it's not white chocolate no oh good i like white chocolate but i want something different they've done the white chocolate you know like that mix it is marshmallow flavor wondering why it's so melty it's like i like it well you're really a fan of reese's anyways it adds a different that's weird i don't know yeah like i don't think that should be in there maybe i don't like it that's a tough one kind of leaves an aftertaste okay so at the very first taste of it it just adds like a sweetness to it like a really strong like vanilla e sweetness well here try the but then the more i think about it the more i'm like pretzel no i'm not huge on the whole like pretzel nope i like pretzels but separate it's not bad it wouldn't be something i'd run to get again the reese's peanut butter cups that are the big cups like this but they're just the plain greasy peanut butter cups they're good but like i just kind of feel like why why ruin it with pretzels why stick pretzels in there it's just not my thing all right so it's not your thing it's definitely not gonna be mine i'm not even a big reese's pant fan in the beginning like i said give me the big greasy peanut butter cup like that oh yeah heck yeah even small reese's peanut butter cups but like add weird things to it like that and i'm just not i don't know i really don't taste the pretzel i like the crunch but don't they make like a crunchy peanut reeses they also have or have they they have one with reese's pieces inside did they not have that no she's being naughty but we've already done that one why does she do that to you she doesn't really do it to me once in a great while it's because she wants your attention so badly oh she doesn't get food from me i mean we're gonna eat them all and we're gonna enjoy it all right i get a little bit of salty and then the crunch and then a little bit of just like the plain from the inside of the pretzel i guess maybe i actually kind of like it i like the crunch yeah i'm not tasting pretzel it's not getting in the way you can't have it honey it's got chocolate she just ate whole bowl of food but she's still like i want more care to explain yourself look at this mess do you see all of it all the sticks i see it i guess you can kind of see it on camera didn't see that over there oh my gosh and this doesn't include the sticks that i picked up off the stairs and downstairs carpet i just who let her have sticks yeah she's so cute she chews on him and it makes her happy and they feel bad taking them away so i just vacuumed the whole house today including the couch yeah you can wait he wants to go out it's body time yep and uh yeah she found a good stick today and of course the day i vacuum and it's just i was thinking wow it looks really nice in here everything's all nice and clean and i was gonna mop the floors probably tomorrow like that's something over not when you have kids got a big furry one look at her nose how do you say no to that she's so cute and check them out and she's got like the pouty look going with her big brown eyes is it a good stick was it worth it [Music] you", "vLkYF23TVHg": "I hi I'm Verna's and welcome to local kid recipes and having fun today I have the recipe for a copycat Reese's Peanut Butter Cup they are absolutely so simple to make as well as they turn out divine here's what I have I want to show you let me break one open and show you what it is like inside the perfect peanut butter cup so we're standing in my kitchen so let's get cookin so let's begin with the recipe we begin with half a cup of peanut powder peanut powder is nothing but peanuts that have been roasted in a pan and then put into the blender for a few pulses next we have 1/3 of a cup of peanut butter this is the next level when you are making peanut powder if you carry on on the blender it'll become peanut butter so 1/3 of a cup of peanut butter next we have 1/3 of a cup of a sweetener of your choice I've put a blend of erythritol and stevia mix next we have 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract extract I'm just eyeballing it but one teaspoon should be good enough ok now the idea is get your hands in again and make these into little balls this is very important for this recipe because if you didn't use peanut powder and the combination of peanut powder and peanut butter allows you to make it into balls like this which stay well next I'm taking a bar of Lily's chocolate bar which has stevia in it so I will not need to sweeten that but if you are using a dark chocolate bar then you will need to used maybe 1/4 of a cup of a sweetener along with it in that's the entire bar in the bowl and I'm going to microwave it in bursts of 15 seconds for about 45 seconds okay now that it's melted I'm putting in 1 to 2 teaspoons of cream so that it just becomes nice and liquid so that it's easy when you put it into your molds so you can also melt the chocolate with putting the cream along with it whichever went your way works for you okay now that it's become nice and glossy we are ready to put all this together it's such as such a simple recipe these are the two things we need and now how we put it together is important okay I've taken a muffin tray and in that I've put in muffin cups but I'm using silicone ones but you can use the paper ones anything even your muffin tray can be a 10:1 - silicone it really doesn't matter but do put in some muffin wrappers into it because otherwise it'll be very tough to take it out of your tin or your silicon tray so now I've put in a bit of chocolate at the bottom and what I'm doing is I'm pulling it a little up we just need a lit to have this little bit of height so that it when you put your next layer of chocolate later it'll join up with this now I'm taking a little ball that I made of the peanut butter peanut powder mix and I'm going to make it into a disk shape so basically I make it round and then I flatten it out in my hands just like that and I'm going to place it inside the on top of the chocolate right in this Center and now what I'm going to do is cover it with chocolate again and just see that your chocolate goes to every nook and cranny and corner so that you don't have any of the peanut butter popping out you won't need more than one and a half to two teaspoons to put on top okay now that that is ready that's what it should look like and that's how I'll be doing all the rest of them so now that all of them I'm showing you one more method when you put the chocolate at the bottom just roll your mold around that's another way to make it come up a little bit on the sides can you see that that's what we want okay now that all of them are ready they are ready to go into the fridge overnight or in the freezer for a few hours what I have done at the end was I put a little bit of Hershey's dark cocoa powder on top I just like the taste but you can completely omit this this is certainly not necessary for the recipe so in they'll go into the freezer great overnight and you might have to keep them in the fridge because they might melt otherwise if you keep them out in the open so that's what they look like when they've come out the perfect copycat Reese's peanut butter thanks for watching buy them [Music]", "k9geJRAhCHA": "hey Anna okay whenever we do intros yeah baby I'm really bad mood you yeah works for me I'm ready it goes like this Oh cheers Rosanna yes please leave hey

rewind and today's video is going to be one of my favorite things ever back in the day I was obsessed with Reese's peanut butter cups and when it was Easter time I'd always get the Reese's Peanut Butter eggs so I thought hey time to make a keto version and I'll share it so I'm gonna make a keto version of I have my silicone mold is actually Easter bunnies but it's the same recipe use what you have and make these keto Reese's bunnies and so anyways I'll show you how to make it and enjoy these they take you probably have these ingredients in your pantry and you can they take maybe a half an hour to make so go ahead and make some don't be tempted by that Easter candy don't do it make these instead so here's how to make them okay so you're gonna take a medium-sized bowl and put your butter in your coconut oil in it and melt it and then you'll need a powdered sweetener I my go-to is either swerve or la canto I keep them in stock all the time in this case I'm using swerve which is powdered erythritol and using a hand mixer just beat it all together know that you can add up to a cup of sweetener but I like it on this unlike a little bit less sweet so I just went with the half cup but just do a just your sweetener to taste and this is bulk peanut butter that you get fresh ground that has nothing but ground peanuts in it so but use a natural peanut butter that has no sweetener and add that in there mix it all around so it's nice and fluffy and mixed well and once that's all that's all incorporated you can actually want to say the the recipe to this is down below but then you're gonna take your mold and just push it in there so it's nice and tight so you get it all in there I thought that these were going to be a lot more detailed but either way it doesn't matter just use any silicone mold but being that I didn't buy enough trays I have to put my overflow in this mini cupcake pan so there's there's the finished product that I'm gonna pop in the freezer for about a half an hour so they're good and frozen and it just makes it easier to work with and they come out of the mold so these are now after it's been in there for probably like a half an hour so they're nice and frozen and they come out in one piece isn't that cute so pop those all out and in the meantime you're gonna melt Lilly's chocolate chips and coconut oil in a bowl and they'll that's nice and melty it's easy to dip and once that's nice and smooth just take a fork or a spoon and put your peanut butter mixture in there and then you know repeat make sure all the sides are coated and you're gonna put on parchment paper so that it will harden up and it'll come off nice and easy once it's done and just repeat that for all of them and for me I just throw them in there do whatever you want that touched it it's my food calm down keep the food police but anyways these are such a good alternative to the peanut butter cup that's loaded with sugar just make these it took it really from the time it actually took it maybe half an hour from start to finish including the time it took to freeze them so that's what they look like fresh out of the freezer they are ready to enjoy and they're about a 1 they're about a carb apiece so just know that maaan don't eat them all in one sitting but you know I like to store them in the fridge and here's a look at what they look like on the inside so enjoy well I hope you have a great weekend this is my last video into my week 61 update so I hope you enjoyed this recipe and I'll see you then bye bye I'm Jax and you're watching kita rewind you", "DpswYLuLa_Q": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to French cheese bakery today we are going to be making my world-famous chocolate peanut butter pink and it is so so scrumptious so you guys are in for a treat today and you are welcome in advance for giving you this recipe so the first thing we should talk about is their peanut butter icing I actually made this and I didn't film it because I'm so stupid sorry so I'm just going to explain how I made it for you wrote like so you're going to start off with 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and going to make sure that it's a room temperature nice and creamy you're gonna whip it up in your mixer for about 30 seconds until it becomes lame fluffy then you're going to add in about a pinch of salt a teaspoon just to make it a little bit salty not too sweet and then about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just lift up together and then you're going to add in a cup of peanut butter and you're going to mix up to give it for a little bit and then you're going to add in two cups of powdered sugar whip that up for a little bit add in 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and whip that up for a good minute and then you're going to add in 2 more cups of powdered sugar and if it's too thick you can add in a little bit more of heavy whipping cream but typically 1/4 cup does the job so that's how you were going it to make your peanut butter icing and just whip it up I would say whip it for like 5 minutes so it becomes nice light and fluffy and then I made my chocolate cake layers so whatever chocolate cake recipe you prefer you can use that I just did my typical chocolate cake recipe and after you make your cake layers and your icing we're then going to move on to icing the cake so we're just gonna do that as we normally would we're just going to put some icing between each layer spread it out nice and evenly and keep stacking it put on a nice crumb coat pop it in the freezer for about ten minutes and then we're going to pop on our last coat of icing so I will show you all those steps I will show you you need putting icing in between each layer for your number crumb coat and putting on the final coat and I will just do a little time up so you guys so you can see me putting it together so yeah let's go do that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so now that we have our nice peanut butter coat on our cake we were then going to move on to personally my favorites the ganache it's so good so the way you're going to make ganache it is so it's equal parts I just did a half cup so you're gonna do a half a cup of heavy whipping cream and a half cup of chocolate so you're going to put the half a cup of heavy whipping cream in the microwave make it come to a full boil and then you're going to add your chocolate and that let it sit for a little bit and then start to stir it and it will become a thick syrup kind of and you will let this sit out for about an hour and it will become the perfect consistency for Dripping and if it is too thick and you can pop it in the microwave for like three seconds that's all you need shake it up and if it's too runny you can pop it in the freezer and it will become Mason sticks for you so we are going to just drip this around our cake just do really really really light pressure everywhere just the whole way around the cake and we're also going to put this all over the top and smooth it out with an offset spatula I think that it gives the cake the best flavor and I just love the consistency of it and it's also going to help keep our better come back to the top I'm getting ahead of myself so that's why I'm like trying to okay so we're going to drift this around the cake now [Music] all right now that we have our drips going the whole way around the cake we are then going to add on some little decorations on the top so you're gonna want to use the rest of your peanut butter icing and use a star tip at the end of your piping bag and we're just going to pipe some swirls of the whole way around at the top so you're just going to do a burst of pressure and keep swirling it around and we're just going to do that the whole way around the top of the cake [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right and now we are going to add in our Reese's peanut butter cups so I normally use the full-size ones but I had a bag of minis and this cake is pretty small so this is gonna work out so what I like to do is grab a few and you want to make sure that your hands are clean obviously and just crush them up and put them all on the inside of where you swirled that peanut butter icing and we lock the piece here and we're just gonna put a nice coat from the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup on top of that ganache and it's just so young stealing my Reese's peanut butter cups we have an obsession with Reese's peanut butter cups in this house but peanut butters is the best so now we are going to take some whole peanut butter cups and we're just going to place them on top of the swirls that we did so if you have full-size Reese's peanut butter cups I would recommend just cutting them so the peanut butter shows I'm just really into like cutting um and having them show like that but these little ones are so tiny that I'm not going to cut them [Music] alright guys and then for the finishing touch we are going to take the rest of our ganache and just drizzle it over the top I like to just go up up and beyond for this cake so we're just gonna drizzle it all over the top and just look so this is how you create front cheese bakery world-famous chocolate peanut butter cake it is so scrumptious at the Lamborghini Matheny outside Michael is playing with his cars right now playing with his toys so yes this is how you make the yummy yummy yummy peanut butter cake and it is yummy so thank you guys so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it make sure to LIKE and subscribe enjoy this cake and I will see you on the next one have a good rest day everyone bye [Music]", "rZPOC59pCzY": "yes and welcome back to Rene GTV today we're going to do these fabulous peanut butter brownies and very simple and easy to do we're going to start out with preferably a mini muffin pan if you have one if you don't I don't I'm just using a regular cupcake pan standard size okay you're going to make sure to grease all of those really well and then we're going to take some brownie mix I have mine already prepared and you can use a box mix for this I will try to upload a recipe here before long for this as well but just go ahead and look up a recipe or search my channel or also just use a box whatever is most convenient and then we are going to I'm going to move that out of my way and you guys can see me and we are just going to scoop and we're gonna fill these about halfway full it's gonna really depend on how much brownie batter it's actually kind of more of a dough we're gonna see how much we have left when I'm done I've done two batches here so I'm gonna go ahead and just fill up these wells and I'll be right back hey guys so I filled these about 3/4 of the way I have 12 of these here I am going to I've got probably enough for about another 4 or 5 more we're gonna bake these at 350 and we're gonna pull them out right before or right after the top of these set okay so about 15 minutes at 350 we'll be right back okay so you pull them out at about 15 minutes just till the tops are set and they should fall in in the center if they don't you can just take a spoon and just push down in the center of each one okay and we'll be back we're going to add some filling while it's still hot right and then while it's still when it comes right out of the oven you're just going to take about a tablespoon of peanut butter and you're gonna place it right into the center and then once we have all of the centers filled in with the peanut butter we are just going to take some semi-sweet chocolate chips and place them on each one about half of the peanut butter because we are going to add some milk chocolate as well but I guess really you could add whatever you like and then I like the color contrast okay and that peanut butter is melting really nicely so I'm going to finish with these in my suite and you'll come back and I will add the milk chocolate we'll be right back hey guys I've got all those added so we're gonna let those sit in the pan for about 10 to 15 minutes just while it is still hot so it does cook thoroughly through and in just a few minutes I'll pull those out and we'll serve them up sorry guys there they are absolutely delicious our peanut butter cup brownies give these a try let me know what you think don't forget thumbs up and share me on Facebook

going to make peanut butter balls these are very similar to a peanut butter cup in that they have that really nice smooth and shiny dark chocolate on the outside and inside it's a really nice creamy smooth peanut butter filling and they're really easy to make they take a little time because we have to dip each ball in chocolate but it's not hard at all and these are really nice at Christmas time make a really good gift so to begin we have to melt or melt peanut butter with butter now you can do this in the microwave which I'm going to do or you could just put it in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water so make sure your bowl can go in the microwave and put you need two cups which is 480 milliliters of creamy peanut butter I don't don't use the chunky use the creamy smooth and whatever your favorite brand use that and then to that you need a quarter of a cup it's about 55 grams or four tablespoons of butter and have that like really soft and then I like to cut it into pieces because that will melt a lot faster and then to that depending on now if your peanut butter is really salty or if you're using salted butter I wouldn't bother with a quarter teaspoon of salt I'm just going to my peanut butter is not too salty and I'm using unsalted butter and so just stir that together so now what we're going to do is put this in the microwave for about a minute on high it depends on your speed of your microwave take anywhere from a minute to two minutes and what you wanted is just get it nice and soft you don't want it liquid just soft and check it periodically and stir it but it takes somewhere around a minute okay that's all nice and smooth you can see it's just it's soft you want that butter to melt and then the peanut butter is nice and soft so now just uh stir in 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and the last ingredient is confectioner sugar you may know that is powder to rice and sugar you're going to need anywhere from 2 to say 2 and 1/2 cups which is about 230 grams to 300 grams it depends on your peanut butter the texture of it how much but what we're looking for I'm going to start with 2 cups adding stirring into that one nice smooth dough that we can roll into balls so if it's too soft and with 2 cups like you can't form it into a nice ball then just add a little more as you can see this is a real easy no baked confection to make this in really large amounts make sure all that sugar is mixed in you can see it starts to get a little harder to stir I'm going to switch over to my wooden spoon you see it's the cleanup it's still a little too soft to roll into a ball so I'm going to add adding more get your hands in there too if you want which I think I'm going to do and like play-doh really want to mix that up get it really nice and smooth it's still little okay we're almost there you see it's really nice and thick so I'm just gonna take a bit so that's good I can roll it into oh now you can make these as big or as small as you want I usually make them about an inch which is about two and a half centimeters and then just have a you can either put a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet or wax paper in aluminum foil and just place them on your baking sheet okay so as you can see I have about sixty at about one inch ball so you know depending on what the size is you get more or less so what we're going to do now is put these in the refrigerator you want to have them in there until they're firm I mean at least an hour but what I really like to do is make them one day and then let them sit even overnight and then dip them in the chocolate the next day so into the fridge until firm so now for our chocolate coating you will need nine ounces that's 260 grams of dark chocolate now you can use either a semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate just make sure it's a really top quality one that you enjoy eating just by itself and you could even if you like you could use half semi-sweet chocolate and half even milk chocolate if you'd like to do that and to this I'm going to add about 1 tbsp of shortening you could also use a flavorless oil and what this does is it keeps the chocolate nice and shiny even after we've melted it so just put that together and then it's in the heat proof Bowl and I'm going to put this over a saucepan of simmering water and just melt it until it's smooth okay chocolate it's now melted so remove from heat give it a quick stir and then what I like to do is to put it in the chocolate in a smaller bowl because it makes dipping your peanut butter balls so much easier now have a little more chocolate on hand because it's hard to know whether you'll need more or less depending on how thick you coat your peanut butter balls so I just removed some of them from the refrigerator at a time and a really easy thing what I like to do and it faster just pop these in the freezer and if you get really hard makes dipping so much easier so there's a lot of different ways you could dip these I have if you have the candy making tools you could just use a spoon a fork or you could even just use a toothpick and just um stick your toothpick in dip it in your chocolate let the excess run off and then put it back let's take a look and then what I like to do is take a little bit of crushed peanuts just put it over the top cover up the little hole there now if if you want to make what is called a Buckeye which is essentially a peanut butter ball but you want to leave you don't dip the whole thing you leave the top bare so that you can actually see the peanut butter filling so you just keep if you have one of these handy little tools or nice too and just put it in lift it up let the excess so this is a time-consuming part you just got a little bit of a production-line and like I said just popping these in the freezer for even like a half hour before you dip that way they're nice and firm and then once you've done like a pan just put them back into the refrigerator until they're thoroughly chilled and then you could store them in the refrigerator in a container for at least two weeks or I like to even freeze them so until next time I'm Stephanie drawers gave joy begging calm", "GuENAWds5B0": "peanutbutter mmm chocolate you got peanut butter on my chocolate well you got chocolate in my peanut butter bravissimo two great tastes that taste great

recess every what we're going to need take about six cup milk chocolate chips measuring cups well call the peanut butter about three times our mold which in this case is the top of it disclosable type in black favored three cups of powdered sugar and our mixing bowl i want to gigantic Reese's I want this to come out by at least three pounds so there's our three cups of chocolate chips number two takes the microwave you're gonna new get my 30-second increments try to do good for longer than that to melt it all at once you will probably burn it and ruin it I've done it a million times it's super irritating and then you just have to go to school alright remelted chocolate you can see it's [Music] wind up with some nonsense it looks like that put it in the fridge try about two hours to be safe my daughter would tell you to put it in the blast chiller and now we're going to make people are feeling more ounces three cups of powdered sugar we're going to be doing about three quarters of a stick of butter mix the rest of this by hand anybody asked me if I go to the gym the Train I don't have a giant bowl of sugar take our easy foil pan this does look pretty gigantic and delicious welcome back to carnivores down the kitchen it's been about four hours this is what we had I actually want to try to detach this from the mold it'll be a lot harder to do if you wait so now we're gonna get in there get that parchment paper and we're going to put her back in the shell she's gonna fit like you do though now we're gonna take peanut butter filling which is pretty substantial didn't me kind of sketch that down a little bit so this is what we have soul my goodness this is heavy and now we get to make our top back cooking this is a leftover 1 cup from before five eggs this is two more cups about two tablespoons of butter we're gonna do this again we will weigh this when we pop it out you probably train with this thing I'm excited let's take this out of the fridge and see if we didn't mess the whole thing up this is what we have a gigantic buttercup 0.0 pounces sometimes five seventy nine point two ounces we have the identical plastic container here this man plastic container that it came in weighs a whopping point six ounces so about seventy eight point six ounces just under five pounds Wow are you not excited I am a seven and roughly 2,200 plus grams meaning it is over a hundred and ten times the size of a regular Reese's Peanut Butter Cup meaning I might actually get my Reese's Peanut Butter Cup date today and I am extremely excited to pop it that way out here [Music] you know it's not gonna stick the bottom eat your heart out Jesus so now we actually to enjoy this monstrosity sorry let's give us a taste test so get to the macros this is

people coming over because it's about the size of 110 little more than 110 regular basis the Americans so depending how much you like Reese's you can make them you getting through the bottom layer like white chocolate top layer dark shop a lot of different ways you can do that all right guys macros on this 1162 grams carbs 264 grams of protein and around 743 so just ask me how I am regularly Greece's man's they can't even think about it but in normal size reasons in my hand up I don't know I figured just eat him depends on which one like kick cats on particular anti eat them and I kind of fight around the edges of trust a firm in a wicker part yeah it is where like twigs even sometimes I'll eat the caramel chocolate part off the top and safety cookie need that but you know how do you guys these Reese's do you need to round the edges and say the middle do you somehow eat the middle and the edges if you do that I'm impressed and I kind of want to see how it works yeah I know we've got weird preferences like me with the Twix kick ads everybody's being maybe it's not that heavy we need to pretending I'm slightly this came out that Volvo the first time I've ever done enjoying Reese's I love to bake and stuff but I've never done obviously peanut butter cup so I'm kind of really happy this came out it makes me kind of want try other gigantic creations he has many ideas let

tell me in the comments if she looks like she's 18 because I mean she looks like she's much younger than now but anyway she's turning the big one eight and I asked her what kind of cake she wanted and what did you say I said I wanted a cheesecake yeah so it has been I would say several years since I've made a cheesecake so I'm a little bit nervous about this to be completely honest and she wants a peanut butter cheesecake correct because she loves peanut butter and that is something I have never made so for this one I went on Pinterest to see what I could find I found a recipe that I'm gonna follow for the most part and I will have that link down below and so we're gonna just jump in here and and kind of see how this goes like I said it's been years since I've minute she's cake and cheesecakes kind of always intimidate me a little bit mainly because of the water bath factor in it actually cheesecakes in and of themselves are pretty easy as far as ingredients they're very simple but the water bath thing always kind of scares me a little bit so I will jump in here and show you I believe in you with my adult powers yes I'm glad you believe in me because I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out I did think it was cool she wanted to take though because that was always what I wanted when I was a little bit older my mom always made me this strawberry cake that was she turned into a bunny because my birthday's in spring and then she started doing that for me up until like 11 or 12 yeah cuz your birthday's in spring I'm a link that cake recipe oh it is so delicious the strawberry cake I did it you did the Valentine's yes I did it into a heart shape but anyway I will link that about but I was excited she wanted a cheesecake cuz that's what I always wanted when I was a little bit older too okay so what you're gonna need make this it's first off you're gonna need some peanut butter being that this is a peanut butter cheesecake you're also gonna need four bricks of room-temperature cream cheese these are eight ounce bricks so you need four of those and then you also want your eggs what you'll need for at room tip and sure I don't know if the recipe I'm following says that but usually you want to have your eggs at room temperature for a cheesecake too then you are gonna have one and a third cup granulated sugar and then some whipping cream and then the recipe I am following calls for chocolate chips inside of it I thought that was too boring so I'm gonna put the Reese's not only on top but in the Cheesecake batter ii thought that sounded better than just plain old chocolate chips okay so that is all you're gonna need for the Cheesecake itself pretty simple and then for the crust you're gonna need two cups of crushed Oreos I'm not sure exactly how many Oreos two cups is gonna be but we're gonna try to figure that out spearmint yes so calls for two cups of crushed Oreos and then four tablespoons of melted butter and that's all you need for the crust and then on top there's going to be a ganache along with the Reese's Cups and so for the ganache ganache is super simple it is just chocolate chips and more heavy whipping cream so that is all you're gonna need to make this you're also gonna need a springform pan yeah that's it so let's get started so first things first and that is to get your springform pan ready to go and so what you're going to do with that is you want to put a piece of parchment in the bottom of it and then you need to prep it for the water bath and the water bath is what makes me the most nervous like I said about making a cheesecake because it can go wrong basically so you don't have to do a water bath I should say if you don't if you really don't want to so the thing about a water bath is the reason you do it basically is this is a custard really and like custards or it's basically custard I should say and so that being the case it's it's definitely a delicate thing to bake and it just does a whole lot better with that moisture in there and the water bath basically cooks it more evenly it keeps it at a lower temperature despite what the temperature is in the oven and that just creates a better product basically in the end if you don't do what about what you're gonna end up with possibly is kind of a rubbery texture not that nice creamy texture that we think of with cheesecake it can get dried out it can sink it can crack stuff like that so it definitely produces a much better product doing it with the water bath but then you do run into the risk of having that leak which is what I'm always afraid of so I'm gonna show you how I do it basically you're going to need some foil and you want kind of this big foil because you want it to be able to go all around the pan here so I'm gonna start out with piece of foil set my hand in the middle of it I'm gonna kind of just want to pull up this foil tightly Vince the side and again I am not good at this it's not something I do a lot and because I'm paranoid about this I'm going to do it again because who wants to your cheesecake I know I don't and that's the risk that you run it's doing this water bath now I have seen other ways of doing it where you can put this pan inside of a larger pan and then put back hand in the water mouth and I really like the idea of that and I would have done that if I had a like a larger cake pan basically I think this is 9 and a half inch springform so if you had like a 1011 if this could fit in you can just put this in that cake pan and then like I said put the cake pan in your water bath you're not gonna run the risk of having this foil leak and to me this just looks this is a look good but anyway we're gonna go with the water bath so now that I've got this kind of prepped and again this does not look the best but this is just how I'm doing it I'm gonna set this aside okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make the crust and I'm gonna use that food processor for that because I just want to easier you can if you don't have a food processor just take these and put them in like a ziplock bag and take a rolling pin and break them up that way and I do that a lot of the times but today I just figured I would get out the processor and do it though so like I said the recipe calls for 2 cups of Oreos well Oreo crumbs again I don't know what that's gonna be so I'm gonna start out with a sleeve and see what that looks like so I'm not sure eyeballing that how much that is so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just throw in another half a sleeve 88 cookies round up nicely browned up now I'm gonna take my butter and I dump that in there and blend that up and that will actually tell me if the consistency is right for the crust and that looks pretty good see that so I'm gonna call that good so I'm not gonna take this out of here and I'm gonna take my pan here and I'm gonna just dump this in here how good does this prep smell just all by itself it's like it everywhere I think we really should just make some cookies and dump some butter in them and grind them up and just eat it like that I love ya I could see doing that I love Oreo crust oh my gosh it's probably traditionally cheesecake is a graham cracker crust but I definitely like to use Oreo if it's something chocolate or you know just if it if it pairs well with the Cheesecake flavor that you're doing so I'm just pressing this in here and you can go up the side a little bit I'm not going to I'm just going to press it into the UH the bottom all the way around i did an oreo cheesecake one time that is probably the best cheesecake I've ever made oh my gosh it's so good but it has been years like I said since I've done a cheesecake so I'm a lil nervous okay so here is what that looks like now we're going to just take this and set this aside while we do our filling and I've got my oven preheating at 350 so first thing is the cream cheese and like I said it is four eight ounce breaks or 32 ounces of cream cheese and again you want these room temperature because they're gonna just blend up a whole lot easier then if they're cold let's go ahead open and I should point out that she wanted to help with this yeah I actually kind of felt bad that she didn't leave me to make my page no she wanted to help me do her cake I was like what's your birthday cake you don't want to actually help me birthday cake just get into this cookie thing it's a fascinating process so now we're gonna take our sugar pour that in there we're gonna just cream the two of these together real well okay that is nice and creamed together and I didn't have to knock this down once because there's a lot of a lot of cream cheese in here okay so now that we got that we are going to add in 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream gets better and better it does she goes along sugar our cream cheese heavy whipping cream oh okay so 1/3 cup of the heavy whipping cream I'm going to put in here and then they wonderful famous what this is named for peanut butter a cup of peanut butter now I am gonna say I'm not the biggest peanut butter fan I might like it but she can't clean no and when I had my mom when I always asked my mom to make me cheese cakes and that was I don't know probably 12 and up that's always what I asked for was cheesecake I always ask her to just do like the traditional lab New York style so just plain plain old cheesecake oh and I think I always prefer the cherries on top cherry cheesecake oh my gosh that's what I always liked when I was a kid now that being said I'm sure this is gonna be amazing too okay and then I'm gonna add in a little vanilla it says two teaspoons so I'm gonna put roughly that in there maybe a little more let's go heavy on the vanilla and then we're gonna just mix this together oK we've got that all nice and mixed together and it does smell amazing okay so now I'm gonna start putting these eggs in but I'm gonna have my daughter start unwrapping these races so that we can chop those up and add those in there too so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add in one egg at a time and what you want to do is just add this egg in and slowly start mixing it and you want to mix that until you don't see the egg anymore and then move on to adding the next one so now I'm gonna take these Reese's and then I'm gonna just rough chop these you guys should she do satisfying videos videos are you talking ASMR not in my future so you can just chop these to whatever size you want I'm gonna kind of make a little bit smaller I think then what I'm gonna do for the top huge giant I don't know I mean maybe if you do leave them bigger but uh hi yeah I think the will be better a little bit smaller in the batter okay so that's what I've got chopped up and I'm gonna just put these in my batter and I'm gonna just fold those in okay so that's what that looks like and I think that looks good I think there's enough pieces in there so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this and we're gonna pour it in our pan here on top of our crust and my daughter is off-screen right now licking the paddle nobody needs to see that wait you know I always did that as a kid how many of you guys did that ate the raw batter so to speak I guess is what it is it's raw batter how many guys did that ate the raw batter back in the day now you're not supposed to do that because it has egg in it but that never stops hopefully she doesn't get sick for her birthday which is tomorrow actually okay so I'm gonna just take this now and I'm gonna spread it in here and kind of try to smooth that top the best I can [Music] that is what that looks like now I've gotta get my water bath ready for a water bath you would traditionally use like a roaster pan or something I actually don't have one of those I was kind of surprised the ones I have are not going to be deep enough for a water bath so what I'm going to be using is this old cast-iron skillet which looks very very rough I actually tried to season this in made it way worse than what it originally looked like this is my grandma's skillet she gave this to me right before she passed away and so it's very special to me and I need to figure out how to get this season so that I can use it but it's definitely in rough shape right now but it's gonna work for water bath so what am I do is I'm going to take this let's set it in in there and then I'm gonna heat up some water easier way to do this is to just put it in a tea kettle which is actually what I'm gonna do and I should have already done that but I'm gonna put some water in a tea kettle and get that heated up and then I'm gonna pour that water in here okay so I actually went back and put a towel in this and then set that on top of the towel and that's just gonna help that's from sliding around and kind of sloshing water everywhere so I've got some hot water in my tea color here and I'm gonna just pour this in until that water gets up preferably half of the way up the cheesecake pan so now I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna put this in my preheated oven at 350 and I'm gonna bake it for I says I think 55 to 70 minutes I'm gonna check it around the 55 minute mark and see how it's looking basically with a cheesecake you want to cook it until the outside is kind of set but the inside is still a little jiggly because otherwise you're going to end up overcooking it because once this comes out it kind of continues to cook itself and then that jiggly Center will eventually cook and then be done kind of perfectly so I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in the oven and I will be back when it is done okay guys I cook this for just about sixty five minutes and I'll show you if you can see there's a slight jiggle in the center which is what you're looking for you want kind of just this very center to have just the slightest little jiggle and kind of be set on the outside and then that will just tell you that this is done so I'm gonna go ahead and take this out of this water bath and it looks like it hopefully made it through the water bath unscathed so I'm gonna take this I'm gonna put it on this rack and I'm gonna just let it cool okay I've let this sit a good I'd say hour and a half or so and it is cooled down quite a bit so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take off the foil and then I'm gonna take a piece of plastic wrap and I'm gonna just cover this and then I'm gonna stick it in the fridge overnight you want to refrigerate a cheesecake cheesecake bars anything like that for a good four to five hours I would say minimally I like to do mine overnight give him a good 12 hours or so until I actually cut into him and that just gives them a really nice chance to completely set up and I've also found that cheesecake is one of those things that when it sits in the fridge for 12 hours 24 hours something like that it just tastes better too so I always let mine sit overnight and that's what I do with this so I even get a stick this in the fridge and then I will be back in the morning to finish it okay guys it is the next morning and also this chicks here birthday so happy birthday so we are gonna go ahead and do the ganache up for this cheesecake and all that is is just a 3/4 cup whipping cream and then some chocolate chips now I am not following the recipe for the ganache on the recipe that I'm linking down below for this cheesecake because I think those proportions are not right so I'm going to use the proportions that we use when we do a ganache and that's like I said 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream to a cup of chocolate chips so we're gonna get this heating up and you basically want to just heat this whipping cream until it kind of starts to get a little bit frothy and you want to be stirring it pretty much the whole time so that you don't burn it so I'm gonna have my daughter here stir this keep that from burning and we will hopefully and then we will be back to show you the next step okay so at this point and it's starting to get frothy so we're gonna call that good and we're gonna take it off the heat and pour it into our chocolate chips okay so I've got a cup of chips here some minis and some regular and I'm gonna just stir this until all those chips get melted and we have a nice finish okay guys and that is a ganache so what we're gonna do is set this aside and let it cool a little bit before we pour it on the cheesecake wow that is cooling the ganache we're gonna take more of these peanut butter cups and we're gonna chop them up and I'm gonna kind of chop them in a little bigger pieces because these are gonna go on the top and I just think kind of a bigger piece it's gonna look good so I'm not sure how many's we're gonna use that's what's in there probably at least half of those she wants chunks she says so that's why we have Bella this is what we have a chunk over here yes so this is what we're gonna throw on top and I might change that but that's what it's gonna look like right now okay and here is the cheesecake after it has set all night in the fridge and I do want to point out that the bottom of this pan is super super greasy which is why I've got it sitting on this foil like you can see some of the grease there it kind of leaked through when it was cooking so super greasy but now I'm gonna take a knife and I'm going to just kind of go around [Music] oh it smells so good a pan here because you're cutting it now you can smell smells coming up yeah kind of try to loosen this I don't know how well this is going to come out of here to be completely honest but we shall find out yeah I don't care as like I said it has been it has been a while since I've made a cheese cake like this I do a lot of cheesecake bars and that kind of thing but an actual cheesecake it's been a while so now we're gonna just flip this little app chair and loosen this and pray that she comes out okay now we're gonna lift this up okay beside there as you can see did not come out the cleanest well but that's okay because it's gonna taste amazing I can tell by just smelling this okay guys we are now gonna take the ganache here and we're gonna just pour it on the cheesecake it is cooled enough I probably could have let it cool a little more but we're gonna just go with it we have the soothing sounds of Bella back there if you hear the hahaha she's cleaning up our floor I'm gonna just take a spatula and kind of spread this out and I want to get a little bit of it I'm rolling off the sides or dripping off the sides a little bit but not too much so just kind of let it push over [Music] that's what we're looking like little messy but that worked out pretty good no we're gonna take our chopped creases here and I'm gonna just kind of sprinkle them on the top [Music] [Music] so I think I'm gonna cut up just a few more Reese's into kind of small pieces who would that rank and then have those sort of sprinkled on there too just for a little more aesthetic look so I'll do that and I'll be back so I'm chopped up some more Reese's hair and like I said I'm gonna just kind of sprinkle those up here just to make it have a little more dimension than just the big chunks she wanted big chunks but it's gonna have bowls hahahaha little chunks and big chunks and I think that just kind of gives it a nicer look to be honest I like a big guy like him chunky good I love that song that's for Madagascar for Madagascar it is always stuck in my head I love at that song okay the rest on here okay guys and that is it I'm gonna call that good I think um that is our chocolate peanut butter cheesecake for my kiddo there all right I just want to say that she worked really hard on this and she did an amazing job so I'm get turned out I'm just glad the water baths worked that's all I can really say I'm glad that worked cuz again cheesecake in general is not a really difficult thing to make aside from the water bath it can be intimidating but it's uh it's really not all that difficult other than that so here in a second we're gonna cut into this and show you what it looks like inside and then I will have her take a taste of her birthday cake okay so now we're gonna cut into this bad boy and let her try it there is the piece so that is what it looks like inside see those nice little chunks ooh Reese's in there super creamy looking oh my gosh this looks so good okay and I can't eat it that's why I'm saying that okay so I'm gonna take the camera and then I'm gonna let her take a bite of that I'm excited let's try yeah that you're gonna get married by that chunk there is that heaven in a bite is is so creamy and peanut buttery and cheesecake it's so good and with the nosh adds like that that like bittersweet came to it I guess no semi-sweet chocolate yeah yeah all just all comes together very well we get some crushed it there oh yeah if you didn't get any trust see what you think of the crust hmm yeah oh yes success yeah very success are you happy with your birthday cake yes all right good okay guys that was our cheesecake chocolate peanut butter cheesecake apparently it is a success I am NOT gonna be eating any of this cuz I'm trying to be good on my diet but I might have some on my cheat day if it lasts that long so I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and I will see

and ponies for Christmas and I've just had it sitting there for forever and you know what I think deep fried a is a great great time to do this why not I said so where we I did it could you lose Reese's whoa oh that's you that is that is a big mall bugger second movie who do we have Reese's this thing already has a lot of hats yeah I'll say Howard back feeling watch me you need a back brace watch me oh look it's like a death dirt I hope I didn't get any of it on the lens right Oh be careful well that escalated quickly yes it did escalated all into the bottom of the brand okay whoa well that's never a good phrase like yeah that chocolate melts it's a drippin everywhere and that peanut butter is yes get under it get under it how was your immersion bank that's got like the crisp like you don't get a lot of the batter but what it does do let's just add the next row crispy texture on top of it it's very hard to eat that melting all over the place and for you [ __ ] in the comments that are typing right now you should have put it in the freezer it was in there for like half the day it's delicious however it's unfeasible as a means of actually eating a thing it feels like I'm holding something wrong like I just pick something up out of a toilet or something but here we go mm-hmm so the predominant force is the Reese's it's like stopping [ __ ] it's you know it's laying down the law we get a little bit of the crisps penis from the batter on the outside and that makes that makes it definitely better so it's better than a normal Reese's but yeah it's just like it's a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup a lot of it it's seriously oh my god it's like just pounding my my head in with a [ __ ] peanut butter and chocolate but yeah the deep fried helps of it somebody crashed in terms of something it's bleeding in the ER I thought this was going to be terrible because of all the oil but it is the delicious Reese's Peanut Butter Cup they're just huge and when you deep fry it and you add that little crispness around it I wouldn't recommend it because after eating one you're gonna be at the cemetery that's really [ __ ] good maybe you can do the tiny ones and put them on little Sammy that's really amazing I recommend it you only live once die when you're 20 that's okay dad this is excellent you guys just eaten it wrong in the first video Reese's save some in your

[Music] you [Music] do all right guys so here's the finished product of our protein peanut butter cups now i use the new granite supplements protein powder and the peanut butter flavored but i also recommend you trying the vanilla flavor as well because i feel like it would be a nice little twist on the peanut butter cups so i'm going to try one i just want to show you how you know you just pop

thank you for watching for this video we are gonna do a taste test on Lily's milk chocolate style peanut butter cups peanut butter cups keto friendly peanut butter cups so here we go brand new products this is right on top alright so Leaney is well known for their sugar-free chocolate I'm glad that they're moving beyond just chocolate bars they're actually coming up with different products I also saw their chocolate-covered almonds this one right here I'm excited about because I do enjoy the Reese's peanut butter cups so it seems like this is gonna be a good alternative to those again Lily's doesn't use sugar they use stevia and erythritol it's a good mix especially when you're trying to replace a flavor of sugar I found this one in Whole Foods and it's actually seven dollars and 49 cents which is actually not too bad obviously they're way more expensive than the regular Reese's peanut butter cups but for somebody who maybe has trouble digging taquito because of the sweets there's gonna be a nice alternative remember you don't want to overdo other sweets on keto just because it won't help you get rid of the cravings but once in a while is okay maybe you can even consider them a cheat meal before I open these up let me get into the nutritional facts so one serving is considered two pieces which is 30 grams and this bag right here has three total servings each serving is a hundred and thirty calories 11 grams of fat 15 grams of carbs which six are fiber and seven are red throat also 15-13 as to net carbs that's actually outstanding and it has 3 grams of protein now the top ingredients here are cocoa butter erythritol peanut flour on sweeten cook cacao chicory root fiber and dextran and it says non-gmo dextran that's good alright so with that being put out let's get into these oh yeah okay they're individually wrapped right here so we have seven so that's two of them on one serving we have six of these so we each get one I'll play these for visa and Megu for later on well I like that they're individually wrapped that we can just throw in your bag and boom leave the house this is 40 percent cacao nice it seems nice and creamy chocolate just by the texture just touching it you can see my fingerprint it's done oh my gosh that's so creamy oh there's the peanut butter right there it does have the stevia after tape it feels a little too sweet for me but the peanut butter has a really nice flavor I have the really nice texture is also very creamy chocolate is nice and thick it's extra sweet for me though so she likes it Candi neither texture though is so nice so creamy I think if they will put just a little bit less stevia or erythritol which everyone whatever the ratio that they use is it would have been a lot better for me personally I love the creaminess though it just feels really nice it just kind of covers the whole tongue I think that if you have a problem with the stevia acetate you might kind of taste it on this one it might not be your favorite my wife is like that she doesn't really like the aftertaste of stevia so I'm not sure how she's gonna feel about these she's not here right now otherwise I would ask her but I don't mind that taste so much I do recognize it though and yeah it's not crazy strong I don't think it's just a little bit too sweet for me if I'm being honest I probably prefer the chocolate-covered almonds that Lily came out with it seems that around the same time as these but they both taste good I just like the sweetness bitter levels that the chocolate-covered almonds have in comparison to these right here but yeah I think they're great good especially if you have a sweet tooth especially if they help you stay on keto I recommend them if you have a sweet tooth for sure I personally probably won't be buying too many of these just because of that over sweetness and so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did hit that like button also if you haven't already please subscribe to this channel I got a bunch of videos coming up let me know in the comment section below if you know any other products that you want me to do a taste test on because you

[Music]", "PztsMzRNWOo": "whats up guys its Max Barry and this is Becky and this is how to make healthy peanut butter cups first we're going to make the peanut butter cup filling and then we're going to make the three ingredient chocolate. protein packed with protein powder, gluten free and sugar free, so let's get into the recipe right now the first thing we got to do is make the peanut butter cup recipe filling Becky's going to mix up it's only two ingredients right now our four tablespoons of peanut butter and four teaspoons of protein powder mix them together we're using max's best bootcamp protein powder and this is a vanilla flavor but if you don't have that available to you use your favorite brand all right so now just grab your silicone muffin man and we're going to scoop the peanut butter filling into four of the individual cups now you guys may be asking yourself why are we making this separately and putting its own mold so Becky what's the deal with this I tried doing it first without something in the freezer and then it's just a base sticky mess so if you want to make this nice and easy put them in the freezer and then they pop out if nice little disc perfect for your inside of your coach that's a pro tip now we're going to put these in the freezer while we make the three ingredients Auklet let's make this 3-ingredient chocolate Becky take it away two tablespoons of melted coconut oil and we're going to add to it eight drops of liquid stevia this is vanilla flavored but you don't have to use vanilla you don't have it and you can use any sweetener of choice that you like guys so we're using the stevia liquid extract you can use any sweeter you want or none at all but that would be pretty hardcore okay and now we're going to take this and add it into four and a half tablespoons of cacao powder now we're just going to stir now that we've got the chocolate ready it's time to assemble we've pulled the peanut butter discs out of the freezer and we're going to put this all together for you right now take a small amount of the chocolate and scoop it into the bottom so we're creating like that bottom layer that's right and then actually you're even going to roll it around a little bit if you want to get some of the chocolate up the side and this is the key part this is why Becky came up with the technique you can just pop it in and then cover it and you're good to go that's right so genius idea I'm really amazed it all right let's hop it in so just take that disc put it right in the center and then we're going to cover it up with some more chocolate now I know it's tempting to just eat these right now but we're going to throw them back in the freezer for a few minutes until they're totally solid so while those are in the freezer we just wanted to give you guys a couple of other ideas how you can spin this recipe because we're doing a peanut butter cup recipe and that's a base recipe so you can totally swap these ingredients out oh my favorite Oh dangerous da coconut butter no good peanut butter yep if you guys have not had coconut butter it's not coconut oil it's coconut butter legit Billy is right out of the jar yeah this is also cool this is justin and they make these like single-serving packets and actually that's right cute cut this is not for two cups so it's cool because that's all you get and then you don't have the rest of the jar to worry about where you know might keep going honestly and though all these are unsweet and make sure you get that and then you can interchange it with different protein powder flavors we have our vanilla max best we can't protein vanilla flavor toasted almond you can actually use peanut butter flavored protein as well you can use chocolate I mean uses endless yeah what other ideas do you guys have post those down in the comments we'd love to know your ideas and how you make these let's check in on the ones that are in the freezer alright guys they're ready fresh out of the freezer we're going to try these things right now yeah so in you can use we use these muffins ridges that you know makes it look like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheers let's take a bite that's good it's so rich like the chocolate I love it and the peanut butter I literally thought that this was like a Reese's just now yeah it's really good, even better like it's better it's so rich guys oh my gosh so anyway we hope you like this recipe these are absolutely phenomenal you are going to love this healthy peanut butter cups recipe don't forget to post are any of your ideas or

again really easy recipe something you can kind of like whip up and then basically store in the freezer or store in the fridge and basically uses like to go like a grab-and-go because we're all busy with like work kids you know like all that kind of stuff so it makes life so much easier when you have like stuff ready and prepared so if you guys don't know me my name is lindsay and i am from fit

sure to give it a thumbs up and that way i will make more videos like this in the future so let's get started with the very first recipe because like i said you guys are gonna freak out when you find out how easy this recipe is to make so let's get started right now so the first recipe we are going to make is the homemade reese's peanut butter cups and you guys this recipe is so freaking good honestly it's like the mama.com so we are going to be making the chocolate for the top and the bottom of the reese's peanut butter cups so in this recipe we are going to be using coconut oil so this is virgin coconut oil this is i mean you can just get this anywhere at your local grocery store and in this recipe we are going to be using a third of a cup of melted coconut oil next we need some cocoa powder so this is just regular cocoa powder it's not hot chocolate it's just like the regular bitter cocoa so we need one tablespoon of cocoa powder in our chocolate recipe next i like to add some protein into my chocolate because i like to add protein to basically everything this is ladybosslane it is vanilla cake flavored and it tastes freaking amazing it is a gluten-free grass-fed whey and honestly is like my favorite shake it's only 100 calories per scoop so that's like a total bonus it is great for weight loss immunity support craving control and digestive health so in this chocolate recipe we just need one scoop of the ladybustline vanilla cake flavor then we're gonna mix that up and initially i like to use a fork just in case like there's a few clumps in there from like the protein powder so mix it up and then i kind of convert to a spoon after that and then you need your muffin tin liners thing and then you just need to add a little bit of chocolate you know this is like the bottom of the reese's peanut butter cup so we're just going to add a little bit of chocolate into each one of them now this chocolate that we made is going to be used for like the top and the bottom so be sure not to use all of it then we're going to take that and we're actually gonna put it in the freezer for five minutes so while that is setting we are gonna make our peanut butter filling so of course we need peanut butter and this is just like smooth peanut butter just regular peanut butter there's no additives to it just like smooshed peanuts and so i like to use smooth but you can use crunchy if you want doesn't really matter i just like to use smooth because it's more like the reese's peanut butter cup so we are gonna be using a third of a cup of peanut butter for our filling next we're going to be adding some protein because again i like to add protein to everything so it's just ladybustling and vanilla cake flavor and we just need one scoop of that next we need some swerve so this is like the icing sugar version of swerve i like it because it's zero calories it basically tastes like sugar just doesn't have all the calories and it basically doesn't like skyrocket like your blood sugar so that's why i like to use it as like an alternative to sugar so in this recipe we are going to be using two tablespoons of swerve [Music] then we just need to add a little bit of water so we're just going to add two tablespoons of water and then we are gonna mix that bad boy up so we're just gonna mix it all up and that is our peanut butter filling it's delicious by the way so our cups are out of the freezer as you can tell the chocolate is hard thanks to the coconut oil so i add a little bit of coconut oil to my fingers and then basically you want to take that peanut butter filling and basically add it to each of the cups just kind of equally so i like to measure it out first and then basically kind of like squish it down with my fingers and because i have the coconut oil on my fingers it doesn't actually stick which is amazing so you basically want to just kind of like squish it all in there make it look pretty and yeah make it look like a reese's peanut butter cup and then after you've done that what you want to do is you want to take your leftover chocolate and you just actually want to top each of your reese's peanut butter cups with the chocolate now you only have so much chocolate so you just got to make sure that it lasts i know sometimes like i get to the end and i barely have any chocolate it happens pretty much almost every time so you just want to make sure that you actually have leftover chocolate and that you can actually like top all of your reese's peanut butter cups with your chocolate so again then you want to put that back in the freezer for another five minutes and ta-da this is what our reese's peanut butter cups look like and what did that take maybe 15 minutes not even to make these and they taste so good like i was saying before so that's what they look like honestly they look perfect to me like and they taste so good and they're like way healthier than like the store-bought version [Music] so our next recipe is some protein bars these are homemade protein bars and they are also delicious so the first ingredient we're going to be using for this recipe is some quick oats so these are just regular quick oats that i pretty much use for my oatmeal pretty much every day so we just need two cups of quick oats in this recipe [Music] next we need some peanut butter this is just like the same peanut butter i used from before just smooth all natural peanut butter so we need three quarters of a cup of peanut butter in there then we need some honey so honey kind of like sticks everything together and just kind of like brings it all together which is great so it's just regular honey i mean if you don't have honey you can always use maple syrup if you wanted to um so we are going to be using a quarter cup of honey next we need some protein so some ladybuslin vanilla cake flavored i honestly use this stuff for like actually everything so we just need one scoop of protein in there and then we just want to mix it up mix mix mix just like that and you gotta sing the song all the same time so yeah just mix it up so then we're gonna add some chocolate chips as well because you can have protein bars without chocolate chips so these are just some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and i'm just gonna be adding a quarter cup of chocolate chips to this and then you just want to keep mixing it [Music] so after all that's done you want to grab a baking dish and so what i like to do is i actually like to line it with parchment paper um just because it makes it so much easier when you're trying to take like the protein bars out of it so we're basically just going to take our protein bar mix and just kind of like put it into like our baking dish and then we're just going to kind of like squish it down and again you can just like put some coconut oil on your hands it just makes it that much easier just so nothing sticks to your hands and then so we're going to put that in the freezer for about 20 minutes kind of just like let it sit and then i just made a little bit of chocolate again so this is just like a little bit of coconut oil and a little bit of cocoa and then i'm just basically it's just kind of like it's like semi-sweet like there's really no like sugar anything to it i mean if you want to make it sweeter you could always add like the swerve but it's basically just a straight up just like chocolate drizzle and then you can just cut it into pieces it's really supposed to be into like 12 different pieces but i never actually cut it straight so this is pretty much what ends up happening it's a little messy at the end but it totally works and you can honestly you can leave these in the freezer if you want or you can just leave them in the fridge and then just kind of like grab and go they're so easy to just like grab and go so i hope you guys really enjoyed those recipes because again they're super easy super delicious and they are just downright amazing if you guys have any questions at all let me know in the comments section down below let me know if you guys have any ideas for any new videos i love using protein powder and just kind of like making it into like different recipes different like concoctions you know things like that so if you guys have any ideas let me know in the comment section down below so i hope you guys have an amazing day and i will talk to you love you bye you", "BAk0nz-zd3I": "so it seems that my food reviews are really popular the videos get many many views they get a lot more views to my Twitter puzzle videos surprisingly and I would have thought that my principles or videos would be a lot more popular but for some reason they're not they also get a lot more views than my alcohol reviews I'm not sure about the gaming videos but yeah you know I've got a lot of people saying when are you gonna do your next food review and I really enjoy watching your food review videos and stuff like that so I'm going to try and do them more often so here we have Reese's peanut butter cups this is basically an American impart so you do get you know you do get a lot of shops in the UK so on these but the important from America usually if something if something originates from America like coca-cola it's it's made in the UK if you're not I mean but these these are actually do come from the USA manufactured in the United States of America so these are really real and ice these are probably my most favorite ever confectionery so in this pocket you got three penal ball clubs the come in different sizes you can get pockets of like loads of tiny ones you can get pockets where you just get two big cups you know and the the peanut butter to chocolate ratio is that the right way of putting it differs as well you know with a lot of the bigger cups you may get more peanut boring comparison to chocolate whereas with these these particular sized ones you may get you know that there may be more of a percentage of chocolate with the peanut boy if you're not I mean you start to explain okay so let's take a bite just really beautiful and just melts in your mouth like the peanut butter chocolate ratio with these particular ones he just seems perfect to me it's amazing no really sure why American chocolate gets such a bad reputation I've heard that it's supposed to be very waxy and it doesn't melt in your mouth like chocolate from the UK but this chocolate doesn't seem how to Moxie its ultimate it's really nice you know it seems just as good as UK chocolate the only problem with them with these is that them now just add a little bit on the salty side I'm not real that keen on soul the team melt on your fingers quite easily but apart from that I think that absolutely amazing and a quite expensive dough I mean for free for free three of these peanut butter cups it cost sixty P which is kind of expensive what it is it's definitely worth it cuz it just tastes so good and I'm tempted to give these it's an out of town you know and I think I will yeah he's gettin out of Sun from me thanks for watching", "g2wALS2kZgo": "okay so about a week ago Kevin and I did a blind taste test between the Justin's dark peanut butter cup and the Newman's Own dark peanut butter cap and we went away with from that blind taste test saying that we didn't like either one of them that we wouldn't recommend them that we just didn't care for them at all so someone from Justin's saw that review and they said that it looked to them like I got a dry peanut butter cup and they wanted to send me a fresh peanut butter cup and I understand definitely how this could happen because I know for example with the quest bars Liz specifically told me she said don't buy quest bars from GNC make sure your crush from the company she said because the best quest bars are the freshest quest bars so I bomb for a strike from the company now so I understand completely where Justin's is coming from so I gave them my dress this was all through Twitter and I gave them my address this was yesterday so today I received a FedEx package in the mail they had overnighted me this package which I was blown away that they would do that inside were six peanut butter cups I have the dark chocolate these the ones I tried in the video and there's yes they sent me two of each one of these two dark peanut butter cups this is the new white peanut butter cup this is what everyone has recommended to me but we don't have them in our area yet so they said because they're new they're limited so I have two of those and then I have two of the milk chocolate and these are all organic so if the organic makes them not have quite the longer shelf-life I'm sure oh yeah I'm sure so they sent me a note on a Justin's card hi Tammy thanks so much for giving us another shot enjoy some fresh dark milk white chocolate peanut butter cups and let us know what you think this is from Giuliana and the Justin's tank so we're thrilled to be able to trial these again and these are free yes so and thank you very much for um thank you for giving us all these into each that just blown away to that you overnighted them okay so first we're going to try the milk chocolate and what are you reading these are open two cups are two hundred calories so this package is 200 calories yeah you never know when you get things at the store you know you hope that when you pick it up that it's gonna be the freshest it can be but you never know and it's interesting there's obscenities are fresh even the expiration date is still I think because they're organic they just don't have the shelf life so do you want to show here's the package that come in it's like a little shelf and it's got a little holders and they don't have the white paper random like a like a Reese's you know Ashlee we did the blonde taste test last night yeah so we didn't get to show you all we didn't get to see well she she may have shown it but we didn't actually get to look at the packaging last time so the inside looks like do you want yes please okay yeah here we go yeah actually no this is milk chocolate so you can't compare it to the dark chocolate we had dark chocolate last time yeah as far as milk chocolate goes I like that I like it it still does it of course I'm preparing to Reese's Cup but um the chocolate definitely has a different flavor it's not as strong as a racist cap definitely not as just a little bit of a bitter flavor top but that's very good I think for organic that wouldn't be what I would expect from organics because I've never had organic peanut butter either so well I have that pb2 is that organic no that's just gonna be dehydrated in your mode so hurry okay so I think that was good it was good it's so doesn't pick a risk up but it is okay this is the white chocolate this is new this fool I can't get around here it is only Wow it's only a hundred ninety calories and that's white chocolate that's crazy because normally white chocolate is more no this one does come in papers I don't know if you can see that's covered normally white chocolate is a higher calorie so that's the process may only smell good to go so there's the cup I don't know why it's so bright there's a coupon that's fine there's a coupon in the bottom try Justin's net butters find us in the natural peanut butter aisle one free Justin squeeze pie oh so it's completely free there's the there's the inside of the white chocolate cup and kind of see it's very similar to Reese's Cup there's actually two of those because you cut that in half and you get two coupons so that's awesome and we've never tried the squeeze net better so we will drop don't really taste the white chocolate very much it's not a strong taco it's very like it's not really strong either I like it and it is fret you can definitely tell the difference between things and what we go yeah cuz when when I would seem like one of my comments back then I don't remember 100% it seems like I remember to me very thick they vary and these are very soft that white chocolate it's good and it's very good it's not as strong as like a racist cap of course it's really not fair to confine those because those are full of sugar and good right but these are very good I like that and I'm sure they're fewer calories I don't know the calories on a white chocolate rinses cup but these have to be if you're at 190 calories for those that just that still surprises me okay and lastly these are the ones the dark chocolate all right there are 200 calories so yeah they're in a little tray just like the other ones were no paper wrapper it smells good I think these are super soft I mean I can okay yeah that's I can't cut it in the air if you watched the video where Ashley was cutting those she had a very hard time cutting those there's the inside and if you watch I'll do it for this one it's very soft so and that was we didn't get us off there was a bet it's awesome you know it was crispy that's like night and day I said Oh care for but I don't really like dark chocolate that much that's a bitter dark chocolate to me it's bitter but it's not as bitter as what we've had before it's not as bitter I don't think it's as bare as like Hershey's dark special dark I don't like it either though no no in it I truly you know I have to be honest I was doubting I was very skeptical just like it was dry it's like well how is that gonna change really anything but we'll try it out I was very skeptical about making any difference at all and I'm Tammis not because they sent us free ones I'm truly being honest that is a huge difference between what fresh ones what if new one is it makes me wonder what the date was on the other one we try I don't know if you took a good picture of the back to where you would see the data I'm not sure because it is on the back yeah we're underneath the calorie thing so maybe or maybe not I don't know the white chocolate ones the it's best by December 2015 so it's got a really long date on it right and the dark chocolate one is April 4th 2015 so so if you go away from this video just know that it's checked today yeah definitely check the dates that's very very important and that's for a lot of products that we've been trying lightly yeah especially the organ is natural even even the ones that are organic even Tastykake well that's really awful yeah you know you have to you have to check the day yeah we went in some place the other day it was it was already out of it it was already out of date by several days and I told the person at the store and she said well the Tastykake gal will come in and take care of it so we hope so I'll put it back on the shelf and they were still there the next time we right yes anyway it's it's very important to check the dates when you're buying stuff like this and I will I plan on putting a link to this video in that old video because it it's really not fair - Justin's and also it's not fair to Newman's Own those are kinda hard to us were very very hard and it was the last one in the box when I bought the Newman's Own it was the last one so I don't know how so so these are good the dark talking I don't like but I don't necessarily like dark chocolate the white chocolate ones good very light flavor but it was good the milk chocolate were okay for me they weren't very they weren't really strong either peanut buttery or chocolate the chocolate had a little bit of a bitter taste for me penny you like them a lot which one do you like the best probably the white chocolate out of the three just because that one had the cleanest smoothest flavor and that's what everyone's been telling me about the white chocolate I like the white chocolate the best - oh it looks good it just has a little bit better way yeah since their name they said that they hadn't gotten them out to all their stores yet so hopefully they'll get them out saying because those definitely are the best ones so thanks for watching thank you yes Justin's very very much we appreciate it", "7981flOvilY": "hey guys what's up it's nothing welcome back to my channel I had a completely different video planned out for today I was going to film a haul like a fashion haul for you guys today but I decided to wait just because it just did one so I wanted to kind of space it out a little bit and instead I have been having this really bad sweet tooth craving this week this is my third week on keto and as you know when you're on keto you cannot have sugar so I have been looking up recipes that I can just kind of do that are easy so that I could have at home and that I can do something sweet for the day that I desperately need something sweet but every single recipe that I found you needed some sort of keto sweetener or some sort of specific sugar I don't have time to order that off Amazon because I want it now like I haven't really bad sweet tooth so I came across this recipe that it's kind of like a Reese's Cup like a peanut butter cup and it's only three ingredients and you do not need any keto sweetener or specific sugars you can literally do it with ingredients that one either you already own in your household or two ingredients that you can find at your local grocery store so that is what I'm going to be showing you guys today it is Tuesday night I need something sweet I just took a shower I'm ready for bed the only thing missing to make my day perfect it's just a little a little piece of something sweet how cute are these pajamas by the way they have super cute little cats everywhere fun fact about these pajamas they are actually my mom's but I always wear them whenever I feel a little homesick so yeah I don't know I'm having a day I'm having a moment so yeah that is what we're going to be doing for today don't worry make it tutorials house fitness vlogs all of that it's going to be coming back I just kind of want to start doing more like a little bit of everything here on my channel I'm also going to be linking at the recipe in the description box so you can go ahead and do it at home I did not come up with this recipe I found that on Pinterest of course where we find everything but yeah let's go to it let me show you guys exactly what you need okay so this is what you're going to need it's only three ingredients that's why I love it so much we're going to try it because it's very easy to make we have peanut butter didn't realize that this peanut butter has black seeds but it's okay it shouldn't be a big deal you're also going to need some coconut oil and you're gonna need 100% cacao powder hope I'm saying that right and then I'll show you guys the next step what you want to do is you want to take some of these little cupcake cups or little mini muffin cups their recipe calls for 16 I was able to fit 15 so you want to have this ready because this is what we're going to be pouring in our mixture into so just half they set to the side into the mixture and it's done alrighty so over medium heat you're going to take half a cup of the peanut butter and half a cup of the coconut oil you're gonna make the two together and you're gonna mix it well in the pan and starting with the coconut oil and I'm just gonna throw that in there let it when I take the peanut butter and pour that in there as well so once to mix in the peanut butter with the coconut oil this is what we should have a very creamy mixture I'm trying to kind of shine my light that you can see very creamy very delicious looking now we're going to take 1/4 of this mixture we're going to put it to the side and then we're going to mix in our cocoa powder already so now I am mixing in the cocoa powder with the peanut butter mixture until it's nice and mixed in okay so what I am doing now is I am taking my little cupcake sheets a little of this and I'm going to take one spoonful of the chocolate mixture the chocolate peanut butter mixture and I am just going to pour that in just one spoon for now we'll add has before [Music] so now I am going to take the peanut butter mixture the part that we separated and I am going to put a little bit in these center okay so this is what it's supposed to look like so far I guess it looks nothing like the picture but I think it's the concept of it I ran out of peanut butter so that one just has a little bit that I over poured it too much of these two but that's okay I'm gonna pop these in the freezer and let them freeze hopefully they print tonight because I am hungry so but a pop these in the freezer and then I'll come back to show you guys two finished result okay so I am about to give Lawrence the key to dessert I made and he's going to raid it okay tell me what you think get a little bit of the peanut butter in the center what do you think it doesn't seem like much is it a little bitter very bad you don't like it on a scale from one to ten what I eat it it is next day I liked the little peanut butter cups kind of freeze overnight so I'm going to be trying some right now this is what they look like I did take a little piece of one that I gave to Lawrence to try but I haven't had like a full one so let's see hmm well so they're kind of bitter like it's good but it's not my favorite thing the kind of bitter you can definitely taste the peanut butter but there's still a little bitter like they're not as sweet as I thought it was going to be I feel like it's definitely an acquired taste just because of chocolate it's really bitter but it's pretty good oh it's okay so I do really like it it definitely isn't that fired tastes like it's some it's not my favorite thing I would definitely prefer to do the Lily's salted almond chocolate bar when it's just a little bit too bitter but it is good kind of definitely satisfied in my craving so yeah that is pretty much it you know what other keto recipe is you guys might want me to try give me some desserts because I'm definitely in desperate need of some keto friendly desserts that is what I crave the most like I have been craving a cheesecake so bad and I know that there are some key to cheesecakes I just need to find the right recipe thank you guys so much for watching as always please don't forget to Like share and subscribe and I'll see you guys on Saturday yes come Saturday with a brand new video", "rXDEbxCZl6E": "I am going to show you how to eat a Reese's this is what we do yep oh my god you know I did this KitKat video that everybody is obsessed with our people obsessed with that like do people care about that video yes people say we have no talent how dare they don't underestimate the talent of Kourtney Kardashian", "rS00qtRV7Ok": "hey everybody all right my name is soleil today i'll be talking about these peanut butter cups i came across from the company quest so before i get started if you hear little peter patterson background it's my dogs i just got back from work and they're really excited so all right so i came across the brand a long time ago they're known for their protein bars they have pizza they have chips they have a whole bunch of things and just recently they came out with peanut butter cups which i was really really excited about to try because there are a few brands i've tried lily and i want to say weight watchers that have also come out with keto version of the peanut butter cups so i am pretty stoked so this is the box that i got this is you can get this either from the site i also got this from amazon um it says there's one gram of sugar per serving 11 grams of protein one net carb and a serving is two cups which is also very nice there are 13 carbs and you have four dietary fibers eight erythritol so again it turns into one net carb pretty excited so you get [Applause] a whole bunch of them what do you get let me see 12 12 servings to be exact so i've opened up one of the packages let me go ahead and get close so you can see it okay let's see if it's gonna go there it goes all right all right so here we go opening it up [Applause] looks like a regular little peanut butter cup okay oh it's hard wow okay [Applause] it's good though yes it is protein a little bit of protein taste but i mean for the most part i'm kind of torn because like the weight watchers one you only get one for serving but i think that one tastes better or the better you get two per serving it's really nice and it's still really good the lilies one is a little i want to say it's bad it's just not um close to the real thing it's um very keto tasting i guess but um this isn't bad i mean when i was tasting the protein and i was like literally having to like focus on each flavor so earn that though i like it it's a little a little firm now but definitely fixes that peanut butter cup need like i ever wanted peanut butter cup this is definitely going to be it so when you so much fats in it too so i guess this would be considered a fat bomb um it's got 15 grams of fat nine saturated so i mean i think this is pretty good it's definitely very keto it's got high fat high protein low net carb one gram of sugar which is great so yes i definitely think this is really good i can see myself purchasing this again and i definitely say check it out so again you can get it off the site you can go to amazon they have it so all right that is it um i just recently also purchased uh keto glaze pecans which i'm going to be doing a video probably tomorrow on those so i will um i will definitely be posting very

virgin\nkitchen i've got a bit of a sore throat I feel like I could do an aftershave advert\nbut anyhow today i'm showing you how to make a chocolate peanut butter mug cake - good,\ngood times. Looks amazing right and I was a little sceptical\nabout making this the whole mug in a cake thing but mugs are quite interesting things\nanyway the term mug can have many different meanings I don't want to go down that route\nbut I really hope you give this a go because it is actually quite darn scrummy! Chocolate and peanut butter is my favourite\ncombo so hit pause on the video if you want to have a go at making it. Scribble them down slap them on a post it\nnote put them up there and go yeah i'm gonna make that put it on a chalkboard just have\na good go at this you will like it. First of all you're gonna want a mug obviously\nadd the dry ingredients first which is your flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt and baking\npowder just using a little kids spoon and mix it all together until it's nice and combined. Now at this stage it might feel like you're\nmaking the weirdest cup of tea you've ever made in your life well i'm British and I don't\nactually like tea but just stay in that zone and go eeeeee you'll be fine. With the dry ingredients mixed together add\nyour oil a good chunk of peanut butter and the milk then mix it all through ensuring\nyou get right to the bottom and scoop up the dry stuff get it nice and incorporated until\nit forms a nice batter in your mug. Yep so once you are happy with your batter\nit's time to cook your cake in the microwave which sounds so wrong but so right. My mind is telling me no but my body is telling\nme yes am I starting to sing R Kelly? yes I am Barry stop singing R Kelly. Anyhow put the mug in the microwave and let\nit cook round - look at that whirling mug of pleasure doing it's thing. Towards the end of it's cooking journey it\nwill start to pear up like a person looking over a fence that's when you know it's done. So what I did was place the mug onto a chopping\nboard be careful because that's hot oh like micheal jockson hee hee micheal jockson? *inserts scottish accent* hello i'm micheal\njockson i'm scottish. You know what i'm saying micheal jackson shamone\nuh yep put it on a chopping board and get a little bit of cream optional sprinkling\nof nuts then it is ready to be eaten. So that's it my friends if you enjoyed this\nvideo give it a thumbs up, share, subscribe, comment so that people can learn about my\nlovely channel which is growing so thankyou for that. But that my friends is how you make an amazing,\nit is really good! Chocolate peanut butter mug cake.", "XBYFzvvD4wo": "[Music] so we're going to add a little bit of sweetener a bit of butter and then a bit of vanilla now if you really really love peanut butter you can of course just use plain unsweetened peanut butter and cover it in chocolate but I really wanted to mimic extra sweetness on the texture that Reese's peanut butter tends to have and the reason we're doing this first is because if you just melt your chocolate and dump some warm peanut butter on top of it and add more chocolate on top wonder what happens when you try to pick up one of your peanut butter cups you've got peanut butter already oozing all over the place and if you do it this way and you show you a little bits of peanut butter in the freezer for a while you get a nice flat even layer of your peanut butter and it's much easier to make sure you get an even coating of chocolate all around [Music] Oh [Music] and when I first tried this I found that just putting in a bit of chocolate and then pressing in my frozen best peanut butter you can see how the chocolate doesn't come all the way up to the side so make sure you add your melted chocolate in and then spread it up the sides of it to keep it from happening [Music] and then forget nice smooth flat tops just tap them and shake them a bit and if the chocolates still warm enough it should flatten out on top [Music]", "_dUH8oEXoBA": "hey there it's cujo back again again with another video and today we're going to be doing anabolic peanut butter cups this recipe is inspired by the anabolic and low calorie wizard remington james though we're going to do something different obviously i'll watch rings in james's video just to kind of get an idea of how to make these peanut butter cups there's no other way to do it and while watching i saw something that i didn't like something i wasn't fond of in the video remington james was using actual peanut butter actual high calorie peanut butter i didn't see an ounce of pb2 anywhere in there why did you do this remington james why did you make this caloric sin why did you use real peanut butter and not pb2 the ultimate betrayal remixing james a recipe that could have been lower in calories even more anabolic than it originally is explain yourself remington james explain yourself just by yourself in front of me are all the ingredients i'm going to be using to make this and a bowl of peanut butter cup first we have the peanut butter powder this thing is a must in the recipe we have pre-made chocolate cups for two cups or 60 calories insane we have my chocolate peanut butter protein powder almond milk and new today is brown sugar by truvia so instead of a brown sugar version this thing's incredible let's make some peanut butter cups [Music] [Music] now that i've finished filling the cups i'm gonna be putting them in the freezer for a few hours to kind of solidify and get that peanut butter cup texture that we're looking for these are the peanut butter cups they're john and god do they look good look at that an actual peanut butter cup look at the texture there the best thing about these is that you can leave it in the freezer for as long as you want and it doesn't freeze it stays thick and peanut buttery it's very strange but somehow it just works out it's time for the best part to dig into these peanut butter cups oh my god the perfect texture i wish i could just feed these to you myself they are so damn good now this video isn't throwing any shade towards the anabolic wizard himself sure i tweaked the recipe a bit and i added the peanut butter powder instead but i guarantee it would taste the same regardless this thing is absolutely mind-blowing okay it's like a peanut butter cup but it's bigger no boy is it thicker thank you for the recipe remington james i couldn't have done it without you if you're craving for peanut butter cups this is the thing to go with so much protein so much more filling you're getting a bigger peanut butter cup like why wouldn't you make this thing that's it for the video guys i have nothing else like the video if you liked it subscribe for some of that more quality content until next time cujo is out [Music] [Music] you", "_u6CDMSUEiY": "you know what cock-blocking everybody your boy Barlow's Bacchus today I have a very special video for you guys last time I was in this kitchen you know what I got up to I made a huge Hershey's chocolate bar and I was reading through the comments and I saw a lot of comments saying bungalows you try a different type of chocolate bar so today is the day where we are going to be making yet another massive chocolate bar before we get started I like it a huge shout out to my boy chat with the J behind the camera hey guys I thought let me just yet alright lagunas you already know what time it is it is time to get started we do not like the wait time in Bongo kitchen before we get started though we need to do one little thing and jazz runs let them know what they got to do go down below some mash that's up on guys that's right not stuck thumbs up bye guys last night my house for 3,000 like then we blew that out of the water in the first day so this time let's try to get 5,000 like on this video and I will do yet another DIY a giant rocks bar today what we're going to be doing is a huge Reese's Cup peanut butter thingamajiggy what what do you think love peanut butter cups baby peanut butter cups we are making a huge peanut butter cup so chef bongos showing us the secrets of the butter cup next time today we are not making a big chocolate where we're making a delicious peanut butter cup show me the cup are you guys ready just see all right so what we have here is an 11 inch tart trace and this is going to be the base of our Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so let's follow these simple instructions and let's make this giant chocolate bar alright that's the first step to making your huge DIY wreath peanut butter cup and obviously to melt your chocolate so right here I have about one legs of compound chocolate guys we are no longer rookies in the chocolate making industry we now have the knowledge to make huge chocolate bars on a regular basis so guys I did my research last time we are using Hershey chocolate this time I'm using compound chocolate buttons guys compound chocolate is a major key and that's because when you melt your chocolate your compound chocolate is a huge key because Bowl it's called a huge key it's a major dealer I love that go back leg on say call is a major key not because when you melt your compound chocolate it sucks way better than milk chocolate milk chocolate hot cocoa butter compound rocket is specifically designed to be melted impressed in whatever shape you want so first step in the kitchen is to boil your hot water and that's what we're going to use to be melting our chocolate so we're going to use the same trick we did last time guys pot of hot water on the bottom a nice little clock oh hello first step is melting your chocolate hey here's me alright I've got to reset a little bit we have a new pot of water we're going to give that guy a couple minutes that way you can start melting our chocolate but as always in bongos kitchen we are efficient we are organized so right here we have our tartrate guys this is a major key to making your peanut butter cups so what you want to do is pop that doesn't do that crumb I love that here so guys you want to take the bottom of your tart tray all right this is going to play as the base out of your peanut butter cup so this is a very important step Rob your Marchman Baker you wanna grab a nice piece of Barnet papers what covers this guy like so now if you're saying bong bong it doesn't fit do I ever have a trick for you now what you want to do is you actually just want to fold them on top of each other make sure that it stays and not what you're doing is you're just folding it around the bottom of the tart tray so that is going to serve as a protective layer when you melt chocolate chocolate tends to move a lot so what it is going to do is going to serve as an extra protection so that the chocolate doesn't seep through this so now this should fit in perfectly right here then here this is our first major step into making our DIY wreath peanut butter cup so it's clean we'll catch you when the water is boiling alrighty guys so as you can see the water has come to a boil we are now ready to melt our chocolate this is my favorite part of the performace work come back take your empty pot put it right on top of the water and now we want to load on our chip guys don't be shy with the chip ratio here all right this is going to serve as our base and a little bit as they're surrounding so we're going to take a little bit more than us and we are going to start the melting process this shouldn't take too much time guys oh here we go baby no wasting time in this kitchen let's go you know this is melting way better I swear to god I'm on chocolate melting Road on some satisfactory compilation here and when you do it this way guys it doesn't burn the chocolate which is the major major healer this is melting way better than her she's gone by the way better I think it's because of the compound chocolate guys like I said compound chocolate you know side long ago this is what it takes guys you look at the risk of the rich give it a little once you mix those get those chunks out there and get those chunks out cuz as you can see they're still a chunk little chunk oh this is amazing hey cool boom take this off the hot water let that sit for literally 20 seconds guys you don't want to sit for too long now why am I putting it on the side and I'm letting it sit because I told you I'm no longer a rookie we don't want it to be too melted if it's too melted it's going to be sued tartrate DIY is done we're going to get a 20 to 30 seconds to just cool off a little bit so I can get a little bit of structure then we can make our base pretty ready I'm [ __ ] ready ready let's get this base going guys so what you want to do is now grab your tart drink place it on the side keep it real close to where your chocolate is you want to grab your chocolate you only got one charger not one shot eat now you want to pour that chocolate here Oh baby that's amazing now that the chocolate is in the tray what you want to do is create a nice simple layer yo whose technique is this rodas nice of chocolate all around you guys want to spread it evenly but notice how I'm also starting on the sides here that can serve as our rigid rim for our peanut butter cups so we actually do want to get the sides but we do want to make it as even as possible now do you guys remember this from the last chocolate yeah why what we want to do is actually just I wanted to what that will do is actually even out the surface a little bit and now we can continue with our spatula again and just make sure that it's nice and even and we want to get as close to the edges as possible guys as you guys can see I tried to take as much chocolate and put it on the circular edge you guys will see why I did that toxic later on in the DIY since we are using a tartrate like I said we might get a little bit of chocolate seeping out so what we want to do is be super careful while we're picking this guy up put it on a paper towel now that is ready to put in alright alright this isn't working alright here we go fog just like that it's in the fridge guys we're going to give that guy a nice hour hour and a half to cool down and we will be back to get the peanut butter cup going alrighty guys so we have left to reach peanut butter cups in the fridge for about an hour and a half Joe and I actually went to get wings with David Charlie's gonna be our key I won these guys I have high hopes that this work I needed the chocolate to be a little bit more you know a little bit more sturdy on the edges so I'm very worried about the sides but nevertheless the show must go on so let's check up yes alright now we're going to carefully take this guy out look at these edges so this was exactly what we wanted to happen you see how we have a little bit of an edge there I need you guys to plant a thumbs up on right now because this is the tricky part we need to take this guy out of the tart tray right now here goes nothing oh you're soul of your soul Cho Cho Cho why push it up on the bottom that's what I'm trying that's on track I have my fingers on the bottom here I'm gonna try to push it up slowly take your time take your time Oh Oh guys I'm stressing out right now wow that was amazing also okay okay take your time take your time oh oh oh yeah make that circular motion oh my god oh my god put my hand under look at that peanut butter cup now the hard part is to get this off this tray she longed again those Angleton oh that was a nice sound I think I should be able to slide it out finish oh all right see that were looking for that's good money yeah my please go the bottom come on Reese peanut butter cups guys take a look at this I know what went wrong here guys essentially the chocolate was a little bit too hot when we were making that edge it's okay we will take that minor else so now gently put this back in the fridge because you don't want this across here all right guys and although we got the cup out of the mold we're actually going to be using the mold to make the peanut butter filling so what you want to do is you want to grab a empty bowl all right you want to start off with about half a kilo of peanut butter just once a ball bar got this peanut butter it doesn't have to be name-brand save your money grab your peanut butter and essentially what you want to do with this guy's dump it all up into your bowl oh here so grab a spatula you don't want to waste any other peanut butter obviously without the peanut butter there is no peanut butter cup more already guys so now we've emptied the peanut butter into the bowl what you want to do is you want to take an equal portion of icing sugar and blend that with your peanut butter essentially we have a 1/2 kilo of icing sugar as well and guys all we want to do baking soda baking soda I got baking soda baking soda I got baking soda that's a lot of baking soda no that is a where does the peanut butter go what being a butter alright guys want to end yeah I'm show a [ __ ] trust me all right you got to trust the Baker's man you know I come up with crazy outlandish ideas but guys this is the way to do it you want equal parts of peanut butter and icing sugar we got some melted butter here we will throw that guy right in here and now we are ready to get to mix and baby one bit work so here we go now we want to gently start mixing this guy up your layer of icing sugar is going to devour to be very careful or this is going to go everywhere I'm telling you right now that icing sugar fan the peanut butter is old I'm ready for the Baker's man to prove me wrong bake I'm going zero way there's really and now we're actually going to adopt a different method now that we got that it takes the jewels off yes so jewels off beep all right and now we're going to get a little bit dirty essentially you guys are trying to need a sting of dough pretty much it's going to feel like dope but it's going to be just peanut butter and icing sugar obviously get in there with your hands and look at that you see that peanut butter color start to come out and that's what we're going to go use it that's going in as our peanut butter filling so we've been going out this guy for about 5-10 minutes now as you can see it kind of looks like a dough this is the exact consistency that you guys want it look at that now it's time to do our peanut butter cup filling guy so what we want to do is we want to grab our tart mould and now we're going to start filling this guy on the bottom with peanut butter filling we're going to grab our filling and we are just going to toss it in one time just like that now guys like I said it's like a nice doughy mixture so what you want to do is knead it get it nice and deep kind of like you're kneading dough into a pizza pan we want to get it as even as possible keep it going around town now you guys are probably asking bongo bongo bongo why are you going all the way to the edges do I ever have a surprise for you so guys you actually want to get it as close to the edges as possible because we're going to be using one simple trick to make sure that your peanut butter filling actually fits right inside of your cup that wants it okay so you see how our tray is two pieces essentially what we want to do you want to pop that guy off ever so gently now take your time here because you don't want to ruin what you've done oh my god no I need to do something with that yeah yeah yeah I don't know okay I got you I got your here here Oh so as you can see the crust is actually coming around the edge we don't want that we're actually going to take the knife and just carve around the circle guys here oh so it's like a smooth circle yeah continue cutting move that around and roll that's clean one more chopped off like so bro now clean now clean us up thanks bunk we got ourselves some peanut butter filling so now that we have our peanut butter filling on the side Oz guys bottomless kitchen efficiency organization I've already turned the heat up on the water guys we're actually just get up here add more chocolate alright now that the chocolate is underway we can forget about Saigon for just a sec let's focus on our peanut butter filling so guys like I was saying so this is the dough it just come off all as one piece but I don't want it to break so what I'm gonna do I'm going to flip it oh my god I was not expecting that and I'm going to try to pull it off on the bottom Oz to go here we go whole can go baby gonna grab the cup ever so gently here we are we're gonna put the parchment paper piece box into this mold essentially what we're going to do is we're gonna put this guy right back into place perfect wow this is in place Oh bro I got your back like a pizza dough you are Oh robot you use your key that's it perfect broke here and now you want to put that on the side on we actually want to leave our loads of chocolate to cool down for a little bit guys if the chocolate is hot at this point in the DIY it'll ruin your peanut butter cups so you actually want to give it a little bit of time and then we are ready to pour our final layer of chocolate into our DIY Reese's giant peanut butter cup stay tuned alright guys you know we're waiting on the chocolate to cool down what y'all stop all righty guys so we have left the chocolate to cool down for like four five minutes as you can see the chocolate is a lot thicker consistency now it's not as melted now it is time for our final four guys this is the most important part of the DIY what we want to do is cover the entire cup with chocolate so here we go we're going to carefully pour our chocolate over and we're going to start on the side here ball all right side you want to take your spatula you want to start blending that in as smooth as possible make sure you get the edges roll Europe [ __ ] moon where you did that perfectly major key alert once you guys are done layering it up at all you want to grab another piece of parchment papers you want to take that piece of parchment paper and lie it down on the surface make sure the parchment paper is way bigger than your tear trees now you want to grab your tart trick and you want to move it over right here you want to take a smooth surface you can use a ruler I'm going to use a knife be careful if you're using a knife and what you want to do is you actually just want to take it at the top and make that as straight as possible you want to give us that one two bang trick and now it should be nice and smooth want to take this guy off the excess chocolate plate put it on the clean one we can now take our we have butter cup very careful you guys and back into the fridge it goes you want to give that guy like 20 minutes to set we're going to take it out and leave it sit in room temperature for about half an hour already guys so we've taken the resep right out of the fridge we've let that guy sit on the counter for about half an hour and now it's time to see if our DIY works so now what I think I wanted you oh we're already doing it perfect well I think you know bite so okay oh it's like on my hand you go oh my all the way I make it do the arms which yeah oh my where all your savage guys look at that buttercup okay are we ready yes Oh oh my god bang ha look at this thing look at this

me know if you have tried this are you going to try it were you excited like me and will you be a little bit uh disappointed like me a lot of questions [Music]", "Lh6ILxpzV0M": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to the channel um today we got a package in the mail a box of quests peanut butter cups like greasy's cups but low carb but i think they were 24 for this pack and it's 12 packs 2 cups 13 total carbs 8 erythritol and uh four fiber so one net carb and then we go over here to ingredients whey protein isolate erythritol unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter peanuts palm kernel oil soluble corn fiber sodium it does have sucralose in there but it says less than two percent so not too bad um i don't think those ingredients are that bad considering what it is and it's got this fancy little box cut out there you go now we look professional so there's the size you're looking at you know it's pretty comparable i think to like a reese's pack and there's our cup not bad it kind of has a little bit of that chocolate bitterness i guess when you get into that really uh pure chocolate for sure it doesn't taste like a reese's cup so um i would say uh hold your expectations in check but this is delicious it just has kind of that dark chocolate you know aftertaste um maybe that's just because i'm just not a big fan of dark chocolate i don't know it's pretty rich i think so i don't think you're gonna be as tempted to try to eat like three or four packs of these i think you're able to eat one every once in a while as kind of a little snack and i think that's really the intended purpose of this um if you are buying these that should be your mindset going into it is that hey just a little you know a little snack here and there um one net carb not going to break the bank on your on the carbs and it's pretty good but anyway i think that's gonna be it guys um i would definitely uh i would definitely check these out if uh if it's something that you think you'd be interested in they're definitely worth uh worth buying if you don't mind spending them the money you need that you need that chocolate that chocolate fix but personally i i like my little chocolate pecan clusters and i just don't think that these are gonna replace it so i'll probably still stick with that um they are good and i'll definitely eat them all and then one package at a time hopefully but it's just like most things you just really have to get creative with with your uh cooking at home because uh everything that's gonna be um low on carbohydrates the ingredients are just gonna be expensive and therefore the product itself is just gonna be expensive and you're going to run into that no matter what you do no matter where you go so ultimately it's just going to be more cost effective to make on your own but i will say these are delicious i would recommend ingredients aren't aren't too bad i've seen a lot worse um it's true one net carbs so that's it this has been the quest peanut butter cup review so if you guys like this stuff please like share subscribe if you haven't already and until next time thanks for watching", "tegPo5RR7W8": "what's up guys this is Derek

protein powder if you want more of a chocolate peanut butter taste half a container which is 2.6 5 ounces or 75 grams of a fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt one and a half tablespoons or 24 grams of peanut butter if you want to cut down on the fat in this recipe you could just use powdered peanut butter instead and last 1/2 a cup or four ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk regular milk or any other milk substitute now go ahead and mix everything together after you mix everything together wrap it up and put it into the fridge overnight and there is your peanut butter cup overnight

Halloween Reese's peanut butter cups and here are the ingredients that we need so I have 1 cup of Hershey's chocolate chips 1 cup of icing sugar one cup of peanut butter I have some Halloween themed Smarties here there aren't actually Smarties friend but we've got the nice orange and black going on and also the orange wafers and both of these I got at the bulk store we also need these tiny tiny little paper cups so that's it for the ingredients so let's get started so I've taken my Hershey's chocolate chips and melted them down and our next step is to just get them into the little paper cups so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna start putting just a little bit in each cup this is gonna be our base so just put enough in to cover the bottom so I'm gonna continue doing this and I'll be back when I finished all these then I'm just going to take them and bang them down now if you don't have a little container like this you can just do them without the container so you can just fill them very carefully just like that and then just tap them down like this just to get them all flat so I'm I've got a little container here and I'm just gonna get them all nice and flat there we go beautiful so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna pop this into the fridge for about 10 minutes just so that the chocolate firms up so while our chocolate is cooling in the fridge I'm just going to get the next step point so we're gonna combine our peanut butter with our icing sugar and we'll throw in our icing sugar then we'll start combining that very slowly so I'm just on speed number one here I just want to combine this some recipes you will see they add in a little bit of butter you can do that if you wish for today's recipe I am just using peanut butter and icing sugar at this point it's pretty well incorporated so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get my piping bag with a nozzle and I'll be back I'm gonna get my pastry bag loaded up with our mixture smells good so at this point our chocolate is nice and chilled so I'm gonna bring that out of the fridge and what we're gonna do is we're gonna start piping a little bit of this mixture into each one here we have our nice chilled chocolate molds so basically what we've done we've filled just a little bit of chocolate in the bottom just so that we have a bottom layer of chocolate so there we go now I'm going to take our mixture and I'm just gonna pipe a little bit in the middle of each one you can see why the piping bag makes this so easy because this would be a lot harder and a lot longer to do we were doing this by hand with a spoon and put in as little or as much as you want okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna pop these back in the fridge for about 10 minutes just to chill the entire mixture down now that everything has chilled down I left this in for about 10 minutes in the fridge I just want to just push this down all the little tips I find this easier to do when it's chilled because it doesn't stick to your spoon as much very beautiful our next step I'm going to take our chocolate again this is the same chocolate and I'm going to start filling some of the tops of these I'm not going to fill all of them because I'm going to show you what I'm gonna do instead and there we go and then I'm just going to bang these down just like that but our last step is to put our little orange candies on the dark chocolate so we'll just pop these on there we go all right the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take some of these orange candy melts and I'm going to melt them down and then we're going to fill the top of these ones so I'll do that right now I'm just going to go heat up these candy melts and okay I've heated up my orange candy melts and I'm just going to get those now on the top of the remaining peanut butter cups there we go and what I'm gonna do now is just kind of before I just want to get these even though there we go and now this time for contrast we're going to take the black ones and pop those on and voila so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop these into the fridge and I'm just going to let them chill down so my Halloween peanut butter cups have been chilling for Oh 20 minutes or so and I just wanted to show you I'm sure I'm gonna camera here and you just peel them back and there you've got your Hershey's chocolate you've got your peanut butter filling and your Halloween candy top and there we go don't those look great mmm-hmm not as good so there you have it my Halloween peanut butter cups I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time oh and happy Halloween you", "-EeB5PTB2YI": "good morning everybody welcome back to my channel those pants were hanging there because i was wearing them yesterday um welcome back to my channel today's video

dishes but i want to organize our closet but it's just so much stuff in there i'm gonna wait for a day probably saturday when me and brian are both off that way we can do it together he can help me because all the bending and stuff it hurts my back and my stomach so yeah i might eat some almonds these are amazing so yeah we're just hanging out right now um i might take him out to the courtyard to go play because it's a nice day again [Music] venom tv and i wanted some ice cream all right guys so i'm about to do these dishes i swear but craving apple um walmart does their apples like [Music] they can buy like just regular apples but i find that when i buy them like that i never eat them so lately i've been buying them in this tub like this and it's like i think just green and red apples

there we go a quick lunch does it look pink to you guys that's weird okay anyways i made hendrix and i quick lunch i just made myself a black bean burger and then i put um barbecue sauce on it with these crinkle fries and then i have a leftover chick-fil-a sauce from the other day and i just made hendrix for chicken nuggets and french fries as well because that's his go-to meal so after all this cleaning i just did the apartment looks amazing now i'm hungry yes so it is the next day um after i picked brian up from work and i had to go um what did i have to go do i had to go look at that daycare i ended up not going to the gym i went to my parents house instead just that hendrix could see them for a little bit and yeah just to spend time with them so i skipped the gym yesterday and i think i'm probably gonna end up skipping the gym today too because i don't get off till five my mom is actually watching hendrix today kids cook um at seven so it's until like almost nine o'clock last night so i didn't end up trying the new best protein peanut butter cups vegan protein so i figured i would try for you guys this morning and then that'll be the end of this vlog what we're going to do is make like a protein shake with ice take some almond milk and i filled it up maybe like halfway with ice almond milk and then we'll take a scoop of this protein um i smelled it it smells like how all their other proteins smell like how do i explain that like it smells like a vegan protein i don't know like dirt kind of um i really like their which flavors have i tried the choco coconut um the salted caramel is really good the vanilla chai is okay it's definitely my least favorite out of those three but it's still really good it just doesn't taste as sweet as these other ones um and then what else i tried the strawberry milkshake one when that was a thing it was disgusting i hated it i threw it away it tasted like throw up to me i even tried packing it into like smoothies just to get in that protein to not waste it but it was still so nasty i just had to throw it away so i don't even know if that's a flavor anymore though because i could have sworn it was a limited edition flavor we're going to blend it up and then i'll taste it for you guys the macros on this 140 calories three grams of fat six grams of carbs and 23 grams of protein still smells like that vegan protein smell i'm scared [Applause] let's try i definitely don't taste peanut butter okay okay i taste the peanut butter it mainly just tastes sweet more than anything i don't hate it though but it definitely has that texture that their vegan protein has just a little bit of that grittiness too but it's actually really good um definitely light on the peanut butter flavor but that would be good with like half a banana and then if you added some extra peanut butter into it it would really taste really good i could definitely eat this that definitely tastes like ice cream to me that's really good i'm happy i've always wanted to try their s'mores one but i never got to and i don't know if they have it anymore i just saw jasmine post that they came out with us and i was like i have to try it so here we are and it came really quick too it came in less than a week so that's exciting but yes definitely try that out if you guys are interested um definitely oh my god i look a mess definitely a good vegan protein um with that being said i'm going to end this vlog now i hope you guys enjoyed it sorry if it was boring my little cleaning vlog but um if you guys enjoyed it don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you didn't enjoy it dislike it whatever i don't care um but i will see you guys hopefully in the next video bye guys", "OCrrkD9WaBE": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video is all about how to make low-carb high-fat Reese's peanut butter cups guys hooked I am if you want to know how to make them then just keep watching so the first ingredient you're going to need is one tablespoon of cold-pressed organic coconut oil you're going to need three packets of sweet leaf stevia this is the brand I recommend it's organic and there is no added dextrose or anything like that so we're going to use three packets and then we're going to use a little bit of Hershey's cocoa I'm going to say about a half a tablespoon so to my skillet I'm going to add a little bit more than one tablespoon of coconut oil we're going to put this into our sorry guys we're going to put this into our pan and we are going to let it melt down it's on a very low flame so the coconut oil has melted down and now we are going to be adding three Packers I just added the three packets of stevia I'm sorry the video got cut a little bit my settings I had too many things I had to erase anyway in the pan with the melted coconut oil is three packets of stevia to this we are going to add one teaspoon of the cocoa one teaspoon of cocoa to the pan and we will mix it well alright guys so the 1 teaspoon of chocolate cocoa powder unsweetened three packets of stevia and the one tablespoon of melted coconut oil is now well stirred up and we are now going to pour it into our little wrappers this is what I buy this is the mini baking cups they are itty bitty and these are perfect size for little Reese's peanut butter cups so here's how I line them up on a cookie sheet and I'm about to fill them and I'm going to take equal parts to our mixture and add them to our little baking cups alright guys so here they are filled up I made six of them out of the one tablespoon of cocoa powder and I want to show you what they look like through the magic of television yeah these were in my fridge this is what they look like I'm going to take one out and show you on the pan it is literally a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup now what I do is I add literally like a little finger tip amount of peanut butter on top and I'm going to show you there it is the little finger tip bit of peanut butter on top of this chilled Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so pretty much guys this is liquid still and you know coconut oil at room temperature gets solidified so I'm going to put this cookie sheet into the refrigerator and

watch them and I love to make them so I feel like this is a thing that should continue happening for a while and I'm sorry that my backgrounds all ugly and white and plain right now it's gonna change for the Fall I'm like rearranging stuff so in a couple videos after this one it'll be different you'll see a change of scenery soon that will hopefully be more flattering to your eyes so anyways today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make your very own it's DIY Reese's peanut butter cups at home they're super easy to do super yummy so I thought that I would share this really simple and fun DIY with you guys I really want to get to know you guys better like I consider you guys my friends and I feel like friends should know more about each other so I do like question of the days with each of my videos where I ask you guys a question and I normally ask it down in the comments below so it would be cool if you guys could answer though I think that that would be really fun to do so I could get to know you guys better and I will be commenting my responses down below as well so like today's question of the day is what is your favorite app let me know it could be a game app it could be a weird random app that has no purpose via photo editing app like anything just let me know you guys know that I get obsessed with game apps for very long periods of time so the one that I'm obsessed with right now is a game called a mystery Mac and it's a really fun jewel matching adventure game that has a mysterious twist to it basically you get to find clues and objects that are hidden throughout the game as you go through it and then there's like hundreds of puzzles for you to do and the graphics are just so insanely beautiful on this and one thing that I love about this game that's different from other jewel matching games is that it has an interactive storyline that you can be a part of and the features on this average is so beautiful and so like interesting it's just like a fun app and I'm obsessed with it so you guys should definitely check it out I will put a link down below got to definitely play it and let me know what you think of it in the comments down below so I could reply to you guys about the game because it's super fun again it's called mystery match it's completely free in the App Store and you can find it on a bunch of other stuff like Amazon 2 so I will put a link down below so you guys can check it without further ado let's just get started you're going to be needing some peanut butter some milk chocolate or milk chocolate chips you will also need a cupcake tray I chose a mini one so I'm going to be making mini peanut butter cups that you can use whatever size you want and then the same size baking cups to correspond with that so the first step is going to be to line your cupcake tray with the baking cups and once you've done that you can go ahead and set that aside the next step is going to be to melt your chocolate and there's a simple technique to do this so what I'm just doing is breaking the chocolate into pieces and then I'm just going to put it inside a ziplock bag which I'm going to put inside a bowl of hot water this is really easy and works really well so now you're going to line the bottom of your baking cup with a layer of chocolate make sure not to put too much of it inside but also make sure not to put too little of it so kind of just eyeball however much you think will be good for that then you're going to take your peanut butter and put it into the center and kind of press it down slightly but don't press it down all the way because you don't want it to show through the other side so go ahead and do that and then you're going to add a final layer of chocolate to the top which then you want to smooth out with your fingers and I didn't tell you this before but you also want to smooth out the bottom layer as well so just smooth out both the bottom and top layers this will help it just look a lot neater um so now you're just going to place this into the fridge for about an hour and yeah pretty much it once they're done they should look like this you can go ahead and take one out and carefully remove the baking cup or wrapping paper or whatever from it and tada it looks exactly like Reese's peanut butter cups I feel like and even when you bite into it you can see the peanut butter popping through and you can just do different flavors disease for different holidays and you can definitely do bigger sizes of these and I just think that this is really fun and easy DIY to do and I hope you guys liked it are you guys that was the video this is super easy to do and I think it's just such a cool thing since halloween is coming up you can make these for like a halloween party or even change up the ingredients and make them like christmas themed or whatever so it's really fun to do and i hope you guys like this and if you happen to recreate them make sure to send me pictures on my Twitter and Instagram I hope you guys like this video I love you guys I will see you in my next one so kay", "D38OQnJZ5SM": "so you will be needing mini baking cups Reese's peanut butter cups miniatures brownie mix some olive oil it says vegetable oil but I use olive one egg water a mixing bowl and of course a mini muffin pan so these are all of the things that you will need to make this project and don't forget to pre-heat your oven okay so now I'm just going to put in the mix and of course you can make the mixture by yourself if you want to now I'm adding the water and oil I always put a little bit less oil than the recipe actually says to make it a little bit healthier and now cracking the egg also a little tip is to crack it on a flat surface as opposed to one side hole slit at the egg okay so I actually added a little bit of water so that it can have a creamier consistency because you need it to like kind of hit the rhesus evenly so it just added more water and you can too okay so now I'm just gonna take up a teeny amount to cover the bottom of the like the cup basically I'm gonna take a recess and do that and it's going to actually spread out the bounty brownie batter pretty evenly and now I'm just going to cover the batter in order to make it into a brownie form of course oh and I had some extra batter so I decided to make bigger cupcakes or brownies also and this is what they look like after they've been baked and now I want to let them fully cool before I like take off the wrapper so I'm just cool and cool on this cooling rack oh and a little tip is to take them out with a little like smooth nice if you like to get them out easier and now I'm going to decorate them to make them look presentable so on this platter it says cherries berries and pears oh my and it's actually a really cute little cake platter and now I'm just going to take off the wrapper and you need to be careful with this so that you don't rip off the problems and basically only ones that will stick off and that's just a fluffy part of it and there you go this is how I decorate them and they taste so good oh my gosh", "Y92vZdIsFBg": "Reese's Peanut Butter Cup gli

look like this is a three layered bar on the bottom we have this wonderful graham cracker crust we're gonna top that with a smooth and creamy peanut butter filling and finish that off with some chocolate ganache and a sprinkling of chopped peanuts so the first thing we're gonna start with is our green cracker crust so pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then you will need an 8-inch square pan that's 20 centimeters line your pan with foil and make sure you have like a little bit of an overhang so that way when we finish our bars it's gonna be really easy to get the load of the pan you just use that as like handles so now for our graham cracker crust you can make this by hand or even the simpler way which I'm gonna do I'm gonna use my food processor so you will need one and a half cups which is 150 grams of graham cracker crumbs now you can just buy a box of graham cracker crumbs I actually prefer I think the flavors a little better and I'm gonna wife I think it's a little better when I make my own from graham crackers so for a hundred and fifty grams or one and a half cups you will need about nine and a half be technical here nine and a half graham crackers so like I'm gonna put them in my food processor here and grind them up to crumbs another way if you don't have that is what you can do is just take like a plastic bag and then you can just put your graham crackers right in there and then just take a like I'm just taking the rolling pin and just crush them that way I mean you can do with that just as easy almost but I'm being a little lazy here today I'm gonna use my food processor so just gonna break them up now if you go to the joy baking YouTube channel or the gym joy bacon calm website I do have a recipe to make homemade graham crackers so if you want to do that or you can't buy them where you live another idea is to just use digestive biscuits and then just crush those that's a alternative to green crackers okay so there and then I like to sweeten my graham crackers you don't have to but I like to add 2 tablespoons 25 grams of granulated white sugar I think just a little bit of sugar helps and then I'm just going to process this until they're finely ground yeah that looks good if you do sometimes have a few ones that don't break up this I just do with my fingers so they're just nice and fine and then we're going to bind our crumbs with some melted butter you will need six tablespoons 85 grams of butter and just melt it you can you hear you could use unsalted or salted whatever your preference now if you were doing this by hand just pour in your butter and just you know use a fork or something just mix it all together until everything is nice and moist scrape that down okay pretty easy so so this is what you're looking for if you kind of squeeze it it'll hold together if you found it didn't do that then you could add a little more melted butter sometimes if your graham crackers are not really fresh you may have to add just a touch more butter so just keep that in mind and now all we're gonna do is just press our crumbs onto the bottom of our pan you could use like the back of a spoon or an offset spatula but really I just use my fingers good sure you get in the corners there now there are two ways to set a graham cracker crust one is to just put this into the refrigerator and chill it but I for when I'm doing a three-layer bar like this I prefer doing it in the oven I find it sets it a little firmer which is what we want with the three layer bar so everyone's oven is a little different I'm gonna say then my oven it's about ten minutes the graham cracker will take on a little bit of color and be set so both ten minutes okay so our graham cracker crust is done it has deepened in color a little and if I touch it it's nice and firm so what you want to do is put your pan on a wire rack we want to let this cool completely and then when we come back we will make our peanut butter filling so now that our crust has cooled completely we can make our peanut butter filling if you have a stand mixer like I do here use your paddle attachment but you could just as easily use a hand mixer the first ingredient you will need is five tablespoons which is 70 grams of butter have your butter at room temperature for this you could use either the salted or unsalted butter and then I'm just going to beat this on medium speed just until it's nice and smooth [Music] script that and then we're making a peanut butter filling so we obviously need peanut butter you will need one cup which is 240 milliliters or if you want to go by weight 265 grams I'm using smooth peanut butter and there's two types of peanut butter there's ones with a stabilizer and then there's what's called natural which doesn't have a stabilizer and you can tell because it tends to when you store the natural peanut butter it separates into two layers for this filling I prefer to use a peanut butter with a stabilizer which is just kind of your your regular peanut butter that you buy at the store so I'm gonna beat this just until it's combined and nice and smooth [Music] okay it's good as always you know periodically scrape the sides and bottom of your bowl you want to make sure everything gets mixed together and now we're going to add I'd like to add one teaspoon four grams of pure vanilla extracts just for flavoring and then one cup 120 grams of confectioner sugar you may know that is powdered or icing sugar right in there and then a third of a cup 80 milliliters of heavy whipping cream I'm just using cold just right out of the fridge and that's a cream with a 35 to 40 percent butterfat content or what that means is when you whip it it will hold stiff peaks so I'm just going to put everything in there and then what we're going to do is start on low speed and then increase it to like medium high and I'm gonna beat this for a few minutes until everything is combined and then it gets what we want to do is make it light and fluffy and it will even lighten in color from what we start with so low speed and then increase [Music] hey so we're done so I'd probably be that about three minutes somewhere around there the more you beat it the more light and fluffy it will become you smell that peanut butter so just look what this is what it looks like gorgeous so now this is a no-bake filling so we're just gonna spread it into our pan [Music] yeah and then with the back of the spoon or I'm using an offset spatula it's going to spread this out nice and even oh these are so kind try to level the top as best as you can because we're gonna put a layer of the ganache on top so now what we have to do is to chill this until it's firm probably you know maybe a couple hours depending on how cold your fridge is so I'm just going to noise that I'm just going to cover it with some plastic wrap put it into the refrigerator until it's chilled and then when we come back we'll make our chocolate ganache for our top layer we are making a chocolate ganache a delicious mixture of chocolate and cream so in a heat proof Bowl put six ounces 170 grams of either a semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate you want to use a chocolate that you enjoy just eating out of hand I'm using a semi-sweet with about a 58% cocoa content I'm using these pellets if you're using a chocolate bar then coarsely chop it and then I have a small saucepan you will need a third of a cup 80 milliliters of heavy cream again that's cream with the 35 to 40 percent butterfat content along with 1 tablespoon 14 grams butter you can use either salted or unsalted and then I'm going to heat this up just until it's boiling and start the bubbles around the sign it just begins to foam up now you could do this step in the microwave either way just watch it carefully because then once it starts to foam up you got to grab it okay so it's almost there you can start to see the bubbles it's gonna foam ah there we go I'm gonna grab it off the heat and then we're just gonna pour that over our chocolate and I'm just gonna make sure all of the chocolate is under the cream I'm gonna let that sit maybe a minute so the hot cream can start melting our chocolate so now I'm using a whisk you could just use your spatula start in the center little circles and then just move it out it starts to come together okay you can see the hot cream really does melt your chocolate so there we have our chocolate ganache now this is still this is quite warm and so I don't want to pour a hot chocolate mixture on top of our peanut butter filling so I'm just gonna let this sit just for a few minutes just till it you know when I feel the bottom of the bowl its cooled down it's just let it sit right on your counter so now our ganache is cooled down enough the bottom of the bowl isn't hot anymore and we have our chilled peanut butter filling see so now we're just going to pour this over the top sure I get it all okay and then just take a back of the spoon or an offset spatula smooth it out looks good okay shake the pan even it out getting nice and smooth now you can leave it like this this or what we're gonna do is I have some chopped peanuts just coarsely chop them and I'm gonna sprinkle that over the top so you'll need maybe maybe a quarter of a cup of chopped peanuts it's both 35 grams or if you prefer you don't even like I said you don't even have to do this but the nice crunch on top I like and the presentation it looks good so now what we're gonna do is cover our pan and put these back into the fridge to chill I would say several hours you could even do it overnight if you like and then when we come back we will try one I let the chocolate peanut butter bars chill overnight although you could just let them chill you know three four hours in the refrigerator so now we're ready to cut them so you will need large knife sharp knife and as always you know as cut them as large or as small as you want they are quite rich so keep that in mind and then turn that cutting them and I'm just gonna take a little piece but there you have it doesn't that look gorgeous so let's try I just love chocolate and peanut butter together you know like peanut butter cups all that kind of thing these are wonderful the top I like that I'm using a ganache because it's got that cream in there which keeps the chocolate a little soft even when you refrigerate it and then combine that that the peanut butter filling I mean we beat it quite a bit so it's very light and fluffy and creamy and it just pairs pairs so well with that chocolate and then I like having the graham cracker crust there's a little bit of graininess to it which offsets the real smooth creaminess of both the chocolate and the peanut butter filling so I really think the the 3 layers is is just perfect a good thing about this you can cover and store them in the refrigerator for probably a week if they last that long or you can freeze them so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie George gave joy baking Calm [Music] you [Music]", "Z-iL2Be05T8": "Ok, today what I'm gonna do is make a giant\nReese's peanut butter cup. And to start with I just have my double boiler\nand I have some chocolate. Some Nestle milk chocolate. I have here a 23 oz bag.\nBut I only have about half of it in here right now and i have other chocolate mixed in as\nwell. And I am using a double boiler but you could\nuse a microwave instead if you want. This is going to be the first step once I get this\nmelted I am going to show you what to do next. Ok i have used almost the whole bagI have...well,\nI used about 4/5ths of the bag. now that its pretty well melted, Im gonna take it of the\nheat and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Ok now I have my tart pan. And I had it in\nthe freezer just to get it real cold just to help the process out a bit. And I put some\nparchment paper over top of it. I sprayed some cooking spray over top of it to help\nit stay on there a little better. now i take my chocolate which is melted. And I simply\npour it in. and we will see if it covers it all if not I will melt more chocolate to put\nin there. You wanna have a decent amount for the base probably if you can get about an\n1/8th of an inch or so.at least. 1/4th of an inch would be better. what I do I'm taking\nmy brush and I am just gonna brush it so I can brush it up the sides a bit. Just like\na real Reese's peanut butter cup. ok now that that's done I'm just gonna put\nit in the freezer and let it freeze for I'm guessing a half hour or up to an hour i guess\nand I will make the peanut butter to go inside. ok now we have two cups of peanut butter and\nI'm gonna take a cup of confectionary sugar and mix it in. this is gonna make our filling\nfor the for the peanut butter for the reese peanut butter cup. just like that. mix it\nin pretty good. \nok there we have it this is gonna be our peanut butter that we put into our um reese peanut\nbutter chocolate. Im gonna take the peanut butter (mixture) I'm just gonna spread it\ninside my uh chocolate. ok now the next step is to coat it with more\nchocolate. Ok i have taken it out of the freezer and even the peanut butters has hardened up\na bit. now I have made some more melted more chocolate. Im just gonna pour it in. see how\nthat does hopefully its enough. yeah I think it will be. just spread it out. \nnow just put it back in the refrigerator or\nfreezer for at least a half hour or so. ok this is the reese peanut butter cup after\nit got out of the freezer. Im just gonna take it out of its container. and remove the paper\nand see how it looks. wow! nice!", "e94sId4I6QM": "every one as you can see I'm with my mom GJ cognate mommy and today we are trying

chocolate to me it's a little bit harder I'd be better to mean this one the chocolate to me seems like they dipped it more so it's around the recent around the peanut butter cup completely and the peanut butter I take back everything I said this is my favorite William our peanut butter and chocolate ratio whoo peanut butter is even saltier than this one I don't know why it tastes like the peanut butters are different between me and the Reese's Cup same reason that serves its saltier there's more people earned chocolate and as you may know I'm not that big of a chocolate lover and so the peanut butter salt here it's also soft instead of hard like this and all right tell us which one you like and that I only come out at Easter as you know so I guess yeah hopefully you've gotten to

really appreciate it if you hit the thumbs up button let's get to the topic quest just came out with peanut butter cups so i've been i've been talking [ __ ] about quests the past couple videos because i feel like they haven't done [ __ ] in a while and then they come out with peanut butter cups so they showed you up hey they're doing something different they are doing something different i gotta give them credit um these are pretty much like a play on um reese's right trying to be a reese's with i minus all the sugar and all that other [ __ ] with protein protein so price point on these bad boys are um i've seen a pack of like four from nine bucks so like about two dollars a pack sounds about right yeah it sounds about right it really does so that's the price point um the macros not the greatest really i mean they're okay but um two cups is 190 calories 15 grams of fat 90 grams of saturated fat 13 carbs 4 grams of fiber 8 grams of erythritol and 11 grams of protein [Music] ingredients is whey protein isolate is uh as the protein source erythritol is the sweetener of course um soluble corn fiber is the fiber source and then there's a couple other ingredients it's really not that much ingredients really that's a lot of ingredients no it's not look it's just this and it stops right there and the sweetener is super loose it's actually not not that as much as i thought it would be same tray same little paper thing pretty much the same thing here except not as small there you go i think it's the same size too no reese's has downsized throughout the years all right i would know all right it feels and looks like a reese's i'd say it's maybe smaller it's not as tall no i'm pretty sure this actually might be bigger really yeah right oh thanks i was positioning it ready oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it's not bad oh [ __ ] it's not bad not bad it actually tastes kind of like kind of it's kind of it's missing that like super sweet peanut butter taste though but you know what i [ __ ] love this really yeah it's like 100 like bye-bye reese's like hello protein pcs this isn't mad damn look i love reese's like reese's is my [ __ ] i would say this is like 75 percent reese's it's like almost there what's missing that super sweet feel is that super sweet peanut butter taste i got a super sweet peanut butter taste the chocolate is not as you know in your mouth it's a little hard i'd say this it's better than most of the imitation reese's out there like the egg candy you know like the russell stouffer's and all the other [ __ ] ones that make the cups trying to be re-season [ __ ] i don't know i just stick to the basics it's one of the best imitations of trying to be a reese's i taste it this is like and this is protein stuff so this is like literally i mean i could probably taste the difference if i had a reese's cups in this yeah you know what i was actually going to do a comparison video i was going to buy reese's and do like a comparison video maybe we could do that later or sometime um this is this smacks it's pretty good [ __ ] it's pretty good i already feel biased go ahead because it's like if you like reese's and you don't want to throw away all your macros this is right there honestly like right there it's not it's not 100 there but it's right this is dangerous because i get sweet tooths i like to eat sweets and so now problem solved hey i was talking [ __ ] about quest not doing [ __ ] innovative this is kind of innovative so good job quest fantastic good job i definitely suggest trying them let me know what the [ __ ] you think if you think it's close to reese's i would say it's about 75 to 80 of reese's flavor the other 20 is kind of like its own thing type of deal um actually i think the milk chocolate might be a little bit different because what's maybe maybe given maybe giving me that that i don't think it tastes exactly like a reese's right it is different because it's very it's like thicker and it is a little bit thicker and it's like the taste is different too so maybe if they got that milk chocolate down maybe the reese's would taste more like a reese's to me i don't know it is pretty good though so ready to rate this yeah oof we've been really on point with these ratings that's not going to be on point i already know it like so no all right i got a ratings three two one nine oh wow wow i love this i like [ __ ] i will literally like wow you know what go out and buy this wow guys a 10. she gave a freaking 10. i don't even know it's not a point i don't even know where to go with this like i could i did

This recipe will make 6 peanut butter cups and you can double the recipe to make 12. Start by adding 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp of peanut butter. I like using \"Peanuts only\" because it does not contain other ingredients like sugar, corn syrup and other ingredients I can't pronounce.  Add 1 \u00bd tsp Pure Maple Syrup. What I like about this recipe is that this is a dark chocolate version which is less sweet. Line your baking tray with paper baking cups Spoon your peanut butter mixture in the baking cups.  You can choose to melt them a little in the microwave so they are easy to spoon. To make normal milk chocolate peanut butter cups, just use sweetened cocoa powder. Place the baking tray in the freezer for 1/2 hour or until the peanut butter mixture is hard. In a bowl, pour \u00bc cup of melted Coconut Oil. Add \u00bc cup of Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. Add 1 \u00bd tbsp of Honey. Mix well until ingredients are well combined. Feel free to adjust the honey and maple syrup to suit your taste.  The recipe is quite forgiving. Spoon the chocolate mixture in the baking cups on top of the peanut butter mixture. I like to add another layer of taste by sprinkling some salt on top of my peanut butter cups.  Salty and sweet! Place baking tray in freezer for 1/2 hour or until peanut butter cups are hard.

butter cups clean pretty much totally protein I was down at the low carb gross yesterday I picked up some of this powdered peanut butter stuff and I just mix it up with some water and I tried it with celery and I'm I was actually quite happy with it it's really good if I had to describe it when you just mix it with water it's like um it actually tastes more like a traditional peanut butter just like Kraft or whatever it's smooth and it's like kind of almost like a nice thing like it would work good as an icing on something so I'm gonna try that and I'm gonna mix um I'm gonna try to mix up some chocolate with this simple sex I'm gonna mix it up really thick and then we're gonna layer it in these cupcake liners and we're gonna do a multi layer process and tossed it in the freezer and see how that works out so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do four tablespoons of the syntha-6 powder and then we're gonna do two of this and then we're going to spread it out in these cups and put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes between each layer and then hopefully we'll get a nice little peanut butter cup might be an epic fail but yeah let's see what we can do anyways so let's start by making just like four tablespoons of this chocolate this is actually like probably one of the better tasting proteins out there it's not that cone or I should say clean it's clean but it's not it's not necessarily like the best protein as far as like it's not pure isolate they actually put six different kinds of protein in it and yeah I used to have like an Active Release but it actually it tastes really good I'm just gonna sprinkle some stevia in here hopefully to like sweeten it up a bit but anyways this is gonna be our our chocolate and they have to add more water but basically yeah I just want to get like a nice thick smooth consistency so that once it freezes up once it's chilled it's like it's like a milk chocolate as you can see I'm not really measuring things out accurately I'm not using actual measuring spoons you're just using these it's kind of where we're at actually looks really good a lot of guys actually eat this stuff just like this though they'll mix water with their protein they'll eat it like this just kind of like a pudding I call it sludge and that's actually a decent treat too you can just toss some like peanuts in there or like throw a couple blueberries or whatever put this in the freezer for a few minutes it's kinda like a phony ice cream but yeah it's it's good so I'm just gonna put a tablespoon of this in the bottom of each one of the cups yeah and then we'll toss that in the freezer for 30 minutes and then hopefully we can put our peanut butter on top of that it looks like cake batter something your brownie batter looks really good smells amazing - okay so these are ready to go in the freezer you're gonna toss these in the freezer that's actually maize I can taste exactly like cake butter so I'm just gonna toss these in the freezer really quick and thirty minutes and we'll pull them out and we'll put on our peanut butter all right mmm so our chocolate cups solid now like a solid milk chocolate puck in the bottom of each one of these trays so we're gonna put our our peanut butter filling on top of them and see what they look like anyways we're gonna do four scoops of this add in our water date so we got our consistency and then spread it in there so again I'm not doing really accurate measurements the key is to just mix it to the right consistency by adding water I'm not gonna add any of the stevia powder to the peanut butter because it's actually pretty sweet as it is yeah yeah two scoops of water for every nursery one scoop of water for every two scoops of peepee - those are kind of whooping keeping scoops so the top scoops of water excuse you guys an idea what this is like this stuff it's um it's a lot like peanut butter once it's mixed up we got tastes really good to just mix that up I'm gonna try to evenly distribute this into these cups and then spread it out did that one drink the same amount in each one before we flatten it out I watched one other video or tutorial but something similar to this and the person added cocoa to their chocolate protein powder to get a little bit more chocolatey I'm not a huge fan of the like strong Coco Lee dark chocolate tastes the more of a milk chocolate guy got a cheap cheap taste buds they like the cheat chocolate and so I'm just gonna now I'm just gonna flatten it out these back freezer for 30 minutes so that's that you know try to keep the peanutbutter towards the center so once it freezes up the chocolate kind of gets a chance to go around the edges I'll probably put more chopped than on top then I get on the bottom so it completely covers up all the peanut butter here softening up quick actually the chocolates melting fast at the freezer it's really warm here in Vancouver today that's why we're inside with the a/c on and and all the windows closed so and toss these back in the freezer for 30 minutes we'll do the next layer all right so I've just gone ahead and I've added my powder this cup save on some time here just add my water and stir it up for our final layer of our peanut butter cups and looking good so far one thing I was considering that will be a problem is when I go to eat these things they're basically liquid at room temperature so when you actually go to eat them you got to be pretty quick they're gonna be turning into this goo while you're eating them so that's something to consider when you're making these is they are temperature dependent and yeah I was trying to think of something like a solid food source you could like melt down or something and add to this so that they stay solid at room temperature but there's our final chocolate topping layer I'm just gonna put that on top now about our peanut butter these look like they'll be really good another problem or another thing I was wondering was are these gonna come out of the paper when I'm done and will they peel out or not once they've been frozen solid but we will find out I'm just gonna put this last layer on and then I'll put them in the freezer for the cuff for a couple hours and then I'll cut one in half and we'll take a look at what's inside and we'll do a final taste test and yeah so this is a pretty pretty easy thing to do when you were sitting around hungry doing a Content prep you'll try anything to have a tasty snack and if you can use sweeteners and you can use protein instead of carbohydrates and fat anything like anytime you can do that you're gonna pretty good treat I did realize after I started making this video that the syntha-6 is actually not the best protein for this because I didn't know this well I didn't know this but there's actually some carbs and some fat on that it's a bit of a weight gaining protein supplement it's not really um it's not like a pure ice let or anything so you may want to use just like your favorite chocolate protein powder that's like 100% Iceland that's gonna give you a cleaner a cleaner treat but um yeah this isn't something that you don't day long and saw you're treating so like keep that in mind when you're making something like this if you're doing a really strict contest breath you may not be able to eat these but anyway so that's where we're at these look really good we'll do a taste test later maybe I'll get one of my girls to do a taste test you get really candid and candid review the flavor i watch a lot of people's cooking videos on on youtube and i know what the ingredients taste like so when they finally make something and they pluto mmm so good and you just know like they're off to the side spitting it out or they're not finishing their batch but um I'll get my daughter try it and if she thinks it's good then you know it's good cuz kids can try alright so peanut butter cup has been in the freezer now for me two or three hours and as you can see I tried to peel off the happy birthday cupcake liner and I guess these are the ones that are supposed to go on the outside and it didn't peel off so we're gonna like scrape that off with our knife I cut it in half here I'm cutting my finger let's show you what we got actually just peeled off right there anyways you can kind of see peel is paper we know it's melting in my hand as I do this but we got peanut butter and chocolate paper on this corner that's really good so we're just melting here we're gonna scrape this paper off while we're multi-time we got cold it smells like an ice cream bar that's pretty good it'd be nice if the paper would I just peeled right off but I'll scrape it off with this it's making a huge mess it's just like melting on my fingers right now but it's actually a decent Street I would use a different protein source next time up here isolate and other than that that's like a pretty much a straight protein bite that's sweet chocolatey let me tap that peanut butter no that's a decent treat it actually it kind of tastes like an ice cream bar treat something you get at the freezer section at like corners are the raised pieces like ice cream bar something so I'm sorry for me having to scrape all this paper off and the huge mess it's making I'm like super and it messy now it's a messy treat really good bit of a dessert probably will 5 grams of fat in this so there was about 2 tablespoons of the protein probably one tablespoon worth of the PB 2 in there and I don't know that's all mostly mostly protein probably 75 percent protein hmm I would make is young probably worth it I still got two more in the freezer my kids are sleeping so they won't do the taste test but I'm not screwing with you these are actually good Oh boom two chocolatey thumbs up it's those kind of useless to make a clean street video without kind of figuring out the macro so I just added them up really quick here I use about a half a serving of the syntha-6 in each one of those and about a half a serving of the lippy B - so ever except - four grams of fat ten grams of carbs and fourteen grams of protein so that's like just over a hundred hundred calories of pop and 14 grams of proteins decent that's um no quite as much as like a quest bar or something but though I'd actually say I'd probably enjoy that more than a quest bar it's more like a it's a good summer like ice cream treat and yeah all cheaper to you not pay only three dollars a bar or whatever two bucks a bar water but there are these days so give it a shot if you guys have any questions about what he did comment below and I'll try and answer them but I think it was pretty self-explanatory you get obviously - ciao change that up and be kind of cool to like maybe throw some like pecans or some almonds or something in the chocolate that'd be a pretty cool thing to try other than that um yeah simple easy and enjoyable", "ifPFKH8SofA": "Is there anything better than the heavenly\nmix of chocolate and peanut butter in Reese's peanut butter cups? Whether you're craving something sweet or\nsalty, they always deliver. Let's take a look inside the history of this\nclassic American candy. \"What\u2019s he doing?\" \"He's got our peanut butter, and our chocolate.\" \"Sounds good.\" \"Reese's Peanut Butter cups.\" You might think that the culinary genius behind\nReese's is a lifelong candy-maker, but that's not the case at all. Harry Burnett, or H.B., Reese labored away\nat a long list of jobs before he ever came up with the idea of making candy. He was a factory worker, a farmer, and even\nthe manager of a fish hatchery, all before he became a dairy farmer employed by none\nother than Milton Hershey. Even then, the road to success wasn't a straight\none. Reese found himself needing to make some extra\ncash to support his growing family, and in 1919, he met a man at a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nmarket who gave him a recipe and asked him to make hard candies. It didn't work, though, as the candies stuck\ntogether. So it was back to the drawing board. Reese tried making a candy bar named after\nhis daughter as well as a coconut caramel bar, and then he finally started making candies\nwith various centers covered in chocolate. Originally, the chocolates came in assorted\nboxes, and the centers included cherries, dates, coconut, and, of course, peanuts. That last one was the foundation of a great\nidea. \"I love peanut butter, but I never tried it\nwith chocolate.\" H.B. Reese always used fresh ingredients for\nthe centers of his candies and Hershey's chocolate to go along with them. In 1917, he started working on one of Hershey's\ndairy farms before he eventually made the jump to the chocolate factory. He was still working for the company when\nhe decided to strike out on his own. He quit his job in 1923, but first, he went\nto Milton Hershey and asked for his permission to set up his own candy company. Hershey allowed that, under the stipulation\nthat all of Reese's chocolate had to come from the Hershey company. He agreed, and five years later, a simple\nsuggestion would change the course of the company. A shop owner whom Reese was visiting on a\nsales call asked him if he could make something that was peanut butter on the inside and chocolate\non the outside. Obviously, he said that he could, and it would\ngo on to become the company's flagship product. In 1963, Hershey purchased Reese's, seven\nyears after Reese died of a heart attack. This development wasn't terribly surprising,\nas Milton Hershey always had some peanut butter cups in his desk. The two longtime friends and collaborators\nremained close even after the end of their lives, as they were laid to rest just meters\napart in Hershey cemetery. It's easy to forget that luxuries like air\nconditioning haven't been around forever. And when you're working with chocolate, heat\ncan cause some serious problems, and it absolutely did for Harry Burnett Reese. Throughout the 1930s, his company was faced\nwith a huge problem. In the summer months, it was just too hot\nto make chocolate candies. Everything would simply melt, and this was\nwell before there was a quick and affordable solution to counteract that. Chocolate was thus off the table, quite literally. \"My chocolate, my beautiful chocolate!\" \"Don't just stand there, do something!\" \"Help. Police.\" But if the company wanted to remain afloat,\nit needed to keep employees busy and pay the bills. To find a solution, Reese turned to a completely\ndifferent industry to keep the lights on: canning. Employees would can beans and tomatoes when\nthey couldn't make chocolate. They did everything by hand, from prepping\nthe vegetables to putting the labels on the cans. Who would've thought that we have tomatoes\nto thank for keeping Reese's around? Reese's started out making all sorts of candy,\nbut nowadays they focus squarely on peanut butter cups and associated products like Reese's\nPieces. Part of the reason is the simple fact the\ncups were an outstanding success. Family lore says that when H.B. Reese was\nfirst trying to figure out how to make his peanut butter cups, he roasted his peanuts\nuntil they were on the verge of burning. That's what still gives Reese's peanut butter\nthat distinctive, unmistakable taste. Times were tough during the lean years of\nthe Great Depression, but sales were strong, and so Reese was able to weather the worst\nof it. But then came World War II and with it, food\nrationing. Sugar was on the top of the list of ingredients\nthat were suddenly in limited supply, and even though Hershey shared some of his stock\nwith Reese, it wasn't enough for him to keep up with demand. Some of his candies simply had to go, and\nin the end, he kept only the peanut butter cup. It was a practical decision that ended up\nbeing a very good one, since the peanut butter cups required the least amount of sugar to\nmake. Ad campaigns can make or break a product,\nand in the case of Reese's, their biggest ones definitely helped raise their profile. You might think that a well-established brand\nwould want to market its longevity, but Reese's actually did the opposite. In the 70s, the company launched a major campaign\nby pretending that the candy was something new and that most people didn't even like\nthe idea of chocolate and peanut butter together. How it all came together was a little strange. Chocolate-covered peanut butter candies had\nbeen sold as early as 1907 and when Hershey bought Reese's in 1963, the peanut butter\ncups were a huge hit. In fact, by 1969, they were Hershey's best-selling\ncandy. Despite all that, when the peanut butter cups\ngot their very first national ad campaign, they were marketed like a brand new idea that\nmight seem gross, but was actually delicious. The premise was simple. The commercials showed two people, one eating\nchocolate and one eating peanut butter. They would then collide into each other and\nsay: \"You got peanut butter on my chocolate!\" \"Well, you got chocolate in my peanut butter! BRAVISIMO!\" After the initial shock, the chocolate and\npeanut butter eaters would then realize the amazing combination they had stumbled upon. You might be wondering: why act like an already-popular\nproduct is something new that people had to be convinced to try? Hershey wanted to firmly cement the relationship\nbetween Reese's and Hershey in the public's mind. Rebranding made people associate the candy\nwith something the Hershey company had created, and thus, they got all the credit. \"Delicious!\" \"Two great tastes that taste great together! Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Real milk chocolate.\" In the 1970s, Hershey launched a new product\nthat was originally called PBs. These candy-coated peanut butter bits were\neventually renamed Reese's Pieces, and you'd think that the name \"Reese's\" would have been\nenough to make them a major hit. At first, they kind of were. They had a successful launch, but it wasn't\nlong before sales started tapering off. That's not something any company wants to\nsee. But an opportunity presented itself when Universal\nStudios came along. The studio had an upcoming movie called E.T.,\nand they wanted to let Hershey know that Reese's Pieces were going to be in the movie. Unsurprisingly, the candy company jumped at\nthe chance to help promote the film. Hershey took a gamble and agreed to give Universal\nabout one million dollars worth of marketing for E.T. without even seeing a script. \"E.T. Home Phone.\" In hindsight, it's clear how smart a deal\nthat was, but at the time, there was no guarantee that that hefty wad of cash would be a solid\ninvestment. Ultimately, though, it paid off. Sales of Reese's Pieces skyrocketed, but it\ncould've gone very differently. The team behind E.T. originally planned to\nuse M&Ms, but when the Mars Company declined the offer... ...that paved the way for Reese's. Chocolate is great and all, but it's Reese's\nunique peanut butter that really makes its candy amazing. If you're a big peanut butter junkie, you\nshould know that not all Reese's are created equal. And fortunately for you, someone's done the\nmath so that you know just what you should splurge on. A Reddit user who goes by the name \"Rustid\"\ntook a handful of various Reese's candies, scraped out the peanut butter, and weighed\nit all to come up with a definitive chocolate-to-peanut butter ratio rating. The findings might just surprise you. The Reese's Small Heart contains the least\namount of peanut butter with just around 19 percent. Minis also come in pretty low, as they're\naround 28 percent peanut butter. \"Where is it? Where is the rest?\" On the flip side, the Reese's Egg and Heart\nhave a much more generous share of about 60 percent peanut butter. The Pumpkin and the King Size come in just\nbelow that with a touch over 50 percent peanut butter. So all you peanut butter lovers out there\nshould keep it in mind that Valentine's Day and Easter are the best times to stock up\non your stash for the year. Halloween is a great time of year, but it\ntypically comes with a certain amount of disappointment. \"I got a chocolate bar!\" \"I got a quarter!\" \"I got a rock.\" There's always candy left in the bag that\nnobody on the block actually wants. But Reese's doesn't have to worry about that,\nand in 2018, the company came up with a pretty awesome way to demonstrate its superiority. This was achieved by taking to the streets\nof New York City with a giant orange machine. The idea was simple: people would drop in\ntheir unwanted Halloween candy and get peanut butter cups in return. The machine was ready, willing, and able to\ngive out around 10,000 peanut butter cups in just the five hours it was out and about,\nand it was a massive hit. Sadly, though, it seems as though that debut\nwas its one and only appearance, although Hershey spokespeople hinted that they might\ndeliver the Reese's Candy Exchange to other cities in the future. Maybe if we all ask nicely, it'll end up going\non a national tour soon enough. \"What did you think about the machine? Did you like it?\" \"Yeah, I've never seen anything like that.\" Nobody's perfect, and sometimes things slip\nthrough the cracks. That's even happened with something as awesome\nas Reese's, but there's a valuable lesson to be learned here. If you ever happen to get a Reese's without\nthe peanut butter, you should reach out to the company via social media. In 2018, an Iowa man named Alex Hentges headed\nover to Reese's Facebook page to post about his peanut butter-less peanut butter cup and\nask what the heck was going on. \"Have you ever heard the term 'the customer\nis always right'?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah, well, here I am.\" The company responded, at first telling him\nthat they were going to be sending him some coupons to replace his defective Reese's. But when the mail arrived a few days later,\nthe delivery was something much more substantial, as Hentges was sent a letter of apology and\na massive box containing about 5 pounds' worth of various Reese's candy. A Reese's spokesperson told Today Food, \"We're still not sure how exactly the peanut\nbutter vanished, but everyone knows it can't be a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup without the\npeanut butter, so the brand had to make things right!\" Now that's just great customer service. Reese's mix of chocolate and peanut butter\nis nothing short of magical, and it turns out that there's a scientific principle behind\nit. It's something called \"dynamic sensory contrast.\" Taste buds essentially love it when you eat\nsomething with contrasting textures, like the smoothness of the chocolate and the slightly\ncrunchy peanut butter. When you couple that with another contrasting\ncombination, like the sweetness of the chocolate and the saltiness of the peanut butter, then\nyou've got a winning team that no one can resist. \"It\u2019s science.\" This principle is also called the \"ice cream\neffect,\" and it's why there's always room for ice cream even after the biggest of dinners. \"What do you think?\" \"It's wonderful! You should be very proud!\" \"Thank you very much.\" There's a catch, though, as these contrasting\nflavors and textures are so good that it can make you forget how much you're eating. So if you've ever powered your way through\nhalf a bag of Minis without realizing it, you can say that it wasn't because you're\na glutton, it's just science! Essentially, these contrasting flavors can\ntaste so good that it overrides our sense of feeling full. \"What do you think? You love it! She loves it!\" \"Really good.\" Check out one of our newest videos right here! Plus, even more Mashed videos about your favorite\nstuff are coming soon.

you need you're going to need powdered sugar one and a half tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature some candy melts you can use any kind you want I'm using dark cocoa here you can get these at any craft store you'll also need three fourths cup of creamy peanut butter you could use crunchy if you want you're going to use our excuse me need some decorator brushes these are Wilton's I got these at michael's craft store you'll need some candy molds if you can tell these are kind of cup shaped a small saucepan and you're going to need a sifter to sift your your confectioner or powdered sugar in so this is what you do let's get started okay over low heat I just cut the little butter into little pieces and put it in this pan here or this this little saucepan and I put my peanut butter in and you want to do it on low heat and you want to mount this and melt it completely and when we get to that stage we want to incorporate our sifted sugar here or our powdered sugar so when we get to that stage I will show you what to do next in the meantime for your candy melts what you need to do is you can either melt them in a bowl and just follow your package directions on the back or you can use okay where are they you can use these which you can get it at any craft store also these are disposable decorating bags you can actually melt them in that so when we get to the stage where we're going to mount the can d and get to that stage I'll show you what to do okay my peanut butter and butter they're all melted together it's all melted as you can see and this is I actually sifted about a cup of the confectioner sugar because I may need a little bit more so what I'm going to do is just put the peanut butter in the confectioner sugar and we're going to mix this all together until you form a dough make sure you get all that see there's like a little bit room it's in I mean you know get all of it out i watch cooking shows when I can and notice that the chef's another you know crunched for time and whatnot but they don't ever scrape the bold and it just really drives me insane don't know why but anyways I digress make sure that you're in the shot and you are and you're just going to keep mixing this and mixing this in mixing this until all the sugar and peanut butter are incorporated together and it's going to be probably like a stiff dough you can actually incidentally sprinkle just a tad little bit of cocoa sifted maybe I don't know maybe a teaspoon or so in there you don't want to color the dough really but you want to give it a little bit of a flavor that's actually your favorite peanut butter cup recipe the peanut butter has a little bit of chocolate in it did you know that because if you don't you do now so this is just about incorporated next thing you want to do when you see that it all is is you're going to get some plastic wrap this is all done and it should be like play dough consistency you're going to get some plastic wrap as I said I never can tear this stuff and we're going to put this in the plastic wrap and you're going to put it in the refrigerator for about an hour until it's completely chilled and we'll be back in an hour okay i melted the chocolate in the decorator bag and i snipped the end off but i need a snip a little bit more off because it's just with chocolate is so thick that it doesn't want to come out and you want you don't want to put half in you definitely want to put some some chocolate in each one and i'll show you here in just a second what we need the brush for the little paintbrush for i showed you be careful not to burn yourself this chocolate is very very hot so if you have little ones helping you don't let them squeeze the chocolate i'm telling you now it is it's gonna burn the role hand so alright so i put see a sikh you can see you where are ya can you see it's a little bit less well it's about a third maybe a third of the chocolate in there and shake it all right now with your brush here what you're going to do is you're going to paint the chocolate up the sides paint the chocolates up the sides make sure you get all of it like all the sides I mean not all of the chocolate and you're going to do this for each mold I'm going to spare you so you don't have to watch me do this because you know you'd be watching me forever just paint them up the sides like that and when you're done with painting them up the sides give them a little tippy tap now you may you may think well well the bottom doesn't look that even after I did that will squirt some more chocolate in there after you paint the sides and doing a little tippy tap like I showed you then you're going to put them in the refrigerator and you're going to let them stay for at least 30 minutes before you take them out and they should be done about the same time if you put them in the 30 minute mark as your peanut butter so when we get to that point I will be back and I'll show you how to put the peanut butter filling in okay so I have taken my any chocolate molds out of the refrigerator and I also took my peanut butter dough if you will out of the refrigerator also and you can see that i put a tiny amount in each one I just patted it down and make sure this isn't a shot okay just take some peanut butter put it in the middle and you just take your finger and you just Pat it down like that okay now you take it just do this one one more time you don't need a whole big big huge amount about I don't know this much you can tie a judge it's fairly easy to do and you just Pat it down with your finger okay and then make sure these are all good you tried it down the next thing we'll do so i had to reno my chocolate from the bag because you know sitting out it's going to get it's going to get hard again so you just when you're done just squeeze some more chocolate on the top of each one and don't worry if you think well I don't know if this is enough chocolate because when you tap your mold down the chocolate is going to settle so don't even worry about it so we're just filling each mold okay some of these look kind of sparse down like that one all right this is all you do you just tap it this this is the worst noise you see how this is kind of overflowed don't worry about that because when you pop them out of the mold you can take a little paring knife and fix that so I already see that I'm going to need a little bit more chocolate in some of these because the peanut butter is peaking so I'm just going to fill that in that one needs a little bit more alright and we're going to stick these back in the refrigerator okay to harden up a little bit this this is want to get it to the top of the mold some of these are just over the top and some other or not hey anyways but you want to put these back in the refrigerator just until they harden probably another 30-45 minutes and when they are finished and they're ready to pop out of the molds I will show you what they look like okay these are done and I just wanted to show you this one well excuse me see how it came out little ridges and I'm going to cut it in half for you so you can see what it looks like just to tie it on tiny more here you have your very own peanut butter cups and they are amazing so I hope you try this out and until next time take care you", "N37R0pFG2YY": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to Big John TV today we're doing John's absolute favorite cookie involves these Reese's peanut butter cups so John's favorite cookie is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cookies simple enough right basically a base of peanut butter cookie and when they come out of the oven we're gonna pop in a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so come along and take a look I'll show you what goes into them okay this recipe starts out as a simple peanut butter cookie we've got 1 and 3/4 cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking soda we'll mix this together and set it aside those are our dry ingredients next we move on to our wet ingredients we have half a cup of butter that's one stick of softened butter to that we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of peanut butter this is a debate in our house I prefer creamy peanut butter okay Chumley's chunky but I'm making the cookies so I get creamy so that we add half a cup of white sugar half a cup of brown sugar and we're going to beat this together until it's light and fluffy okay you can see the color on this has changed it's nice and light and fluffy to this we're going to add one beaten egg 2 tablespoons of milk 1 teaspoon of vanilla now we're gonna blend that all together again alright that looks well incorporated next we're gonna add in our flour mixture I like to add about half at a time mix it together start out slow or you'll have flour everywhere [Applause] alright there's our cookie dough the next step is we're gonna roll this out into 40 balls and it will be placed into our mini muffin pan we're gonna go ahead and give this mini muffin pan a little spray with some nonstick cooking spray I've got the coconut oil spray here and I like to do that over the sink to not create much of a mess our oven has been preheating to 375 and you want to make them about the size of a large jawbreaker maybe not too big because we're trying to get 40 cookies out of this mix I'd say it's maybe a tablespoon of mixture tablespoon of dough per cookie which doesn't seem like a lot but you have to remember you're gonna stick a candy piece in the middle alright this is the last cookie here I'm gonna go ahead and stop there for now and show you the next step this dough also freezes really well wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and it'll hold in the freezer for like three months at least so these cookies will go in the oven at 375 for about eight minutes when they come out is when we will add these do not add your chocolate before they go in the oven it will not work right alright my cookies are out of the oven they're in they're just about eight minutes you can see they've got a nice golden color around the edges and they puffed up quite a bit filled in the whole little mini cups there as they come out we're gonna pop these little chocolates in I think John likes this part huh you like pushing them down in young come help very satisfying squash don't touch the pan yeah the pan is super hot still you got to do this quick before the cookie set otherwise they won't sink down and in and don't be afraid to really push him in there you want it pushed in the level of the kitchen and you can't hesitate either because then they start to melt right away put him in there shove it in tie one extra and that's it once these cool down a little more you can easily pop them out of the pan put them on a platter and serve them well let these cool a little bit and we'll show you what they look like out of the pan and probably taste test one for you too [Music] all right they're done so you know I've shown up there nice and warm still these are good warm or cooled off completely well yeah you got to let it warm a little bit because of their see how that wants to drip already so you gotta let them cool down just

am Jeff and today we are looking at the Reese peanut butter cup that's right a true classic comes to the candy aisle you may know this also as Reese's Peanut Butter Cup sometimes there's an S on the packaging sometimes there's not it's just up to the localization and the form factor of the packaging but of course this is the classic chocolate and peanut butter from Reese's or Reese HB candy company subsidiary of Hershey of course the story goes that HB Reese he was a former dairy farmer and he was the shipping foreman for Hershey in Hershey Pennsylvania he worked for Milton Hershey I guess personally and and he decided he was so inspired by working with Hershey that he decided to form his own candy company out of his basement and his focus he used the Hershey chocolate he was he lived in Hershey Pennsylvania and he used Hershey's chocolate to create a line of chocolate products this Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was his grand success most popular chocolate originally created in 1928 and eventually he ended up stopping producing stopping producing any of his other kinds of chocolate and and just focused on the Reese and sort of Reese like peanut butter cup affiliated sort of family products after he died in the 63 the Reese company was sold to Hershey's they obviously had a had a very close relationship anyway providing the chocolate for them so it sort of made sense to bring it into into the Hershey Company although of course the reefs and the Reese's name is still kept on the branding I'm just going to say Reese because it gets too confusing to say Reese lash Reese's some products say Reese some products say Reese's it's not reseed people it drives me nuts when people say that though anyway this is the Canadian package of it which is why it's in a three pack you might not see that in other parts of the world but this really comes in different packaging configurations all over the place the cups themselves are different sizes they have different sizes of the of the cups they have oh my god I was looking at internet before for this video and there are over 20 different varieties of just just the cups just like different like the crunchy the smooth the you know extra chocolate the you know the fudge flavoring there's fudge yeah fudge for reals I'd like to see that anyway um it smells so good there there are a lot of different rescan figurations for these peanut butter cups and and that's okay these guys were the first the brightest and boldest and paved the way for all knockoff peanut butter cups to come in the future this is the peanut butter cup itself as you can see from that pitcher there that's what it will look like on the inside they come in these neat little wrappers like a little cupcake like a little delicious cupcake of chocolate joy chocolate and peanut butter now you guys old enough to remember the old tagline you got your peanut hey you got your peanut butter in my chocolate hey you got your chocolate in my peanut butter that's what happened in the ad people would run into each other and oh we got it mixed up and then they'd have a taste of it and say two great tastes that taste great together this is delicious get that out of here a little melty that's okay smells so good you know I've said many a time on walking the candy I love it chocolate and caramels all you need I also feel like seriously chocolate peanut butter pretty amazing let's give this a try I know our my overseas and UK viewers might not be so into this because you know peanut butter isn't regarded as highly there but man oh man if you like peanut butter this is something you know you got a try there's the inside of the peanut butter cup whoo it is getting melty you can see it right there though mmm delish I don't know what it is because I mean the peanut butter is obviously it's more sugary than you get if you you know store-bought peanut butter but it's not so sugary that it turns you off you know like some people like I found them if you want to check out my review for Russell Stover's peanut butter egg that I did at Easter last year you can see that you can see that it doesn't always work when you can just try and add extra sugar but that's so pleasing those little lines there but just peanut butter is just the perfect kind of consistency the perfect level of sweetness and it pairs so well with the chocolate you know what the other tag line was for Reese's there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's yep no wrong way to eat one of these peanut butter cups oh so messy sorry guys but man oh man these things are great there's just a near-perfect pairing of chocolate and peanut butter interestingly and I don't know really what the deal is with Hershey and their decisions on gradings of chocolate it's the Hershey Company you'd think that they put the best chocolate in there Hershey products you know Hershey branded products but um but no I mean clearly no because I have you know across the board always felt like the Reese chocolate is of a higher quality than Hershey so if for some reason you haven't had a Reese peanut butter cup even if you are not a huge peanut butter fan I really recommend it I think that it's a great combination it's a great flavor and it's just a good really good like level of meshing peanut butter from chocolate this peanut butter has a little bit of a smoothness to it but it's not like buttery smooth it's just good peanut flavor and it's good chocolate so I enjoy it I'm going to recommend Rees peanut butter cups definitely worth checking out please go have some if you haven't walking the candy aisle is going to rate these I'm going to give them a very very solid 4 out of 5 it's almost a 5 almost I don't know I don't know what's keeping it back for me but it's a 4 anyway thanks for watching if you liked this review please check click on the links that you see on the screen here all that good stuff like subscribe you know follow us all that stuff thanks for watching everyone and I will see you next time later", "4HIPWHGh5g8": "hey I'm Fucci and welcome to tiny kitchen big tastes we're in the middle of quito month here in the TK we're all month long we were making some really great really tasty keep delicious recipes today we've got an exciting show for you we're making Quito peanut butter eggs Easter is coming and the good old Easter Bunny is bringing us the ultimate Quito treat a little chocolate a little peanut butter ultimate perfection so let's get hopping because it's time to bring it [Music] Kido Kido so what you're gonna need is creamy peanut butter coconut flour monk fruit sweetener vanilla and your favorite keto chocolate you'll also need a couple of mixing bowls a baking sheet in silicone baking mat a cooling rack a ziplock bag which is optional measuring cups and measuring spoons a spoon and a sharp knife who doesn't love a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I think it's pretty safe to say that most everybody does unfortunately when you're on the keto diet you just can't have them wha-wha unfortunately they are loaded with sugar so got me thinking what if we were to take out those carbs replace them with fats and proteins switch a few things around add a few things take a few things out and boom we would have the perfect keto treat and since it's Easter we could make them into Easter eggs so let's get started by pour in our peanut butter into our mixing bowl now I'm using smooth peanut butter that's best for this recipe if you like the little extra crunch you could always use that though do that we're gonna add some coconut flour this is a great alternative to regular flour because it's a little bit higher in fat lower in carbs next we're gonna add our monk fruit sweetener which is our substitute for the regular sugar and just a touch of vanilla we'll mix this up until it's thoroughly combined as you can see it's all come together into this nice thick dough if you find that it's too thin you can add a little bit more coconut flour or if it's too thick by all means just add a little bit more peanut butter next we're gonna pinch off just about an ounce of the peanut butter batter that's about I'm at an inch and a half in diameter a little bit smaller than a ping pong ball well place that on our baking sheet and then we're just gonna form it into the shape of an Easter Egg so check that out haha we're gonna pop these in our freezer for about 30 minutes or until they're frozen solid so while our peanut butter is freezing we can prepare our chocolate for melting now this is kedo chocolate but chocolate naturally has carbohydrates in it so although you can have it on a keto diet it's not one of those things that you want to overindulge on so I'm just gonna break these into smaller pieces and then to make it easier to melt I'm gonna chop it up a little bit more with our nice then we'll transfer all of this to our mixing bowl I'm gonna pop this in the microwave on HIGH power checking and stirring every 15 seconds until it's nice and smooth all right it actually melts pretty quickly look at that perfect we can take out our peanut butter eggs out of the freezer and then we'll just remove it from our baking sheet and place it in our chocolate make sure it's thoroughly coated and then I'm gonna place it right on our cooling rack and we'll go back in for number two now the peanut butter is cold so the chocolate might start to firm up a little bit if you've got to pop it back in the microwave no problem I'm gonna finish up the rest of these and we'll be right back so we've got a little bit of chocolate left I'm just gonna scoop that up and transfer it to our zip lock bag now the chocolates already started to firm up at this point we can just snip the tip of the bag and then we can just run it back and forth over the egg creating a nice little fancy pattern so we've got our fancy little drizzle on top we can just let them Harden at this point or we can pop them in the freezer if we want to make that happen a little faster and then we'll plate them up so check these out just in time for Easter hey go get the recipe for these they're available on our website you can also check us out at Facebook Instagram and Pinterest and when you try this recipe please let us know about it in the comments below and don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell until next time i'm Fucci reminding you that if I can make keto peanut butter eggs and a kitchen this tiny you can make it in yours we'll see you next time on tiny kitchen big tastes have you sir I got you we're making some really great really tasty tea delicious resident who doesn't love a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cup Cup [Music]", "fecYMKNmmbQ": "hey guys today me and you're gonna be trying two products from coco therapy two types of products i have peanut butter cups and some blueberries uh i have milk dark chocolate almond butter cups milk chocolate peanut butter cups dark chocolate peanut butter cups and uh dark chocolate covered blueberries that's wonderful um these were we bought these at marshall they were 3.99 per bag i mean they're made in california if you care so we're gonna try the almond butter the dark chocolate almond butter first [Applause] they're individually wrapped which is always nice do we go in half it appears that they would be all illegal uh it appears it would be resealable but it's not no not a reasonable but it's individual you know what it doesn't matter see if mom had actually done this bag she'd been right for once there's all the inside not bad i actually like the flavor of that it's really mostly dark chocolate yeah man it's supposed to be no that was going to help look at the wrong one that's like there's no way this is milk chocolate no not even a chance yeah but it's good chocolate i like it i don't really eat the almond butter much but i do get i like the dark chocolate that's probably 70 60 or 70 percent yeah it's not real bitter it's it you can tell it's dark and it kind of dries your mouth out but i don't get any of the almond butter at all because that dark chocolate is too strong yeah just too strong one piece is 80 calories um when you see the picture you will you'll note that there's not a lot of peanut butter filling in this it's a lot of dark chocolate so yeah so the almond butter you'd have to take small bites to even try to get because i ate the whole thing of course because it's a bite size it's pretty small and um [Applause] there's a there's a lot of dark chocolate there yeah but it's good dark chocolate i like it i think the the almond butter more sweetens it up than anything so these are 90 calories so a little bit more for you individually wrapped in these packages they're not like a reese's cup they don't have that little paper is a lot lighter cut to it i'll two bite this one oh that's that's a lot more peanut butter in there though it's not a like a racy cub no um sweetness that's what's missing is the sweetness it's just way more milk chocolate than a peanut taste peanut it is it's more peanutty than peanut butter it's not bad but it doesn't even compete with a reese's cup only nowhere near it when you buy these and you're expecting a reese's cup type flavor you're not going to get anywhere you're going to be very disappointed they seem healthier they seem like a healthy version of a reese's cup which now makes me wonder what the calorie count count is on one recent cup i don't know i'm sure i would say probably 110. per one maybe i'd say 220. block me didn't it hey this is a dark chocolate this is going to be exactly the same as the version we're not going to get the peanut butter maybe the peanut butter will feel stronger how many dollars is that this is 80 so we're back back to 80. [Applause] same color chocolate as the first one the thicker no not as thin as the other one reese's cup is 105 perfect per cup so for what the extra 15 calories greasy cup all the way a beer these are what four dollars a bag so you can get for 2.99 i don't know how i know that you can get a pack of the individual cups starring i actually like that too uh whoever you are i like the dark chocolate peanut butter cup better than i like the dark chocolate almond butter it has a little bit more peanut butter you can actually taste the inside yeah the actual peanut butter comes through a little bit more in there it doesn't sound bad again not quite a reese's cup because you can get a dark reese's cup now i think this is better do you think these would be individually wrapped no now this bag does have a resealable thing on it because it's not in a package yeah individual here's here's two blueberries in this package that's funky that is cool it's very chemical they're literally like little rabbit pellets i took from the first shot here oh yeah 150 calories for 30 grams okay let's lay that out how many swords are in the bag six that tells you how how much um those taste like they smell they're funky a little funky they taste a little funky they're like those i don't get the blueberry i don't get the dark chocolate or the blueberry it's just funk yeah it's really strange flavor this might as well be a sock yeah you're pulling out i think these for the price you would think they're more of a higher end product and then really the flavor just doesn't match the price so yeah so anyway hope you enjoyed this video thanks for watching [Music] you [Music] you", "3UpjjaUGHWY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

some simple peanut butter cups to make your peanut butter cups first combine a half cup peanut butter along with a half cup of powdered sugar 2 tablespoons room-temperature butter and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt just mix this lightly and put it in the microwave just until it's nice and smooth about a minute minute and a half next you're going to melt your chocolate you need nine ounces of milk chocolate and also nine ounces of semi-sweet chocolate you're also going to need one tablespoon of vegetable shortening microwave this once again thirty-second increments just until it's nice and smooth you can make these any size you want I went for mini cupcakes size so I just lined my cupcake pan with rappers next you're just going to use about a teaspoon of the chocolate put that in the bottom of the cup and then about a half teaspoon of the peanut butter mix top it with some more chocolate and then you just need to put those in the refrigerator to harden I hope you love the peanut butter cups it's one of my favorite treats to make if you have a special treat that you love to make share it with me in the comments", "MInaoy3XIjs": "hey my lovelies if you've got a sweet tooth that needs to be satisfied you have come to the right place today because I am sharing five incredible dessert recipes they're all made with four ingredients or less how amazing is that the best part about these amazing desserts is that while they taste really decadent they actually are all on the healthier side so I like to think of them as desserts you can feel good about first up today I've got an incredibly rich brownie this is actually a no-bake brownie and it all starts in your food processor I'm getting started with a whole lot of walnuts in my food processor the walnuts in this case are going to ask a little bit like our flour so they're going to be the bulk of our brownies so you want to give them a head start a couple good pulses you don't want to lose all their texture but you want to make sure that they're not big chunks anymore next we are going to add our glue and buy glue I mean dates which have such a gluey texture these are pitted dates of course you don't want to leave those pits in you will ruin your food processor real quick I'm also going to add a good helping of cocoa powder here because of course these are brownies after all I'm just going to blend all of this awesomeness together until it creates a nice sticky dough then I'm just going to press this mixture into a well greased baking dish and set it aside while I get to melting some chocolate I'm starting with a small saucepan on my stove it's got about an inch of water simmering on the bottom and I'm just going to top that with a glass bowl that is full of chopped dark chocolate I'm going to keep stirring my chocolate until it's completely melted and then I am going to pour it over my brownies oh yeah people once that chocolate has been spread evenly over the top of my brownies I'm going to get this entire dish into the refrigerator for between 30 minutes and an hour once they're set you can cut them into pieces as small or as large as you like and then they are ready to be enjoyed I think that they are best consumed with a nice tall glass of milk next step guys I've got some really incredible peanut butter cookies also made which is four amazing ingredients of course any peanut butter cookie has to start with the peanut butter so into the bullet goes to add a little fiber to these cookies I'm going to be dumping in some old-fashioned oats and then I'm going to add my coconut sugar you definitely have the option to either use brown sugar or traditional granulated sugar in this recipe both will work just as well and then I'm also going to add one egg I'm going to mix that all together until it's well combined and then simply spoon these onto a parchment lined baking sheet now you may remember this technique from your grandma's baking I definitely do when you're making peanut butter cookies you've got to use your fork and you basically put a little grid pattern in the top of them I don't know why we do this with peanut butter cookies but I know that my grandmother would not approve any other way and then I'm just going to get them into the oven at 350 degrees for between 8 and 10 minutes when they come out they are nice and soft and chewy if you prefer a crispy cookie not to worry you can leave them in the oven a little longer and they will crisp up it's so great to make a big batch of these on Sunday during your meal prep and then you have a sweet treat to enjoy all week long our next amazing dessert actually only involves three delicious ingredients and could honestly not be simpler to make we are baking up some apples in this case but you could also do this with some peaches if you wanted to or some pears in the fall baked pears are my favorite I'm going to cut my apples in half but I'm also just going to cut a little slice off the side of each of my apples this is going to help them sit flat in my baking dish please you can just enjoy yourself we're just gonna remove the seeds and the core from our apples like so I'm using an ice cream scoop but if you have an apple corer that works just as well and then I'm just going to arrange these in a well greased baking dish top them with some maple syrup and some cinnamon and get them into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 25 and 30 minutes you'll know they're done because the Apple will be super soft and falling apart I think that these are mind-blowing when serves with some vanilla flavored yogurt and some granola for crunch for breakfast actually dessert for breakfast I like the spirit of that next for another slightly more decadent offering I've got some homemade peanut butter cups people oh yeah you're going to want to stay tuned for these now you guys are probably already well aware that peanut butter and chocolate are two of my very favorite flavors my favorite in fact I had a hard time keeping a straight face for that one but I managed we got through it to make these yummy peanut butter cups we're actually going to get started by preparing the center's first so I've got some natural peanut butter hanging out in a bowl into that I'm going to add a couple tablespoons of agave syrup now you actually do have the option to skip this step if you want to leave your peanut butter unsweetened you can totally go ahead and do that next we are going to stir this all together and then just spoon it into little discs onto a parchment lined baking sheet we're going to pop our peanut butter discs into the freezer and let them set for between 30 minutes and an hour because of the fat in that peanut butter they do take a while to set but honestly the best things in life come to those who wait once your peanut butter is set you can get to work on preparing your chocolate once again I'm using a double boiler on the stove to melt my chocolate once my chocolates melted I'm just going to stir in a few tablespoons of coconut oil and then it is time to get our peanut butter cups happening the idea here is to place about a tablespoon of chocolate in to the bottom of each cupcake liner now I prefer using the liners that are actually made with parchment paper as I find they are emotional and stick option but of course any cupcake liners will do then I'm going to pop these into the freezer for between five and ten minutes once our first layer of chocolate is set we can add our peanut butter to the center of each and then top each with the rest of our delicious melted chocolate now I know this is technically adding a fifth ingredient but I really think they are most delicious when you add a little sprinkling of sea salt on top you can pop these in the freezer for another thirty minutes or so until they're completely set and then they are ready to be enjoy salty sweet chocolate peanut buttery goodness that is worth each and every delicious calorie for my final dessert today I'm making a recipe that starts simply enough but by the end will get you really fired up there my flambe bananas and they are super good served with ice cream for this recipe of getting started with some slightly under ripe bananas because I want them to hold their shape during cooking I'm just going to slice them up and then get them into my skillet over medium-high heat with some melted coconut oil once your banana start to soften up it's time to add your sugar this is going to help them get nice and crispy and caramelize so it does not take long for your bananas to get real happy and that means it is time for our flambe it's really important to turn your hood vent and your stove off before you've blown Bay so we've got a barbecue later this is going to allow us to have a little bit of distance from the stand and we've got our coconut rum now obviously guys it is really really important that you use caution if you're using an open flame in the kitchen be sure that there is nothing around your skillet that could accidentally get caught in fire and of course keep a fire extinguisher at handy just in case of an accident what you're going to end up with are these beautiful caramelized bananas that are syrupy sweet and perfect served with some vanilla ice cream I hope you guys love these recipes as much as I do and that you'll give them a try in your very own kitchen if you do of course tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I love seeing your kitchen creation keep in mind the full recipes are in the description box below and of course if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more deliciousness where this came out", "2lYmPwqbmzA": "anabolic reese's peanut butter ice cream milkshake that's what we're making today it is incredible this has been about 20 times i have tested out this recipe to get it exactly how i wanted it and i think you guys will enjoy it too we're not using cereal on this one we're using a real reese's these are the thin version but we're still gonna get some of the real thing and we're even gonna get some of the regular peanut butter as well so far my other recipes have gotten nothing but great feedback i'm hoping this one will be the same and i kind of want to see which one you guys think is better remington's or mine remington seems super fluffy i did have his a couple times and i went completely on my own recipe and started from scratch to see what would work best and that's probably why it takes me so many times but that's how i think i actually perfect my own style of recipe as well so this one's not going to be as thick you will need to drink it within a certain amount of time but it's going to be delicious you will be able to have reese's in almost every bite and you will also get little dabs of peanut butter real peanut butter throughout the milkshake and it's going to be so good like every time i'm ready to record i'm just thinking how much you guys will like this let's not waste any more time let's make some ice cream and you know what time it is let's get into it we have our scale with our blender with a plate on it so it's easier to balance now we're going to start with our wet ingredients so first greek yogurt 170 grams non-fat aka zero percent and as i've said before if you're a gram or two off that is okay 164 168 170.1 beautiful that's the worst part of the day then we have our milk i got skim milk you can use cashew milk you can use almond milk you can use water you can do whatever you want but we need five ounces of it or 140 grams boom 141.1 that's okay still gonna work just fine now that's it for our wet ingredients now we go to our dry ingredients what i found luck doing is putting the stuff that thickens up first i'm gonna start with the guar gum you could use anthem gum too but we're doing three grams mine is a 0.1 scale that's why i like mine so i try to get three grams on the dot because with guar gum pretty much every decimal point counts because it really does make it thick if you overdo it just even a little bit too much just a little bit more yeah three grams square gum and the last one i used 4 grams why am i changing it well because the pb2 makes it thicker you don't need as much guar gum we were doing 20 grams of pb2 or pb fit or whatever which would be a serving and a quarter because it's 16 grams in a serving add them four grams we got a serving and a quarter 20 grams all right good there i like to make mine a little bit more real chocolatey so i'm gonna add cocoa this is pure cocoa if you eat the cocoa by itself it doesn't taste very good there's no sweetener in it nothing to make it taste good i would not recommend you uh just take a little bit of this cocoa and put in your mouth because you'll be majorly disappointed like i have been before but we're going to add five grams of cocoa to give it that real taste 16.4 beautiful now i'm adding creatine this is optional i'm doing this because this is the time of day that i eat my creatine is after my workout but you can eat creatine whenever you want morning noon night does not matter i use a bodybuilding brand protein you don't have to use bodybuilding brand protein you can use whatever you want i do love their products the chocolate isn't as good as the vanilla or the oatmeal cookie but it is still above average a good chocolate protein especially for the price that you get it at but we're using a scoop and a quarter of whatever protein you use so for me 34 grams is a scoop so i'm going to do about 8 to 9 grams over that which would be 42 or 43 grams 42.5 perfect right in the middle this is one of the ones where i do use salt i know iron musket says to put a little bit of salt it brings out the flavor i haven't thus far but when i was experimenting with this i did feel that the salt really helps with the reese's peanut butter cups and everything that's like a pinch literally if i put too much on my hand i'll just put like half of it in and dump the other half into the sink you really don't need much man i should have put this earlier because this will also thicken it up this has xanthan gum in it but we're gonna use about seven grams i have chocolate fudge you could use chocolate i think chocolate fudge is a tad bit better it's not so much better but anything i can do to make it better i will you can get that pretty much anywhere now because of the cocoa being not sweetened at all i do have to put a little bit more sucralose than i'm used to or the artificial sweetener so i'm putting nine grams in this is once again something i had to experiment with to make sure it was still sweet but not overly sweet but not also tasting kind of i don't know not so good i don't know how to describe it but nine grams beautiful all of our dry ingredients are in so now we just have to add the ice this time we are adding 480 grams of ice it's always different the anabolic mint oreo milkshake was different than the cinnamon toast crunch milkshake then is different than this milkshake i'll have the list of everything in the description as well as if you want to see any of the products that i use you can also look at that in the description as well check it out if you want to learn more all right so i zeroed this out and we're doing 480 grams now if it's 482 that's okay if it's 478 that's okay right around 480. see 486 i do want to take a little bit of help all right 482 i'll take it i'm gonna chop two reese's thins up while this is mixing i put them in the freezer so it's easier to chop them up and they don't get all melty and all that stuff and they hold well in the ice cream once they're in the ice cream pro tip just throw whatever two or four or six however many reese's thins that you want to use in the future so you can just grab them cut them up and add them to your milkshake also i'm going to add skippy peanut butter now we're having real peanut butter you don't have to add this you don't have to add the reese's thins it does add about 150 160 calories but it makes it that much better it's like you're having a real milkshake you won't be able to really tell a difference between this and a milkshake that you would get from an ice cream store eight to nine out of ten like it's very close i actually bought an oberweis pint to try and oberweise of course is better but it's really not by that much we're gonna add eight grams which is a fourth of a serving which is like 45 calories i'm gonna melt it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and we're gonna add it all in after we mix everything up i'll see you in exactly one minute okay bye all right we're back i didn't even get to chop up my reese's yet but this is another good tip if you're gonna use a plate like i use it you can actually use the plate to chop up your reese's on and throw it away afterwards makes it easy all right i'm gonna give this a good mix make sure you just get everything on the sides honestly the transformation from minute one to minute two of blending is pretty crazy it goes from like four cups all the way up to like seven but just try to get the chunks mixed up so you really don't have any ice chunks i've really tried to get it to where you could barely tell there's even ice in there it's where they're literally just like little slivers of ice it's already so good yes all right one more minute and we will have a finished product besides putting our mixins in feel like that's what culver's mixing sorry mix-ins garnishes whatever okay bye [Music] all right we're back ice cream is ready or milkshake is ready should i say the great thing about this melted peanut butter which you don't have to add but the great thing about it is it really helps actually break down some of these little tiny ice chunks so that once you sit down and you're ready to eat it's time to eat and everything's mixed in can't tell the difference oh my god all right you should be doing this with a spatula noticed all of you those are so damn good already but uh usually i don't waste any of that but we got a recipe to show you guys almost gonna drop the reese's thins on the counter but we're gonna add these in get them all in there i'm gonna add some of this peanut butter just a little bit because i want to spread it throughout so i'm gonna put about half of the eight grams in there and you would be surprised you're like eight grams nick that ain't well sounds like it's not but until you add it in there and you mix it up and then you get those bites of real peanut butter and reese's things you're gonna be like wow what a boost to this recipe it is thank you nick as long as you have the calories of course if you don't have the calories don't add the peanut butter don't add the reese's thins it's still a great recipe without it but i highly recommend it if you do have the extra 100 150 calories because you don't have to make nic sized milkshakes you can make half the milkshake and then have 300 calories and have reese's and have peanut butter and have everything that you want in your life it's a beautiful thing all right this is pretty mixed up here i'm gonna add the rest of this peanut butter and i never said this is like a super clean process so yeah you're gonna lick your finger yeah your hands are gonna get dirty yeah you're gonna have to wash your hands but if you're not washing your hands nowadays what really are you doing add the rest of your peanut butter we're gonna mix the rest of this up and i decided it was time to move on from 7-eleven plastic cups onto the big leagues and so i haven't drank beer in a while so what better use to use a pitcher than to have a god damn anabolic milkshake in it every time i eat it we're gonna go ahead and pour and i'm gonna show you guys a close-up of what this looks like when you're pouring it in this is beautiful just look how much you get you don't even need to eat this much but i'm showing you that for right around 600 calories here you can eat this whole thing your stomach right here about that big okay okay i'm stuffed after i eat this i don't have to say any words when i show you that like it's just so evident that this is what you should do even half of this will fill you up most people up i can eat a lot oh hell yeah like this is literally filled to the brim like if i spill this in any way it's gonna come right out god it's so beautiful thank you greg i haven't done my shout out yet and i should have already thank you greg for showing me how to make these protein ice creams because now i live a full life instead of a hungry life i don't eat this one all the time my cinnamon toast corn is only like 400 calories and i don't always put reese's and peanut butter in it because without it it's about 450 calories so you can do this however you want it's so easily modifiable that you can make it to your taste all right so you're like nick how many calories is in this picture i almost feel like this is back in grade school and they fill the thing up with like jelly beans and they're like how many jelly beans is in here whoever guesses it gets the full thing of jelly beans this is very similar it's like how many calories is really in this fat thing of a pitcher of a milkshake well i'm glad you asked because i'll tell you right now all right so we have 614 calories 16 grams of fat most of which comes from that quarter thing of peanut butter 49 grams of carbs and 72 grams of protein you can't beat it have half of it 306 calories 36 grams of protein and reese's and peanut butter and everything that's real not fake yes you have pb fit but once you mix it in and then you get chunks of real reese's and then you get little dabs of peanut butter that's real 100 percent been having it for about two and a half weeks have had it about 20 to 30 times trying to perfect it but i never got sick of it and i never was a huge reese's person you are going to love this if you try it and i ask you if you've had remingtons before and you've now had mine tell me which one is better i don't really care i'm just curious what people's tastes are and what people like so if you like remington's better that's fine i would just like to know what the reason is so i can modify some of my ice creams to make them better but i really enjoy this there's no cereal all real reese's all real peanut butter one thing is if you try to modify the pb2 you're going to mess with the thickness a lot i was trying to do 24 grams of the pb fit then 16 grams neither one was good i did 22 grams i did 18 grams i finally ended at 20 grams i was experimenting a lot with the pv fit because between that and the jello it makes it thicker and then it's like okay well now how much xanthan gum do i put in there if you're gonna mess with anything i would mess with like the sugar and all that other stuff or else you're gonna be playing okay now it's too thick now it's too thin i don't like it like this this is a perfect milkshake consistency if that's what you're looking for also if you use vanilla protein powder i'm sure it's fine you may need to add another scoop of cocoa into it i'm not 100 sure but i would think that you would to make it more chocolatey because 5 grams really isn't a lot of chocolate when it's only those 5 grams this was chocolate protein too so i would add more cocoa but you also might have to add more sugar because the cocoa like i said does not taste very good by itself you might have to add more sugar at the end of the day you're going to be able to make it make it how you like it let's eat get full feel good get shredded i'm going to come out with more protein ice creams i want to hear what you guys want because i'm trying to make what you guys would like and it's pumpkin spice season so there may or may not be a pumpkin spice anabolic ice cream on the way but until next time i will see you in that next one you", "M5JgeZMq-98": "is that from Bastrop calm and today I'm making a chocolate peanut butter cup fat bomb and unlike those other peanut butter cups that your kids probably eat these don't have sugar they are loaded with healthy fats and are very good for you so come on and let's go ahead and make a batch okay so what is a fat bomb it's basically I'll use the word treat although it's not really a treat but it is a very very small treat that is primarily made up of fat about 85% fat or more in this one little little snack that you might have I use them primarily for after a workout and I go for a run right after our muscle workout I'll build up a lot of hunger a couple hours later and I don't want to eat anything because in a few hours I'm going to have dinner I'll go ahead and have a fat bomb and what that does it keeps me safe eiated it keeps hunger at bay and also gives me a nice little boost of energy too that's the beauty of fat healthy fats I should say the other thing you want to keep in mind with the fat bomb is it's not a meal replacement that's really important you're not getting the nutrients that you need well fat the healthy fats are very good for you you're still not getting the types of vitamins and minerals and nutrients that you're getting when you eat meats eggs avocado or leafy greens so just keep that in mind you don't have to use them but if you want to use them that's fine just not as a meal replacement so given that this particular recipe is based off of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but it is not a peanut butter cup that's another thing it won't taste like one because it's not going to have all the sugar in it but it is going to have some wonderful fat so the ingredients I have in this puppy are I have extra virgin coconut oil one of my healthy fats I've also got some butter another wonderful Pat unsalted that's what part of it I also have peanut butter which is organic and chill peanut butter so there's absolutely no other ingredient in it other than the peanuts so keep that in mind if you you can also use almond butter if you prefer or macadamia nut butter but again make sure there's absolutely no sugar no salt no preservatives nothing in there but the actual nut itself I also have a hundred percent cocoa powder which is Baker's grade so it's completely on Sweden it's just straightforward cocoa powder and I'm using a sweetener I'm using for myself a teaspoon of swerve that I use it's up to you what you want to use if you use stevia in the little packets probably a packet will do for you it just depends but just keep that in mind is that each sweetener is different as far as the amount but I'm using a teaspoon of swerd for my ingredients now there's no baking involved awesome but there is some cooking for these because you have to melt the peanut butter and the fats together and then add in your chocolate powder and also the sweetener to get all this mix what you're going to do is when you make them after you melt everything together going to put them into a mold or if you have a mini muffin pan that'll work too you just want to probably grease it a little bit it's going to be a little bit harder to get out unless you've got muffin papers that's probably the best way to go I'm using a silicon mould which is great the others and so what happens is they just pop right out once they're cooled or frozen what I like to do though is I'll use the tray and I'll put this on when I put it in the freezer because otherwise if you're picking this up and you've got your liquid in here is just going to be a mess so you don't want to do that so I'm going to put this aside we're going to go to the stovetop and cook this but I want it to give you a little tip if you have one of these Pyrex or this one's an anchor type of cup this is a 2 cup container that can go into a microwave you can make this in your microwave rather than a stovetop you just put your fast in first then your peanut butter then your cocoa powder and in your sweetener on top you put it in your microwave on HIGH and you do about 20 to 30 second intervals you want to make sure you don't get it boiling out of the top I've done that before by mistake won't ever do that again I can't do it again I don't have my - yeah but you do yeah maybe a four or five times and you just mix it as you're going along and that's the best way to melt it together you've got it already in here you just pour it into your little moles that way so with that I'm going to go ahead and go to the stove and I'm going to start this I'm going okay I've got my pan I have it already on a low medium setting if you will so the lowest setting for my meeting for medium and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and add the facts which is my butter and my coconut oil and I'm just going to melt them and I because I'm using stainless steel here I'm just sort of melting them first together before I start adding the peanut butter okay I'm going to go ahead and add the peanut butter the one thing when you're using 100% peanut butter there's nothing in there it is stickier I find go ahead and add my cocoa powder and my sweetener now what I'm doing to help break apart the cocoa powder and to make sure everything is really mixed together I got out my little whisk and I'm whisking everything together and now I'm going to do is on a port into my little cup oh it sounds really good but I'm going to pour it into here so I can pour this into my moulds a lot easier okay as you see I'm filling up the mold with the mixture and I try not to go all the way to the top and I keep a little paper towel just in case handy because it does spill the the recipe caught makes about 2024 the mold is loved it is larger than that so that's not that big of a deal but there we go I just want to pause there because I want to make sure I get everything in and not on top of the mold but anyway what you're going to do is once you fill these in put all your mixture inside the molds you're going to put this in the freezer for about 20 minutes maybe thirty minutes depends on how hot your mixture is and then after that the fat bombs are pretty much ready what I do is I do I keep them in the freezer primarily because the coconut oil and butter will soften if they're in the fridge or you certainly can't leave them out but some people may put them in the fridge I find that it gets them a little bit too soft they start sticking together so I like to keep them in the freezer all right I got my molds all filled up actually got a little bit more than 24 out of it this mold holds 30 and so I got 29 boo boo bonus for me so anyway I'm going to go ahead and put these in the freezer alright it's been 20 minutes I've started taking these out of the silicon mold that I have and as you can see they just pop right out we were just lying all over the place that makes it a lot easier for cleanup again if you're using a metal mold small little molds or small mini muffin tins and I suggest you use the papers and what I'm going to do is basically just take these put them in the freezer bag and keep them in the freezer makes for a real quick grab and go word of caution a serving size is just one not two or three don't think think of these as an actual Reese's Peanut Butter Cup or the minis because they don't have sugar but what they do pack a powerful punch on is healthy fat the first time I made these I decided ate one we fast my fat Oh before it hit my stomach I thought I'll have another one and I popped it and it felt like I overeat on Thanksgiving so that's how potent these puppies are I'm going to go ahead and pop all these out put them in a freezer bag and go ahead and keep them in my freezer so till then hope you like the video go ahead give it a thumbs up hope you give these a try definitely share it with friends also let me know what type of if you already do fat bombs what type of fat bombs you actually like to do in your low-carb way of love living so until next time I'll see you [Music]", "XGyXhgMmifA": "first the workers take the milk out of the milk king they check the temperature take a

tuesday then i shouldn't have made it when i made mine the longer keto chelsea the better it gets no you do not rush keto tail okay that rhymes the longer it sits good morning val fine good morning gg good morning mr miss how are you today doing good good morning cynthia jean's here so good morning ottman richard d's here says morning good weather happy sunday same to you uh jj said good morning my favorite people woke up just for y'all thank you james we appreciate it uh rashaun is here says grand rising and happy sunday hashtag let's get this party started roshana i totally subscribed to her youtube channel yesterday and i totally watched your video this cop gone keto it was really fun it was really fun it was really cute that was her no that's the name of it oh this cop gone keto i don't think she did it that exaggerated but in my mind that's how i saw it so there you go uh good morning shelley yes so me and mom went on another long walk this morning my fitbit said i did over five miles so i'm just gonna listen to my fitbit even though the nike run app said we did like 4.88 and i'm just like why are they so different you know but regardless my fitbit said over five miles so that's what i'm going to take it exactly so 4.95 or something like that roshana said omg thanks i don't i know it was like it was a cute video like i really i really liked it and i love all the stuff you were just saying about keto in general and talking about how it's a lifestyle it is for shawna so we should expect them nothing but the best basically absolutely exactly now we just expect excellence from you from now on so where is he yeah you're forced down there yes so yeah me and mom went on a long walk it actually was not raining when we sat out on the log about you know 80 into the walk it started to steadily sprinkle it still i wouldn't call it rain but it was just like a steady spring no it wasn't misty it was like there were drops you know but like i mean i don't know maybe it was just rain and it was just a very light rain but now my hoodie is very cold so i should have taken it off yeah it's kind of dry back in the house it's just the sleeves my sleeves was very wet hashtag wet sleeves oh yeah yeah so i don't know i don't even know i wasn't like that i don't know uh dr weiss is here says good morning white fam good morning matreya glad everybody that you are uh glad that everybody is here okay now that everybody's here we get to the start of the show peanut butter cups you guys funny story so i just talked yesterday about how i was so excited to get all the bars out of my house because like i'm in a really you know bad mind state when it comes to bars then yesterday quest sent me a huge packet with two boxes of bars and a box of pb cups but that's okay because like what i can control myself with quest bars they're not the same as like the novelty bars that i get from the internet because you'll get a quest bar at the store you know like the appeal is not there you know so it's just like oh good i can actually start to use these as part of my meal prep and like i don't have to buy dessert from now on because like i have you know quest bars so there you go i'm excited um but then they also sent me these peanut butter cups which i'm excited about because a lot of people have asked me if i've tried them and i said no because have you guys seen them to where they just sell them in these little two packs or do you could you only buy a box of four two packs and i was like i don't want to buy a box of four two picks i've never i haven't had these i don't spend eight dollars on a you know two two pack because i did see them in target first of all target was the only place i saw them but then secondly i only saw them by the box but now since questing them to me oh for free you know i don't try them so uh okay so let's see what they look like these are the most peanut butter cup looking things that i've seen in a while i mean they even have that signature brown paper that i love okay pretty spot on yes i mean this quest we're talking about yes okay do you wanna bite well of course i like racy tips yes all right so percentage-wise how much am i allowed to cheat you if you want that whole thing you can have it 50 okay because i but i just figured you wouldn't so i was like there's no point giving you the whole thing oh okay so it's not as soft okay first thing we noticed definite thicker chocolates of peanut butter ratio it is not the typical you know so that's why it made a lot louder of a crunch when he bit into it because he had to bite through the chocolate okay oh that's good oh yeah i could definitely have it all you don't want it no i'm about to eat this one okay so this is chocolate done right it's not a reese's cup well that's obvious but it's really good i'm saying it i mean yeah the chocolate i guess it's a little darker so it's not as sweet but the peanut butter filling does a good job of counterbalance it's really good so it's back to a wonderful little chocolate peanut butter taste i love it wow i love it and i'll definitely say one i wouldn't buy these because no because it's too much i would be forced to open all of them and just eat eight like i could just like eat eight cups you know i could definitely buy these as a great replacement for a snack a wonderful little peanut butter cup perfect i really like this i watched when matt mega from keto connect tried them and either matt or mega really didn't like them and i was like oh no but they're not as bad as they said they were huh man better be going like him i want a peanut butter cup without all the guilt yeah great great great choice that is a great choice that was delicious um roshana said i don't like peanut butter cups maybe an almond butter or pecan buttercup that sounds good that is not what that is but yeah if you find somebody to mix it up you let me know um shelly said i love peanut butter and chocolate everything i'm not picky about the brand i know right like yeah that's all about taste like if it tastes too weird that tastes actually pretty spot on yeah these definitely taste pretty spot on those were those were good so there's nowhere to have to taste it's like chocolate and peanut butter well when it says a serving sizes two of them so one one package and it says that there's only one net carb for two of them wow i don't mind that at all so yeah that was good so yeah that was that was really really good so i am pleased with that um i also am pleased with the fact i think it pairs well with the uh pumpkin caramel spiced keto jab jeffrey says game frozen skyrim so is your skyrim game frozen or is there a separate game called frozen skyrim like okay so skyrim it's frozen i'm sorry what is that on both like ps and uh xbox oh sorry everything um okay well i'm glad that you're here since your game froze up it's on nintendo switch mattress said how many total carbs for two of them there are 13 total carbs it's four fiber and eight erythritol so that's the 12 net carbs where you subtract it 13 total carbs for two chocolate cups like this honestly that's not that's not bad for me like i could go like a whole day carnivore like eating very few total carbs and then just have these as like a super super like um processed treats yeah you know like yeah it's it's like i don't got to think about that at all i'm just going to buy it those are delicious i just don't know like those are two delicious little too delicious those are good yes best said morning family those are so freaking good you're right i'm glad that you're here best but yeah perfectly delicious that was the first me that was first time me trying those and they are very very i agree it's the first time yeah so yes um so this is good yes these is good so uh yeah that's what we are yeah so i got two boxes of bars from quest yesterday and i was very excited about that oh yeah so your bars are black at replenish yes but in like a non-obsessive sort of way and like i'm actually gonna integrate these in the meal prep so exactly that's so funny exactly what unless you got rid of the bar yeah and then the two boxes just showed up i was like what the but hey i love quest bars and they're my favorite flavors let me go get them well only one is my favorite yeah i hear this only one's a favorite but she got a two well i think the second one you really like though too right yes don't get me wrong there's there's there's rarely a quest bar that i come across that i don't really like but this first flavor now like when we go to meyer sometimes and i'm feeling like you know yellow on a friday this is the one i will actually get chocolate no what is it peanut butter brownie smash um because it's like dual it's like dual layered like that oh my god it's absolutely my favorite um but then the second one they got bam s'mores i was like oh my god anybody ask you first course but like i'm so excited because this actually has little chunks in it you know it's kind of like um like little gram chunks and then like a toasted marshmallow taste yeah so these are really good so i was excited to receive these i was like okay so they disappeared at a thin air yes they appeared out of dinner get rid of your old bars yes um matreya said i should play skyrim again but i have guild i accidentally killed my in-game spouse how do you accidentally kill yourself i mean there's no swords you can swim just swipe anywhere that's some game of thrones type stuff we're like oh my god the wife died like nobody expected a complete accident no one knows um we didn't see that yeah so yesterday was a good day i did a lot of work and i watched a lot of tv i watched i'm i'm cranking through season three of outlander some really weird stuff is going on where i'm like really this is where we're taking it i still want to listen to the books so bad so i am going to everyone who does anyone have an exercise bike at their house like comment your favorite brand or like what should i look for on amazon because i am going to get an exercise bike and then i'm pretty much committed to doing 75 heart at this point so when i do um when i do my outside workout it'll just be 45 minutes of bike riding and i was like i could listen to outlander then you know i could listen to anything then but yes so that's what i'm going to do is i'm going to do 45 minutes of outdoor cycling uh listening to like an audiobook so that's what it sounds amazing that sounds absolutely amazing uh debbie said i wonder how they would taste with ice cream delicious like just cut i would i would chop them up before you know the um the cups because you can't break them like you can a reese's because the chocolate layer is so thick but if you chop that up that would be delicious um rashauna said autumn i loved when you asked what is your favorite food color on your full day of eating video i'm gonna say yellow but then vicky brought up a great poet about brown because she was like chocolate steak she named so many other things that were brown and i was just like those are that brown is a good food color too but yeah no i like yellow like butter eggs cheese like corn even though i don't eat it a lot but my my favorite color of things to eat even like corn bread that whole because the biscuits were like yellow too you know she was like oh this is so great so yes it was yellow is my favorite food color might as well have to be more white or pink pink is that is that your steak yeah but like you know seafood oh yeah no pink makes a lot of sense i was gonna go with white mix because like that's the color of vanilla ice cream so yeah so i was gonna go with white and potatoes [Music] yes everybody comment uh what's your favorite food color shelly said yeah what color is baked bacon pink brown i would go brown see so i would lump that in with the brown you definitely need brown for all your meat yes yeah like see ground beef is brown like yeah like i love brown i love the color brown brown and yellow i could probably live my whole life only eating foods that were brown or yellow like so that's really crazy i love a rainbow on my i want every color doctor why said i have a good old walmart uh fine exercise bike i see i'm gonna have to go to walmart you know but they've actually stepped up their exercise like department i'm like gosh i don't need goals jim's version of this treadmill can i just get a cheap treadmill so well i'll have to have everything you need to yeah i'm assuming since you want to watch stuff on it it needs something that has a tray or something that can hold something yes so you can't just get anybody but i'm mainly but i'm listening to stuff too like so i all i need to just put something in my pocket and like i have my headphones yeah i thought you would like watch the actual video no no no no okay no no i know i would just listen to it yeah i thought you wouldn't have your pad there no although i wouldn't i wouldn't mind having something where i could put the the pad there so that i could watch netflix if i wanted to no but at most part i'd just be listening i have it on my hip just be listening to audio so i'm gonna get something that's upgraded i think eventually one day you might want to put something yes exactly so i want to make sure that it has that ability no i i don't need it to have a screen i just need to have a place for it to hold my screen but uh yeah and i don't really know if i need it to like be super super fancy in terms of like the screen that comes with it as in like you can program your little like doing hills and all that stuff like that do all that even though roshana said brown yeah ribeye burgers bacon chocolate chocolate and more chocolate you right so i'm yeah i'm obsessed once you cut that ribbon open that's good yeah material said pink smoke ring on the brisket no i was looking maybe we were watching food network and they cut a brisket i was just like i just don't like it i don't let's also talk about your pork that finished yesterday where is that can you show it to them or is it like not in a container easily to transplant that's really big okay no so we can't transport it either way he shredded all of his pork and it was really good a lot of it was still too soft for me yeah it was still cool but you just don't like it but there was just some little outside crusty pieces where i was not like chewy anything that's juicy and moist no hair is chewy and gummy no that's not true because like i could have like the meat itself can't be chewy but like i like chicken noodle soup so like the soup drown in the you know in the broth is okay but it's not fat it's i don't i don't like gummy you know different that's like boiling and sitting in broth and stuff exactly so i like moist juicy so moist juicy is not the problem it is gummy because that is mostly chicken chicken breasts you have like chicken thighs in it with like the gelatinous pieces and stuff like that no because that's literally gummy gail said good morning ottoman richard and whack fam can only stay 10 minutes i got my kerrygold stash yesterday at costco awesome did how many did you get i literally wrote kerrygold back on our shopping board that we need to get so um jj said i ordered an exercise bike last year from walmart when it got here it was smaller than me i'm only five one i was super mad i know right that i also have worries ordering things off there uh dr said brown is the color for me all the meat's cooked i know right so shelly said yeah i love before it was really good like immediately yes it was the pulled pork was really good the little edges that i got to were really good so you just didn't like this standard pulled pork though you like yours extra crispy is that the standard pulled pork it really is the same because even at ketopalooza when we went to when we went to dinner i got pulled pork and of course they didn't have any uh sugar-free barbecue sauces so we all ate dry meat and i ended up picking off the pieces that i could that the tougher pieces that i gave the rest of richard i do remember that the middle of the pulled pork is really like chewy and juicy and light you don't like it's not crisp it's not burnt it's not crispy anymore gail said only got two packs but that'll last me a while yeah it was just me by myself that would last me a while too but boy knows my husband loves to cook with butter butter as if you don't love it i love i i measure out how much butter i use so it would last you don't measure nothing you don't measure nothing especially not butter butter is just made to be cut off in packs and put into a pan joe rae is here yeah i said i measure my butter also yeah no my husband doesn't measure [Music] said i'm about to eat pork chops though also tasty no don't like pork chops love like your food schedule like you just have the heartiest of meals at 9 30 am easter eggs nothing no meat's bonely correct no meat on bone i just can't do it everything nice that was such the proper pronunciation of that like i am obsessed so this is me not amused right now you're supposed to be funny richard you're so funny don't hug me if it's all wet you're squeezing my weight somehow somehow down yeah from the elbow they're still wet so yeah today we are officially doing nothing today is football sunday i'm very excited we are going to make some high key blueberry pancakes i know i'm excited and then in this f this afternoon i'll be doing taco bowl so i'm very excited about that yeah i'm eating on plan sunday and tuesday and then i'm fasting on monday and wednesday and then thursday is thanksgiving okay you guys i'm gonna ask you this be honest do you want me to do vlogmas it's okay if you say no you know like i totally understand vlogmas is a series of videos where i vlog every day in december like up until christmas yeah i've done vlogmas for the last three years you remember last year on vlogmas that's when i introduced you to everybody and i was just like i got a fiancee oh my gosh i know background shelly shelley's like yes gail said yes do it val said of course we do i know i know beth said yes i know i figured this was pretty much gonna be yes i just want to make sure you guys care because i just feel like what do i be doing says they make boneless pork chops um but you're not really a whole you're more of a ground meat person yeah like i don't like whole like thick pork like i like bacon because it's really thin but just i mean i can eat like thick pork and pork chops but it's not my preference i would never choose it dr weiss said steeler sundae you right who are they playing today honeybun oh oh the yaguas oh yeah that's what mike tomlin was like we respect the heck out of that team yes he did you think that everything have you laced it up yes uh if you're on the nfl field we gotta have respect for you okay guys so i'll be doing vlogmas yeah um that's okay uh restaurant said vlogmas is a thing oh yeah vlogmas is definitely a thing thank you vlogmas is a thing so generally what happens is i will um vlog for a day and then i will wake up like six o'clock the next morning and i'll edit and post that video from the day before oh wow so and it's just something that happens every day so i know right now sometimes i had to skip a day because like i'm just like i can't get this video out in time for it to make sense but you know um but yeah i mean it's fun to go back and look on all that stuff so that's okay yeah it's oh gayle says the boneless can be kind of dry said bonnie see or that's the way i believe abstain from pork chops all together and there's the there's the bottom line right there everybody i just won't eat them yeah i don't need to figure out in my life how to make pork chops you just like i skipped it yeah like i don't it's not at me to figure out like i got to make these juicier how do i make these tastes better i'm like i just want to eat them like i don't care i don't care that much no no no not as adventurous as i so yesterday was a fasting day i had my coffee so i actually love that now like i don't have my products coffee coffee no i don't have my coffee on my eating days anymore i only have a coffee on my fasting day ah i didn't i know you switched it up i did switch it up like that so now coffee is not part of meal prep i only have coffee and he freed up a little bit of space there plus it comes out to about 300 calories so plus i do have a few calories on my fasting day um and it keeps me warm and so you know like that's like i like doing that so i'll be doing that for the foreseeable future especially during the cold months so yeah because if i'm not eating on those days at least i can have the coffee to warm me up so that was good all i had was coffee made it in the blender i am a changed woman oh i watched joe and rachel's video about how to make keto chow ice cream so i'm gonna attempt that probably not today probably on tuesday because i've already had my keto child today so i'm gonna try it on tuesday all they did was use cream and almond milk and ice but they had a vitamix and they used a lot of ice at one time and i was like ooh maybe that won't work but somebody in the comments said that they just used a regular blender and put five or six ice cubes in there at a time and i was like oh maybe i'll do that so i'm gonna try kenosha ice cream on tuesday you're welcome ice cubes um yes nice gayle said bye everyone gotta go to zoom worship we'll catch the rest of the replay bye gail good to see you um yes uh rashawn uh jj said rashad i'm gonna try i was gonna do the one chip challenge today yes tell us all about that jj what is a one chip challenge i think i said hot chip right just like where you only have to eat one of them you gotta go buy them yeah i think it's like a flaming like a ghost pepper chip or something interesting if i remember it might be a different challenge yeah matriarch said pretty sure every coworker i have would demand i have my coffee before we start having meetings um chris is here just before the end yes top of the morning to you chris i tried the vanilla keto chow with i poured some cake batter extract into that this morning like well i made it yesterday but richard brought up the great point that it was like i was drinking cake batter and that's exactly what it was and there was never there was never anything wrong with drinking cake batter so that was really really good i just wanted to tell you that the vanilla was good um you know but the the cake batter made it a little yellow once again my favorite food color um and yeah it was just really good it was i used a teaspoon i measured a teaspoon of uh gelatin so and i used more water so the consistency was thinner yeah it was just really good all around yes um chris said got a toki a turkey in the smoker is that for like today or like is it like for thanksgiving would you leave a turkey there so i don't i don't know how that works i think it might just be uh that said i use ground pork for egg roll in a bowl or egg rolls uh fried and cut the carb yes absolutely see i like ground pork i just don't like just the thick exactly you just can't have the you need something well grounded that's why you absolutely love hamburger yeah matreya says yeah you have to use a vitamix or a blendtec for their recipe maybe a high-end ninja would work but otherwise you get chunky yeah i say i i will see if i can integrate it slowly and then i could do that so okay jj says that one uh hot chip you're right richard okay i didn't know anything about that celebrities used to do it and everything's like one chip you buy i'm just supposed to like make coffee interesting i mean me it's too intense for you to try the chips shelly said i'm going to try the chocolate mint uh keto child this week you convince me i'll add gelatin this time it is really good like it tis really remember don't do the three to one ratio instead of the one to three um yes do the two and two yeah don't make it too thick measure a teaspoon don't just eyeball it just measure a teaspoon so um richard said i have three keto chows left i'm going to make the banana one into ice cream that sounds good chris said i've never drink cake batter call me maybe i mean we'll call you weird i'll i'll call you both uh don't get me started on uh what is it carly ray jepsen that song was amazing um chris said miriam believes in turkey for multiple dinners so we're having one today and another one on thursday this should only be in the smoker for five or so hours okay so okay also see like turkey dressing these are types of foods i only have but once a year so prepare them hope your skyrim i'm freezing right now i'm saving more before your quest um debbie said are you doing 10 total carbs to the end of the year or 10 net carbs so starting in december i'll be doing 10 total carbs like i'll just be like lowering it all the way down and you do not touch turkey unless it's thanksgiving yeah i mean it's not that i don't it's not that i don't like it it's once again i would just never make it for myself if you made turkey it'd be like oh piece of turkey but like i'm not like i guess to have me you know never i will never like desire you know crave turkey yeah miriam's here says hey wax pam how is everybody i'm doing great so turkey for easter and like turkey yes there's a couple holidays growing up you used to have before uh matreya said i'm glad to catch a live stream today miss them for a couple of days i know i've noticed uh it's been crazy i really appreciate the hosting of them oh they're my i mean it's my favorite thing to do so you're teaching three classes today you're a teacher oh i'm so sad i know right that's impressive chris said went to the supermarket yesterday they had a spend 100 to get a 20 pound turkey but they had a full-on prime rib roast for five dollars a pound so we bought a bunch of that and got a third turkey that's ridiculous that's so much they do have like crochet classes oh that's amazing it's a tune of children over there so i'm pretty sure that's going to go really fast exactly see i don't understand family cooking so that probably makes a lot of sense i grew up with family i know i don't have a family richard thank you no so once again i don't understand family cooking because i only grew up in a household with multiple people when i was a child and i never cooked and then by the time i cooked for myself i was only cooking for myself so i've never had to cook for a family or seen it done before at all no yeah because really my family cooking was like oh there's riceroni on the stove there's potatoes on the stove there's stuff on the stove you just go get it you know so there was we didn't really have meals you know what i'm talking about okay so i stepped on scale today and i was 182.4 that's a loss of 2.2 um shoulder shrug like i just have like i'm very uh apathetic about my weight at this point like it is what it is it doesn't make me feel any sort of way either or the only thing that i'm working on is exercising and um fasting on the days where i'm fasting so there you go yeah that's all that matters chris said i only know how to cook for 20 people i know right so i don't i mean i don't know how to cook for more than one person i've gotten out of i think my optimal number is four no i know how to cook i know how to cook for me one person but generally my portions are so large that it would make sense to divide into so i can cook for two so you do actually when you meal prepping yeah i guess i'm cooking for four if we all ate that at once you know so we're finding out so many family cooking family cooking i'm okay so yeah we're gonna go ahead and get off here because the sooner we stop talking to y'all the sooner we start having pancakes i don't know why but richard is letting me make the pancakes again because it's my idea i wouldn't want to be like hey richard do you want pancakes for breakfast and he'd be like sure but like okay you make them because i'm so bad at it like so i'm making them because it's my idea so and then so we're having pancakes and then football so everyone have a great day and we will talk to you tomorrow at 9 30 a.m eastern bye everybody yeah there are", "vM9hhMRn988": "hey guys how you doing dude from cooking chair here one of my all-time favorites is peanut butter cups you know they're the ones who put chocolate on the outside the peanut butter wedged in the middle well we went ahead and created a recipe simple as possible only three ingredients you're going to love it so let's get started I'm going to get started here by lining a muffin tray with some liners you can go ahead and use candy cups but I had these on hand and just thought I'd use these that's what we're gonna do is place a bowl over some boiling water and you just want kind of oh I'd say a light boil here put in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and actually you can use any kind of chocolate chips you want I just like the semi-sweet so we're just going to stir these and let them melt down over medium-high heat and this will take you somewhere in the neighborhood of oh I'd say about five minutes what's is melted down to texture something like this just remove from the pod scoop up a tablespoon and pour it into the bottom of the muffin cup you can use an ice cream scoop for this or even a couple of spoons for that matter now simply pick up the muffin tray and give it a tap down you might want to put on some music for this all right what we're gonna do next is grab off our five tablespoons of creamy peanut butter I guess you could even use crunchy or your favorite peanut butter and we're going to microwave this for about 20 to 25 seconds because you want it to the point where it's a little bit runny and you can work with it pour a tablespoon of the peanut butter over top of the chocolate if you're in a hurry you can go ahead and add the last layer of chocolate it might run together but you know who knows it might look cool and I'm going to go ahead and put these in the freezer for about five or ten minutes just to let the peanut butter set while they're setting don't forget to click that subscribe button because you don't want to miss a video after about 10 minutes the peanut butter is nicely set so at this point in time what you want to do is give your chocolate a little reheat just so it's nice and runny again then simply pour another tablespoon over the top give it the old tap tap tap again then back into the freezer for another five or ten minutes to let them set and there you have a guys are ever so simple and yummy peanut butter cups so I'm really excited to give these little guys a taste these are really good the ratio of peanut butter and chocolate is just about perfect the flavors blend together so nicely and the great thing is you can control what goes into them and come on who doesn't like peanut butter cups for all the details on this recipe head on over to cook and share calm and don't forget to give us a thumbs up and most of all subscribe if you have any requests as

beautiful murmurs and welcome back to my kitchen today we're gonna make something I can eat a giant Reese's Cup I've seen some other people make giant Reese's Cups but they're like really long I'm gonna go for a height like this hopefully I can get mine to be as high as ten for something to start by coating the walls with a little bit of butter spray to make sure the chocolate does not stick to it so this pan is actually a giant cupcake pan but I made a video a long time ago hopefully it doesn't stick too much to the side come on please pan we'll see what happens you want to start by boiling some water and then putting a ton of chocolate chips in there let it melt keep on moving it around move it around look how beautiful that chocolate is oh my gosh it looks so beautiful now it's perfect and it's all melty so we're gonna put some butter in this pot now melt this bad boy up come on baby yeah now we're gonna keep melting it up put some peanut butter in there then we're gonna keep spinning it around swishing it around oh it smell so good that is some brown sugar in there make some powdered sugar in there this is all sugar no wonder Reese's Cups makes me so chubby look at that look how beautiful that is I'm gonna keep moving this bad boy around it's like it's a little thicker like this then we have put some more powdered sugar in there oh my goodness this looks so beautiful I'd love powdered sugar I'm gonna keep mixing this bad boy around alright so now that you've melted your chocolate you want to go ahead and pour it directly into the pan look at the chocolate it's so creamy so melty going on in there oh there's a lot of you in there truck so now that I have the chocolate melted and it's in here I'm gonna try to get it onto the walls like this look at the walls yes it's okay if it looks messy now I promise we're gonna fix it later after we have made the chocolate top we're gonna put it in the fridge for about 4 hours now and then we're gonna finish this bad boy off the next Melanie all right so now I have it out of the fridge oh it is hard I can't tell anything but it looks delicious so now we're gonna fill it up with my peanut butter mixture all right so now I'm gonna take out as much of this as I can it's really nice it's like a nice like play-doh almost okay I'm so excited about this this smells like the real deal Wow this is the real deal guys you didn't know I'm ambidextrous and I can do I'm just kidding I can't do anything with my left hand I kept right-handed here we go here we go make sure you want to leave enough room for your chocolate layer on top like that keep smoothing it and that looks really good to me now I'm just gonna go put this in the fridge and then get some more chocolate to put on top of it maybe deep tacks lay down all right so I took this out fridge I melted some more chocolate right here and I'm gonna pour it on top to give it that nice cover mmm yes look how beautiful that is I just love the ribbons of chocolate it's so satisfying to watch to me nice little layer on the top now we have filled it to the top I'm gonna set it in the fridge now for a whole day maybe eight hours I don't know I'm gonna let it sit in there and we're gonna come back and pull it out at this mall and finalize a Reese's Cup moment Nadel all right guys that has spent eight hours now and our chiverses cup is now cured in the fridge it is rock solid I'm gonna try to release it from the mold now wish me luck this is gonna be very scary and I'm very nervous let's do this it is down here i greased it up I'm hopefully gonna flip it over and see what happens in three and you in one oh man is right spot it will come out okay nope that definitely did not work that is not a scientifical method okay so I'm gonna go ahead and trim the outside a little bit very delicately and gently and we did it my chocolate J piece this cut looks beautiful all we had to do is not get her anthem play with it for five minutes and I just push the top okay I have one more step to make it look pristine which is we're gonna cover it with more warm chocolate and then harden it again I got my double boiler how this works is there's some hot steam that goes through in the bottom Pels melt my chocolate that's how they're melting on my cup into this whole time I'm gonna grab my wooden spatula my favorite weapon of choice and I'm gonna go ahead and just start stirring so you can see those chocolate is already starting to melt oh my goodness bring it around - now that our chocolate is fully melted it's ready to cut our giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup all right so now I'm pushing it over the edges trying to do a nice even drippity coat then I'm gonna let gravity just do all the magic after that after it's all coated with chocolate now we're gonna put in the fridge for about three more hours graduation days alright so we are back and it is rested now that is hard all of this talk little top is now hard you can hear it

peanut butter cups from the inferno candy company I've done tons of different items from the inferno candy company and I've always been blown away by the quality of these and the quality of their product is their product and I'm sure that these are going to live up to it as well so you guys an idea of what it looks like so they are Carolina Reaper peanut butter cups and I've had some things by the photo candy company that are on like various snackable side and I've had things that like truly bring the heat so I'm pretty interested to see where these line between I haven't seen them yet I have no idea if they're big if they're small I have no idea how hot they are but all right let's crack into them and then see we're getting ourselves into ingredient wise if I'm gonna be stuck in my home filming some videos for a while please let me know in the in the comments below what kind of video if you want to see from me these look awesome I will say that everything I've seen by the inferno camp and candy company is definitely like it's a homemade product it's got this like definite homemade feel to it you know see like look like it there's interesting funny little touches like like the the wrapper on this is like not really the size of it that was crazy that's my cat Freddie by the way who's joining us so you can see it right there looks super homemade alright the ingredients on these things are milk chocolate which is sugar cocoa butter chocolate nonfat milk and then there's peanuts lose peanuts in this like actual peanuts sugar salt Carolina Reaper pepper okay I'm assuming that he made the peanut butter himself maybe he Freddie okay getting into the actual peanut butter cup it's you know I mean like I'm familiar with like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I guess you could say so it's like you know probably half the size of one of those but it's got some like hefty weight to it you know I'm interested to see if it had its like a crunchy peanut butter its smooth inside I don't know all right Reaper source peanut butter cups its give it a taste smooth and hot immediately hot yeah I don't want this blood Wow whoa all right okay I'm gonna say I was not expecting the amount of heat that's in this thing whoa wowzers aw we're not gonna do that oh okay so I'm gonna have a hard time talking through this so first of all absolutely delicious is Kelly a creamy peanut butter taste to it the chocolate is great I'm getting like a little bit all that like Carolina Reaper flavor but it's mostly like all heat mostly all hid it's mostly heat oh it's gonna go to my gut um Wow okay so I would say this is definitely not the snackable level right this is like challenge level and this thing is freaking hot for Carolina Reaper pepper being the last ingredient on this even though I mean there's more salt than Reaper pepper in this this thing is packing a tonic eat well flavors great though like I said it's got thing it's got an awesome chocolate suit I know where he's sourcing his chocolate chopped it's really good the peanut butter it's fabulous it's creamy it's not overly sugary I don't like like really sugary peanut butter it's not a really sugary I wish I salt like thick salt crystals on top of it I think whether they're like a little bit of a bonus would have been like pretty nice but man these things are ripping hot okay you're very list so what's coming up with the channel so as I as your eyes are aware there's a lot of craziness going on in the world I'm not really sure how much I'm gonna be ail to get back to my set so everything kind of calms down a little bit so I'm gonna do some some cooking videos want to do some stuff outside thinking about grilling barbecuing got opened fire cooking style videos do some more stuff my kitchen I might do some stuff where I can actually call in and talk to you the different hot sauce makers so say I'm doing a like a half like one of my sis my normal Sunday video I'm doing a hot sauce like tasting I can you know I'm gonna be myself I probably be skype in like the actual maker or thing gonna be really cool so I'm working on making that happen but regardless it is absolutely crazy out there right now so I hope everybody is staying safe in the description below I'm gonna put a link to the Inferno candy company everything I've had from them has been a super high quality product so ever so it ranges from like the extreme which is this is definitely more on the extreme side to the very snackable side like I said this is probably not snackable it took me at least we're alkalis dead this is not on that snackable scale out of a one to ten I'm gonna give this like I'm gonna say it's six six out of ten on my scale I've got full mouth burn tongue back of the throat my nose is starting to go just a little bit and I'm not tearing but the lip side of my eye he's got just a little bit of wetness balm absolutely brutally hot a great product so inscription

need for this is two ingredients some vegan chocolate I'm using some vegan chocolate chips and you can find this at the grocery store or a health food store and of course you can make your own chocolate at home by mixing together driven oil Calcutta and maple syrup and that will make the recipe world - and of course peanut butter and then some paper cups and that is basically is that is all I have to explain let's get straight into it and start making them place the chocolate chips into a saucepan over low heat and stir until they are melted be careful not to burn them as they will burn angley's we just make sure you stir consistently basically cupcake liners into a cupcake tray then add in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the chocolate depending on the size copped you're using set that aside in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes until firmed up then add in 1 teaspoon of peanut butter in the center to finish you're going to add another one to two tablespoons of the chocolate over the top to cover it [Music] and finally just at those back in the freezer for another 10 to 15 minutes until they're fair so they are ready and I'm excited to try them this is so good but they are so rich and my anyone will sit these days amazing and it's so easy to make to definitely try to yourself thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all in the next in year [Music]", "dBRbf3NEha0": "Justin Trudeau said he legalized pot and now we've got Reese's Peanut Butter hamburger is coincidence i'm corey mints and i'm here about to eat this Reese's Peanut Butter hamburger if you know me you know that I'm a big rhesus fan and my home I have a shelf dedicated to only Reese's products and I'm pretty fond of hamburgers as well what we've got here is an 8-ounce ground beef patty stuffed with Reese's peanut butter cups topped with risa splendor cuffs and bacon on a bun from Ace bakery kinda like count chocula got the hamburger pregnant in my mouth there's also onion rings on here onion strings which I feel a little bit of salt little bit extra salty note make up the difference but clean what you're expecting a black chocolate peanut butter on a burger but you know what i was skeptical going em I'm a believer", "nRNue8Q8y28": "it's Reese's peanut butter cups only white today on walkie in the candy aisle hey everyone welcome to the show my name is Jeff and here we are with another review this time it is white Reese's peanut butter cups yeah I guess that's what they're called white Reese's peanut butter cups oh not Reese's peanut butter cups with white chocolate they're just white meaning white colored yeah from what I have to understand this is not actual chocolate it's just it's mock Lee you know so that's a bit unfortunate especially from Reese's you know they do generally a good job here I'm not gonna bother reading that but you know there's the ingredients if you want to look deep into it wait wait chocolates always a weird thing anyway right anyway it doesn't matter maybe you don't like you know maybe you don't like milk chocolate maybe maybe you prefer white I don't know this is what it is though here it is it's exactly what it says it is a white sort of pseudo chocolate Reese peanut butter cup it just doesn't look as a P I know it's cracked obviously but just doesn't look quite as appealing to me as the standard milk chocolate one which I'm a big fan of doesn't smell I'm a little stuffed up today but it still it doesn't smell like my nose may not be in a hundred percent but it doesn't smell like anything special here white chocolate does not generally give off a major smell though let's give it a try see how it tastes hmm well hmm well it's got the same peanut butter on the inside and that's for sure which for me is kind of the major selling point this is actually pretty good hmmm very sweet rich creamy just the way I like wreath peanut butter cups I guess just the difference here is it's white chocolate or you know pseudo white chocolate whatever hmm trucks are pretty nice like it's very mild the the flavoring of the peanut butter is really overpowering here here like I think the the nice thing that I like about is the most about Reese's peanut butter cups is that mix of peanut butter and chocolate you know like you know that's why you have the hey you got your peanut butter in my chocolate you got your chocolate peanut butter if you'll recall it's a mix and that's sort of the thing is that there's a really special sort of magic about the Reese peanut butter cups with that level of how much peanut butter - how much chocolate and that milk chocolate mix is just like it's perfect this is like the chocolate is is so mild oh no like it's good but it's much more about the white it's much more about the peanut butter sorry um that's the thing a white chocolate it's like it's still smooth it's still got a texture some milk or something to go with that but it's not the same it's not the same as milk chocolate and you know I don't think this is quite as good honestly like I like the Reese peanut butter that's why this is still good but there's just not enough to it to make the white chocolate as good a pairing when you have the milk chocolate version readily available you know everywhere so I'm not sure that this is one for me that's not saying that it's bad but it's not really great either so I'm gonna give this a solid right down the middle three out of five for the white Reese's peanut butter cups anyway that's my take on it what do you guys think is there any big white chocolate fans out there in the community let me know what your thoughts are of this in the comments below if you had a chance to have it and otherwise I hope you enjoyed watching something that may be a little odd a little different to you anyway thanks so much everyone I appreciate your time today we'll talk to you next time so long everyone bye bye", "NwC-8aLvIvk": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel excited to have you here today because we are not only celebrating the 10k milestone for the simply Kingdom Channel but I am also partnering with one of my favorite companies in the entire world Bob's Red Mill to bring you a delicious gluten-free vegan and healthy dessert recipe so if you are interested in learning more about the giveaway stay tuned towards the end of the video and I'll talk about how you can enter but for now let's talk about this awesome dessert that we're about to make so these are my spin on Reese's peanut butter cups instead of peanut butter we are using almond butter in the middle and then we are mixing it with some Bob's Red Mill coconut flour to give it a nice fluffy texture and then I'm also stirring in some quinoa crispies to give it a nice little crunch so it's a mix between a crunch bar and the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but use almond butter basically it's the most delicious thing ever and I know you're gonna love it so keep on watching and we will dive into the recipe first thing we'll need for this recipe is some vegan chocolate then some almond butter some pure maple syrup Bob's Red Mill coconut flour which we're going to use in the filling to make it fluffy some sea salt and some quinoa crispies then to shape the candies I am using a silicone candy mold but you could also use these little paper liners in a mini muffin tin we're going to start by just breaking the chocolate into some pieces and putting it into a heat proof Bowl because we're gonna melt the chocolate and I broke it up into little pieces and then I put it on the stove in a double boiler but you could also use the microwave so this is just a bowl over a pot with some water in it and the water is just helping to give the bowl some heat and melting the chocolate so you're gonna just stir until completely smooth and then you're gonna take your silicone liner and fill each of the little cups with about half a teaspoon of chocolate and then we're just gonna pop that into the freezer for about half an hour once that's done you're going to make the filling so you're gonna add the maple syrup the salt the coconut flour to the almond butter and then just stir it around until it gets fluffy and it's gonna get pretty thick but that's okay you want it thick and then you're gonna add in the Krispies and fold those in and the consistency should be thick enough so that you can kind of squeeze it between your hands and form it into a little ball so that's what we're gonna do we have the frozen chocolate and we're gonna take the filling roll it into little balls only about a quarter teaspoon then you just press it down on top of each of the chocolate things and then we're going to top all of that with some of the melted chocolate and again we're probably using about half to three-quarters of a teaspoon here you can also optionally sprinkle it with sea salt flakes I use Maldon sea salt but that's totally optional you definitely don't have to do that if you don't want to so you're gonna pop back into the freezer for another half an hour and then you're done you're just gonna pop them out of the little molds and you can see how easy watch out they fly away sometimes but you can see how easy they come out of the molds no spraying or greasing necessary and again there's one that escaped and that is it you're gonna want to store these in the fridge or freezer because they will melt but you can see the filling you can see the little quinoa crispies in there and these are honestly the best treat in the entire world and there you have it my friends that is how to make my healthy dark chocolate almond butter cups I hope you give this recipe a try because I know you're absolutely gonna love it if you do I would love for you to come back comment

    music   music  ", "QD-IDOOlQp0": "hey y'all it is summer k here on youtube and tick tock summer pay fit if you follow me on instagram or twitter and make sure you guys are connecting with me on the platform that is best for you because i post a lot of content on every single one of those platforms so bear with me today because i am in a different room so i know there's a little bit of an echo going but i want to really talk to you guys about some healthiest alternatives that you can do during this holiday season so this is around the time that people start to fall off so if you haven't already been set back by the pandemic this can be the time where self-discipline starts to be really hard okay it is okay to have some slips you know kind of set back a little as long as you get prepared to get back on track but halloween passes now on thanksgiving you have the candy that's on clearance you have a thanksgiving food that's about to be right in our faces and it can be hard to keep your goals in mind when you're around family and you're trying to enjoy yourself in moderation so i want to talk to you guys today about two products that you can use especially if you are peanut butter lovers that will keep you from getting the real thing now we are going to go with my favorite product first which is news so this is not sponsored um this is not something that i paid for i just really like this product i feel like it's pretty close to the real thing so i wanted to share with you guys and then the other product of course is something that's been around a lot longer i haven't tried it myself but i have a lot of clients that use it so i decided i'd make a video about it and i'll go through what the nutrition facts are with you guys so you can know which one is best for you now all right so these are the two products neither one of them are sponsored but quest nutrition hi if you want to sponsor me just let me know because i love quest nutrition if you know me then you know that i use their quest protein chips i've done their bars i'm going to be honest with you those bars are something that you should eat if you have not eaten sugar in a while because it is very low sugar it is very keto friendly meaning that it does not have a lot of carbs when it comes to quest nutrition they are in my opinion the best in the field with that one okay the chips are great i use them on ground meat ground turkey and shredded cheese um i do the chili lime loaded tacos sweet chili just to basically give that dorito or nacho flavor and it's by quest nutrition now lily's i've heard that a lot of people like to bake with them they have like some chocolate covered peanuts and things like those so i already knew about lilies now i'm going to tell you guys why i prefer the quest nutrition first and it's not just because they are my favorite brand okay so quest nutrition comes 12 in a box um they come in sets of two and i like that because it reminds me of an actual reese's now i love reese's um i feel like it's pretty close to the taste but i haven't had a reese's in a while this is something that you do whenever you have that craving okay it's not something like if you eat the whole box of course that's not good for you and people need to remember that because a lot of people will say oh look at the amount of calories etc you might as well just eat the real thing it's not meant to just replace your everyday habit of the real thing it's meant to give you that get rid of that craving that you're used to so i'm going to tell you guys about why i like this one um first of all the protein amount a regular reese's of course is not going to have that protein amount in it this one has 11 grams of protein and what i like best is that it's per serving which is two of them so you can eat it as if you're eating a reese's cup the texture i like it's not like a protein bar sometimes when you get a protein bar it tastes like a protein bar it's gritty the texture is weird you just know that you're eating a protein bar and i don't get that from the quest nutrition peanut butter cups so that's my favorite thing about it first of all now it's also one gram of net carbs which means that it is keto friendly so i let a few friends try it just to see how they like it and i mean they liked it but like i said if you're used to eating a lot of sugar then it might not taste good to you but i mean i feel like it would taste good either way you're just going to say it doesn't taste like an actual reese's cup because you shouldn't be eating a reese's cup anyways but what it has in it is 13 grams of carbs okay four of those is fiber which means it's your dietary fiber there's zero added sugar in it now we just went through a sugar detox and i remember talking to you guys about the fact that a lot of people will see healthy things and they don't pay attention to the fact that it has added sugar and that can be detrimental to your goals especially if it's a lot of added sugar i have a favorite bar i post on instagram sometimes it's the outright bars those bars are really good but they're really high calorie really high carbs really high fat and like the one that's my favorite has 16 grams of added sugar so i eat that like once every few weeks i don't even eat it every day so you want to make sure you pay attention to that now this has 8 grams of erythritol which is a natural sweetener i don't know if they say it on here i don't think that they do but you can look up erythritol but basically you take the 13 grams of carbs you take away the four grams for fiber and you take away the eight grams for erythritol and that's how you get your one gram of net carbs okay so like i said look up erythritol i should probably do a video talking about the different types of sugars so that you guys know about that so stay tuned on that but in the meantime you can look it up yourself to see what erythritol is um it also has 15 grams of fat now that is where you know the peanut butter portion get comes in that is where if you are on keto it's fine if you're trying to watch your fat be aware that to me that doesn't make that much of a difference that's perfectly fine with me and then it has 190 calories so i treat it like a meal replacement like i treat it as if i'm having like a one of my snacks in between so it's it fits into my macronutrients if it doesn't fit into yours maybe just have one peanut butter cup and of course you would do the serving size in half but like i said this is pretty close to a reese's peanut butter cup if you haven't eat halloween candy stop that you should not be eating halloween candy at this point i know that it's really hard especially when it's on clearance but it is not going to help you get to your goals and we're about to get into that part of time where everybody's going to be getting ready for the new year so these videos are going to be a lot more frequent because you have to remember that we are trying to keep our goals in mind so if you're going somewhere and you want a snack go for this over at actual reese's cup because this is at least going to give you your protein it's not going to have the same types of fat it's not going to have the extra added ingredients those types of things in there that you might be used to if you eat a regular all right so we're going to get into the lilies now i'm holding this so i can remember what to compare it to but the first thing i want to say is this is sweetened with erythritol this is sweetened with stevia so a lot of people try to stay away from stevia these days for whatever reason um so that's the first thing that you should look at is that it's sweetened with stevia there's no added sugar though so that's the same thing for both of these now the main difference in these is this one is a full package it says that there's three servings per package like i said i haven't opened i haven't tasted it yet but the difference is kind of like whenever you get a smaller plate to make it look like it's more full this here you eat two and you're done this here you eat two you still got some cups sitting in there so a lot of people might eat the whole package so if you're somebody that you know gives into temptation you might want to go with something like this another thing is this has 130 calories per two pieces because that's a serving size whereas this one had 190. this one here only has three grams of protein now it might say it or it might not on there it says the whole package has 10 grams of protein that's still not equivalent to how much is in this one because if you eat this whole bag there's 400 calories in it so you have you're gonna have to do three grams of protein which means you're gonna have to get your protein from somewhere else now it's also sweetened with erythritol five grams and it has 15 grams of carbs so it's got two more grams of carbs than this here and it's got eight grams of dietary fiber which if you want to go looking at that it has two times the amount of fiber that this has which means this should keep you fuller longer but it kind of depends i really don't pay to pay attention to which one makes me feel more full if something has more fiber but that's a comparison that i wanted to make so you guys know so it has 15 grams of carbs you take away the 8 grams of fiber and then the 5 grams erythritol and that's how you get your carbs from that one um this one has 11 grams of fat versus this one had 15 grams of fat so the comparison when it comes to those are pretty different but like i said neither one of these are an issue with my plan it's gonna depend on what type of plan you're on i don't have a problem eating something that's 15 grams of fat and then this has less fat but i am somebody that likes to eat my protein if i'm gonna eat something like this i want it to have protein so i'm gonna go for quest nutrition over lilies because protein is important to me whereas if you are somebody that is doing keto um protein isn't that much of a priority as it is looking at your carbs and looking at your fat so this might be better for you but of course if you're going to eat the whole bag there's no point in buying that because you're going to be outside of your scope anyway so that is pretty much it for these i just wanted to talk to you guys about two healthiest alternatives that you can use right now or if you're just getting back into working out and you want to find some healthy snacks because you know those cravings do start to hit after the first or second week of being on a calorie restricted plan they do start to hit once you see them in the store and once you start exercising you get hungrier quicker so would be good to have some of these handy so that you don't give in to temptation both of these are gluten free so if you're somebody that cannot handle gluten you can have these remember the main difference is this is sweetened with stevia this is not this has 11 grams of protein this has three they both have about the same amount of carbs and this has a little bit more fat with a little bit more calories so let me know if you've tried either one of these products this one here is hot on the market okay when i tried to order from amazon the first time i could not order it i had to order it twice and i couldn't find it in the stores so make sure that you give them both a try you can buy these in the single pack um i forget how much they are they're two dollars and some change if you go to a health food store this one's a little bit pricier so i forgot to add that if you care about the price you'll have to consider that but you get a whole package versus two if you do the singles so that's basically the difference let me know if you guys have tried it if you want to try it or if you have some snacks that you want me to review for you to let you know if they're healthy ish for you or not don't forget to suggest it to other people um so that somebody else can see this especially if you feel like they need to get back on track see y'all in the next video", "fBCRzP9eZCE": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to four different Chuck oh right bars these were mailed to us from Lisa greeter their website is Chuck oh right comm choc Oh RIT e.com and so they she sent me these samples and a way back Eric in Texas had sent me chocolate bars so we just loved them and they're low-calorie and they have higher calorie bars but Eric had send this to low calorie bars and there were just awesome and so these are four that we had never tried I have the triple chocolate fudge and vanilla peanut cluster you better cut Patties and salty call tomorrow these are 100 calories yeah they're all low calorie these OHS they're all header calories except for the triple chocolate it's only 8:05 so we've won this one yes so you went on salty caramel spars hundred calories zero grams of sugar two grams of whatever that says that's that try something try carbs true carbs truth are true or don't and nine grams of protein really need to run elastic and they're gluten free right isn't that what went for a sugar-free nap till 3:00 maltose melt all free high fiber and gluten free yeah one gram of booster I think these are supposed to be good bars for diabetics so Roy I think so it's what they look like Paralympics I'll take a picture at the end be talking about hug yet we're here in this is salted caramel hmm you can see there's a layer of it's covered in chocolate but then there's a layer of caramel at the top and knock your ticket to the wall bar now being at the bar that's a jerrycan it's royal you know love the flavor of that caramel coma is a really good flavor does it have chunks it's awful I did have a salty caramel flavor mm-hmm it's not like a burnt caramel it's good in the density of the bottom bar it is pretty dense but it reminds you of like am i right your requests for someone yeah it's like a quest bar on the bottom really Chandler but then it has that layer of caramel those are excellent I'm shocked because normally the salted caramel does not taste like salted caramel that really touch like salted caramel and sometimes it's very muted to wear and you don't taste the caramel at all that in that bar you do that is awesome and that's all you heard that's really good it'd be a nice walk candy bar oh yeah you would really feel like you've gotten to work at because that the bottom part is a little dim right hole chewy so so you uh you guys actually choose I can take that salt this is the peanut butter cup patty this won't be interesting because you know that yeah there's this was one ground net carbs 20 grams of fiber per package 100,000 Oh sugar added this what a soft Malta one of them ultimate all-purpose sweetness sugar alcohols enough oh my God look at it or tell me before now p-bar can go to the white like the grain rolls in that me tomorrow that's actually not bad at all you know how Reese's Cups have that granular psi it's almost like a sugary peanut butter that feels like a that works like that you're out it's not quite as strong as a Reese's Cup bed does remind me every stuff out of that I'm a doctor I'm ruling so how much these cost per follow I don't know but I'm gonna look it up because the thing that always gets me is the shipping and so when I have gone to order these off of web I won't say the websites because I'm gave your website but when I've gone to other websites to order these the shipping has been so much that I like how we'll have a cart full of stuff and then I'll see the shipping it's like nope not doing it no look as much as the bars yeah so I don't want to do that so it would definitely be worth to see how much shipping is both those are really really surprised so good this is vanilla peanut cluster and no sugar and melt all free had her calories 2 grams of net carbs 14 grams of fiber I should have taken it out free to bake at Mitchell oh oh and this has two two pieces and they look what their full night oh nice small one donut this hidden solved that tastes like a whole piece of awesome starburst candy that something Russell stuber's would have in their box yeah that's good element lots of long though no because it was easier than a it's much softer yeah the texture inside that the nougat or whatever is much much softer more like a like s that are also Stover's filling it's incredibly sweet mm-hmm you can definitely taste the vanilla and the nuts you know you can see them all over the tongue Congrats are broken right now five I'm sorry their fathers are fortunate of fiber yeah 40 grams of fiber only one gram of your name so it's not protein bollocks one of these was and these are made in Evansville Indiana I'm elated yeah I'm shocked this they're so good I knew they would I think pretty much figure that would be good but I was worried about the peanut butter one and so so far I'm just I'm really blown away yeah it's wrong this is the triple chocolate fudge and I'll go ahead and hand it to you and they're all and this is one bar like the parks one so what's a 21st high fiber gluten-free sugar-free military 105 calories zero sugar zero grams of sugar two troop herbs nine grams of protein contains one gram of glycerin yeah this looks very similar to Chrome one good except it has a layer of chocolate mm-hmm that was just okay for me and so bad tastes like chocolate frosting but um hmm it's just okay that's after eating the other ones and where they're so incredibly sweet yeah this one does not come across this way you know there's not that cha-cha her mouth man is a Rolo hmm can I get a roll-off feel yeah but Rolo has caramel in the middle no the chocolate I mean no Roll Tootsie Roll Tootsie Roll ya know I think they're still make about the same yeah still think it might be the same mother type tootsie roll it's got that same deck directions it's your own have a Dempster it has that kind of up it's not super sweet chocolate right its animal definitely but it's not my favorite II I would not it's not bad at all but it wouldn't be my choice no compared to the other ones the other ones were just too good yeah what was your fiber it's a toss-up between the vanilla and the peanut butter one I like salted caramel the best also I think it is three hours you're so shocked that I'm telling you most places missed the mark on salted caramel yeah this is salted caramel if I were to pick one overall I would get okay it's on the car because not only is the flavor good it would take you all to eat it if you weigh that with I like the flavor of the peanut butter in the vanilla peanut butter is definitely my second one and I mean it's right there it's right up but you wouldn't eat those faster you wouldn't eat those faster so he didn't it would be gone it kind of balance it out it's probably by that salted caramel ones but the other ones are if you want a sweet treat like at night you want to fund the sweet low-powered those would be awesome yeah yeah they're very very good I'm very pleased with these and you know just because they were sent to us we always give you our opinion just like we said we would not buy the triple chocolate fudge yeah fine I can throw smell but you know yeah so Lisa thank you very very much for sending us these I hope that everyone else enjoyed these I know I have a lot of people that watch that eat these kinds of bars and I really hope that you will go visit their website because if you haven't tried this brand you really really need to give them a shot the website was choco right.com I will have a picture of them at the end for you and thanks for watching", "wNG2s9t7js0": "doo-doo-doo-doo the key was cookin let's see what's cooking [Music] hello everyone today we're making something called brownie reese cookie cups i found this idea of pinterest i also received an email from a youtuber who brought these to my attention this is more of a technique than a recipe but the end result is amazing so i'm going to show you how to make them I'm using muffin tins for these I used some with silicone liners and I also use the muffin tin that I just greased with cooking spray I just wanted to see what the difference would be you need some cookie dough I bought this cookie dough at the grocery store it is chocolate chip cookie dough I took the cookie dough divided it among 18 of these muffin cups I bought a tablespoon or so in the bottom of each and I just press them into the bottom of each of the muffin cups now you'll need some Reese's peanut butter cups these packages have four of the little Reese's Cups in them remove the paper and just gently press it into the cookie dough I bought enough to make 12 of those with Reese's peanut butter cups and I had 18 so T's up the remaining six I just put some Oreo cookies instead of the peanut butter cups and I was curious to see how those would turn out then I mixed up a brownie mix I just used one right out of the box mix it up according to package directions put it in a ziploc bag cut the corner off and then I'm just squeezing out some brownie batter to completely cover the peanut butter cup and the cookie dough as it turned out the brownie mix I used to have just enough to cover 18 of these little cups worked out perfectly I just gave it a little tap to make sure the brownie batter was spread out evenly and then I bake it at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes until the brownies were set and when I stuck a toothpick in it came out with just a few moist crumbs on it now with cookie and Reese's Cups and brownies I mean just those ingredients you know right away that these were good and they were they weren't disappointing at all my favorite were the ones with the peanut butter cup in the center because they were chewy and moist and they were really really good the ones when the Oreos were okay as well but I found them to be a bit dry and a bit too crunchy in the center so it depends on what you like but if you have someone that loves chocolate and peanut butter and cookies and brownies that would be perfect for them right there give it a try", "EmlmnNkZrWY": "I work on the corporate communications team at the Hershey Company the recent brand is named after HP Reese who invented the product he's from Hershey Pennsylvania Milton Hershey who is the founder of Hershey company knew him bought the brand and now as part of the Hershey Company family and to settle it once and for all it's Reese's Peanut Butter Cup not Reese's Reese's there is no wrong way theories one of the right ways is to put it in the freezer and eat them cold very good [Music]", "Q8PNJFwGzrM": "god I love watching this guy he's so funny man everything he says it's a crack-up this is amazing god I love this guy oh man he this is comedy gold right here you know what though I'm feeling kind of

so let's get to it but before I get started I want you guys to like this video and subscribe to our Channel please so today we're gonna be showing you how to make a healthy version of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but it's going to be program approved with one of our feelings it is so easy to make it's one of our favorites and who doesn't love peanut butter and chocolate combination you just can't go wrong so I'm just gonna go ahead and start we're gonna take our little container here first thing we're gonna do is line up with some saran wrap because we're gonna stick this in the freezer if we want it to be able to come out nice and clean without any kind of problems so we're just gonna line this kind of set it aside we're not going to be using that bowl right now aligned like this take another little Bowl Chris is gonna hold it I am going to be putting our brownie mix in so this is our decadent brownie decadent chocolate brownie actually super chocolaty super delicious now in those three tablespoons of water a wood green okay go ahead and miss you're really careful not to spill it remember that our fuel you don't you want every morsel in there because it's that good if you guys haven't seen these yet these are amazing yeah I bought this on Amazon it's like a three pack or something I don't know but they're super handy something I just want to also say right now is we love these feeling hikes these are great we're in maintenance so it's a little bit different if you're just starting out on your journey though you might not want to get too carried away thinking you can have something like this every day this is more of just like a treat so all of our feelings are great they're great by themselves but sometimes you want something elevated this is a really great elevated dessert you know it replaces a recent peanut butter cup with one of our fueling all of our feelings have 24 vitamins minerals and probiotics in them remember these are designed perfectly to put us into fat burn we're losing weight eating Reese's peanut butter cups the other question yes Louise Michigan no go for it yeah okay on to the next step we're gonna take another little Bowl and we are adding our PB Fit butter to that serving size is two tablespoons go ahead and add that in and four people on program that counts as one your it does you are correct thanks coach and it's not this size either don't pull it crisp it humane if the rules about want the extra calories man this is good now two tablespoons of water go into there one all right now we're gonna mix this up it's gonna be nice and creamy just like peanut butter it's great if you haven't had this stuff you really should buy something I'm Circle so it's gonna be nice and creamy that's what we want you're good to go I got a question for you are are we doing this um no keep that don't work this game just yet all right here we go we got our Bowl that blind remember we did that step this is gonna be perfect hold on got my spatula here okay so now I'm putting half the batter in the bottom and we're gonna do layers just like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup or the decadent chocolate brownie is probably one of the tastiest chocolate treats that we have here my fingers are clean don't burn I'm not gonna lick your fingers now we are putting our peanut butter mix right on top you want to get it all and look at that right on top that's still eat it just like that last step is putting the remaining brownie batter on top you got your chocolate your pb2 and your chocolate on top so this is good to eat reberty right now no so at this point now we're gonna stick it in the freezer but I have good news I already made one all right going in the freezer just like a real cooking show babe it's already good this was such an important part to do you don't want to skip this step because look at how easy it is to pull out let's plate that sucker it's showing a real presentation of this thing I mean this is crazy good guys you're telling me that I can have this as one of my feelings yes that's what I'm saying you know I'm saying that that is a fuelling peanut butter cup if you're like us and our family we love Reese's that's probably why we got in so much trouble but you're telling me that I can have basically the same exact things I know how that decadent brownie tasted and it is delicious right and that pb2 is pretty legit itself so all right I just cut a corner off and this is actually perfect but now you can see exactly inside this thing it's got the dry chocolate chips peanut butter and the decorative brownie hmm I know I always says but that was amazing who would have thought here's another example how we eat guys it's good food it's healthy food it's got and by the way all of our feelings are pretty much the same nutritional content give or take not not exactly but it's about a hundred little runner calories it's got 12 to 14 grams of protein and they're really low in fat this is what I'm talking about I want something sweet before I go to bed and that's something that I'm gonna do and you saw it in this video literally took a few minutes to prepare that sucker in my past I have a major sweet tooth like I would eat Ben & Jerry's I hate to say it three four times a week sometimes and I'm not talking about a half we've been there I wouldn't the whole thing no wonder I was 200 pounds and then some that's what I love so much about this is there's so many different feelings for us if we want savory if we want sweet this is just a way healthier version of our favorite things it's a no-brainer we hope you guys like this review this is kind of stuff we're making over here again if you like this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe we'll see you next one [Music]", "REyRTjS0yEk": "hi guys and larvae tally you know this episode of Laurie - kitchen I want to share with you my recipe for chocolate peanut butter balls now listen I know that these are usually made around the holidays but I'm not bound to a holiday to make a treat estimate treat I am assessed with these this recipe actually was influenced by one of Joe's family members and she actually makes these around Easter and Mother's Day and Father's Day like pretty much all year long and since Father's Day and Mother's Day are kind of coming up I thought this would be a really great treat to package up in a nice little box and give to your loved one for a nice little treat or a present or whatnot they are so easy to make they should really be called chocolate peanut butter crispy balls but whatever you say potato I say potato is the same thing you're going to set off with some confectioner sugar you also need some rice cereal any kinda you like some creamy peanut butter a little bit of unsalted butter and you're going to need a little bit of vanilla extract and you're also going to need just a couple more ingredients to make the chocolate coating but that's going to come in a little bit so for now it is so easy and simple just you wait and see I've got a small saucepan into my sauce pan I'm going to add my unsalted butter and I'm just going to melt this over about medium heat and then we'll add our next ingredient okay this is about where I wanted to add the vanilla and now I'm going to just turn that off and I'm going to add my peanut butter I sprayed my little bowl with some nonstick spray so that it kind of pops out really easily and now I'm just going to take my time and mix in the peanut butter and the butter until everything is nice and creamy and smooth you might have to turn this back on medium heat in order for it to melt a little bit quicker but just take your time and be patient I should have used a much bigger skill you know much bigger saucepan but what can I say can't think right sometimes okay how fabulous is that looking I like to take a bath in there so if any of you you want to go and buy a few I don't know thousand things of peanut butter and butter and fill the bathtub for me yet appreciate it okay so this is done and now it's just a question of putting everything together it's really easy you've got your rice cereal your confectioner's sugar and want to pour this lusciousness all over the top now I do want to say one thing you can adjust the amount of confectioner's sugar that is in this recipe you can adjust it to however much you like now some people like to put like a pound of sugar in here mmm I on the other hand like a modest amount to much but yet not too little I think this is a perfect amount but if you make this recipe and you give it a taste along the way and you just find that it needs a little more sugar than by all means just add a little bit more sugar now what you need to do because you'll think to yourself it's never going to come together it's never going to hold but it will what you need to do is just be patient and mix this with your spatula until every piece of every little bit of powdered sugar is no longer visible you want it to be really incorporated you want that rice crispy you know that rice cereal and the powdered sugar to be well coated in that buttery mixture so just take your time and give it a good mix get that upper body workout that you forgot to do this morning get it done now this is what you are looking for okay so now what I have here is I just filled my bowl with a little bit of water and I also have a baking sheet with some parchment paper that I've sprayed with nonstick spray and I've got my little handy dandy little ice cream scoop that's about a teaspoon size and what you're going to do is you're going to just form them for now and then we'll give you all a roll once you have formed them because you could do this just with your hands but I always find that they kind of vary in size so form them and then we'll roll them and we'll get them chilling once you have them all sort of form you know you got all your you're battering the same size you want to just take your hands damp them with a little bit of water otherwise it's going to just stick to your hands and give them a nice little roll they don't have to be perfect I mean mine certainly on perfect some are bigger than others but who cares that is a beauty of anything that's homemade you know it's got that rustic sort of charm to it now once I have rolled each one I'm going to pop this into the fridge these need to set for a good couple of hours you can even do this the night before makes life really easy if you've got a bunch of people that you're making these for you can double or triple the recipe it's completely up to you they're really fantastic if you're doing like a baby shower or a bridal shower or just anything like that will you do just you know give out a favor I always love giving out food so this is a great one to me because everyone loves them and they're just so easy so I'm just gonna form them let them chill and then we will cook them okie dokie these I've had a couple of hours in the fridge and they are set and they are perfect and ready to go so you're gonna need to make you see how I went just for like one thing to another if it isn't so excited it's not even funny you're going to need to make a chocolate coating to coat these in what I've got here are some semi-sweet chocolate chips and some vegetable shortening it's kind of important that you have your vegetable shortening it's going to give you the right consistency the right shine and mix it up to that the chocolate won't crack you can melt this over a double boiler or you can do it I'm going to do I'm going to pop it in the microwave on the melted chocolate setting and let it melt for about 60 seconds giving it a stir every 15 seconds or so to make sure it's getting melted evenly so I'm going to pop this in and then we'll go kit we'll get to coating okay this looks perfect and now you just take your little peanut butter balls you can do this with two forks if you want to or you can do it with your fingers however your heart desires and you just dip them in there and like as all that's in my Sal voice by the way and you pop them right back on to your baking sheet now I'm just going to continue to do these as quickly as I can and then I'm going to let them set and then we'll be ready to enjoy them I pop these in the fridge only for about 15 minutes so that they accept and don't worry if they don't look all perfect because look when you pick them up and you just sort of clean around the edges you're good to go listen this ain't no lower in a chocolate factory this is lhara in the kitchen so my food will look like it's been made in this kitchen no factory here but it's really easy and really simple see like that and then this can be the Cook Street and then it look like beautiful little truffles of love real creamy peanut buttery crunching perfect mMmmm that is I don't even you have to make these they're not like some some of these if you have the main really bad they're so hard that's it'll like that I like them to be really nice and creamy in the crunch coming from the quitting on the rice cereal that is the peanut butter ball I like and if you are in the same boat as I am about texture and flavor and the right amount of sweetness this is a recipe for you go to Laura in the kitchen calm the recipe we'll be waiting for you make a batch of these this weekend for your friends and family take a picture share with me on social media tweet me so I can retweet retweet retweet retweet and tell you how much I

kitchen audience experiment right now what is your favorite cookie baked good candy whatever that is whatever you like number one guilty pleasures i want you to comment it down below who knows i might use it in a video but for me my number one favorite has to be peanut butter fudge and it's not like i ever buy it i might only have it a couple times a year for some reason when i go back home for the holidays and i'm visiting my family every house i go to there's like a plate of cookies and on that plate of all the assortments is these little squares that are so tempting basically it's just sugar and fat terrible for you between december 23rd to december 28th i ate so much peanut butter fudge that the kebler elf house burnt down i've been praying for them but today we're gonna drastically cut down on the calories we're gonna ramp that protein up and i'm telling you this is so easy even if you got a monkey banging cymbals between those ears of yours there ain't nothing stopping you from making this one in today's video we'll be making anabolic peanut butter fudge all that delicious peanut butter flavor locked into a high protein treat if you've been wanting a late night snack but you don't want to add to that late night done lap then look no further than this video because i'm telling you it just might change your life you already know man that rjf anabolic cookbook this recipe is now in there man it just keeps growing every time we drop a video this guy gets bigger and the best part is you get it once you get every future spi out for free seriously if you're trying to find a diet that's sustainable one you can actually do long term we're not giving up food you're just making better choices and i'm telling you man this thing might be for you so if you guys are ready to go epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] i'm only watching tv we are going to start this lovely video off with a food scale and a mixing bowl if you don't have a food scale in 2021 i imagine your parents still cut your food up into pieces so you can chew them better first thing we want to add is 92 grams of egg beaters basically egg whites with some extra stuff added to make them look like regular eggs that extra stuff helps all this bind together but if you only have egg whites that's fine too next up we need 64 grams of peanut butter i'm using gif natural or is it gif is that the other way around just wash that scale and plop her in now we're going to toss in 32 grams of pb fit powder i got peanut butter on my finger it's basically regular peanut butter that started living more active and following the anabolic diet it's got way less fat just throw a nice dollop in there and watch that scale at this point we got these three things in here and what i'm gonna do is go in and mix everything up [Music] and at this point it looks like what happens when you give your dog too much people food you're never getting that out of the carpet and now what we're gonna do is add in 62 grams of a vanilla based whey protein powder i'm using that final boss cinnamon toast swirl if you're making these recipes by god this protein will never let you down unlike these politicians now i'm going to go in and give it all a mix one more time at this point it's looking pretty good but it's still a little sticky and not the consistency we want so we've got a few more things to add i'm gonna do about 40 grams of white flour 10 grams of zero calorie sweetener and then this part's optional but i like to add a couple grams of salt now i'm just gonna go in one final time mix everything together until we have a ball and i'll show you what we do next [Music] now that we got it all mixed up i'm gonna grab a piece of parchment paper and then spoon our fudge right into the middle of it and once we got it all on there i'm gonna grab a mini loaf pam sit it right down inside and then once it's in there i'm just gonna go in with my fingers and slowly press it down and form it into a square shape i like to do the dab method cause it is a little sticky but if you just do this you're fine and boom that looks pretty good to me now we just fold the paper over it and we're gonna toss this in the freezer for about two hours if you want to eat it right away you could eat it right now but i recommend the freezer at least an hour two's about perfect overnight even depends on how you want to do it but i'm gonna toss it in here now and i'm gonna pull out the one i made earlier today so i take it out of the wrap and i got a big block so i'm just gonna grab a knife and depending on how square you want it you can shave off these edge pieces right here you see now it's much more firm not sticky that consistency we want i mean if it's just you eating it you don't got to do this but i need a good thumbnail and there you have it now we're just going to cut it into squares [Music] and boom ladies and gentlemen i present to you anabolic peanut butter fudge after you cut it up get it nice and square looking i mean heck that looks like fudge to me the difference being that we're actually getting protein here we're not getting all that sugar we're not getting all that fat we can make our food work for us instead of against us and you actually end up with quite a bit of fudge here so what i recommend after you get it cut into pieces if you're eating it right away go to town but if you want to make an even bigger batch or you want to like save half for later toss it in a tupperware container and throw it in the freezer these are best from frozen in my opinion all right ladies and gentlemen i think we've been staring at these long enough smash that thumbs up button for me subscribe if you're not subscribed you know what it is i think it's time to pull up a chair strap on the old feed bag and try these things together you guys ready let's go all right baby it is go time before i dive into this gonna get a little pick-me-up man final boss aminos plus caffeine atomic bombsicle two scoops will fully flavor a gallon this one's got sour moon rock in it though it'd be blue if this was in it so whoop tastes like grandma's cooking available at finalbossperformance.com code rgf10 saves you 10 all right i've had my eye on this big meaty one for a while now we're gonna do this one right here man let's get it three two one here it's rich it's creamy takes a while to eat she's a creamy girl you got that peanut butter flavor when you pull it out of the freezer it's a little colder so it's like dessert i mean come on man incredible that'll take forever to chew you probably require a teeth brushing afterwards not only are these delicious they're going to satisfy that sweet craving and to be honest man i've had three that first piece was big but i've had three and i'm already like full it's like dense it's one of them things right when you're eating regular peanut butter fudge at least how i found myself doing it when you get to like something that's just sugar and fat with no protein it just doesn't fill you up like you can stand there and you can eat and you can eat and that sugar just keeps tasting good and next thing you know you've binged and you've had three thousand four thousand calories in just sugar not good when you don't have the protein there there are no signals being sent to your brain that like wow we're full back off buster you're not getting none of that man so with these anabolic recipes and things like this you get to eat something that tastes amazing but it's sending those signals to your brain you're getting your protein in you're being more anabolic your body's more thermogenics it's got to work to break down that protein unlike something like sugar or fat so i always say the anabolic dye in recipes like this it's like a lifestyle ma'am it ain't about giving up what you love but it's about moderation not binging and eating the entire thing of cookies and when you eat something like this i mean how about three and it's telling me like all right ma'am slow down a bit which is what you want in this entire recipe if you make it exactly how i did it you should end up with a decent amount of bites for the whole thing you have 958 calories only 38 grams of fat 92 grams of protein 62 grams of carbs 12 grams of fiber and like i always preach the only thing that matters is where your calories and your protein are at the end of the day so like for my diet right the amount of calories i need the way i would divvy this up unless i had a ton of calories left over at night is i was put the recipe in half eat half right away and then save the other half for later which is what i'll do with this around 480 calories 46 grams of protein hey man i'm cool with that that would be one of my five meals in a day see i ain't that tricky man we can eat good we just got to get in that kitchen and make the magic happen and if you got that cookbook you are a step ahead of the game man you might have already made this recipe because as i'm formulating them and working on them they hit the cookbook before they ever hit the channel so you get to be

featuring items purchased from Trader Joe's now each Trader Joe's store seems to have their own available selection and some of you may not be fortunate enough to have the alcoholic purchasing available but that's available here so we'll just give a grande spectrum so that everyone stays informed stay tuned today we will be featuring the Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups in a creamy peanut butter covered in dark chocolate now this one is not like the other one it's not an organic dark chocolate mm-hmm but it's here this we purchased this for $4.99 and there and and before we go into our review we will disclose the wheel spacer means so the other ones were blind tastings these we've had before but we're doing it here because we call this the gold standard of chocolate cups from Trader Joe's they are so I mean they're better than Reese's Cups so how do you feel about the packaging we've already opened this package because yeah you can't parody you know what its humble its humble packaging no Brad no frills no frills each one is just like in a little cup yeah that's a nice little it has like the plastic thing and the thing inside are just the thing inside I don't know no I don't remember but it's a it's helpful back it's good colors I think to go with the dark chocolate peanut butter cup it's got the yellow of maroon no frills but I'll say the item speaks for itself so you want to do a little protein sure let's talk about the protein so let's see we're comparing comparing this to the PB&J squares as well as yeah as well as the Sun buttercups this one is in the mid-range here three pieces has three grams of protein so look at that each one has a gram of protein let's see sugar is all dang that's a lot of sugar 18 grams of sugar in each one each one carbs are in three so six grams yeah so I'm not really sure I'm sure some of that is added iron 8% yeah so I guess we could go ahead and give this Smith let's give it a sniff in the packaging first oh you use that nice dark chocolate not the floral dark chocolate just like a nice dark chocolate come back I don't get fruit it smells them just chocolatey no there's something I'm picking up there something I'm picking up the super sniffer maybe just chocolate after all all right you wanna take a cup take a cup so here we have the cute little mini mini cupcake yep yep let's make sure we're not chipping the people because we've tried that right if this was any other one we have the knife it's in the classic peanut butter cup shape I would say it's taller than a Reese's mini Cup you again yes but smaller diameter yeah it is tall though which is coming yeah we're all smooth chocolates are really smooth it on here all right and they're filled all the way up okay peeling back I really like the way these peel ooh already on the bottom though you can tell I've even cut the cross-section yet but you can see the PB coming through all right that is generous on the peanut butter real generous what's interesting is how let's get it they don't eat your peanut butter cups I'm getting so hot I'm gonna eat my even cups all right okay smell Phil oh because you can start to see a letter I can see how hot it is yeah it mean it's like it's really we gotta we gotta get going on this okay all right every night sure is it yeah Cheers ready mm-hmm yeah just as I thought delicious just like I knew crow you like well it's not so creamy like it's the peanut butter has a little bit of Anchorage but nice I kind of like that it's not a crunchy peanut butter it's not that like super smooth like this came from nuts but what happened it's nice it sits on the tongue just long enough because you know you don't like it when you eat something and then the flavor is gone it lingers the perfect amount for you to get just all of it and just get to enjoy it I'm definitely detecting some peanut notes mm-hmm me too notes of dark chocolate some saltiness detecting any tannins mmm tannins no light tannins slide on the tannins guys don't worry oh very good okay so like we said you already know what we rated though yeah those are you anyway I mean ten out of ten for for nut butter cups peanut butter cups chocolate desert realm mm-hmm nice and dense it's not Airy it's not that fluffy like yeah you're like they whip this peanut butter and put it in like they pack it in mm-hmm I think that adds to it everything's very dense and I'm I like dense scissors yeah I think they have their time in their place what I will say I know about punch bowl are very dense I will remind yes they are I will remind you that I'm new to the peanut butter cup world and just in nut butter world and we're in the living I didn't like them before you know your taste buds change they say every seven years so are you gonna change every seven years I don't know buddy we're trustworthy we're trustworthy anyway anyway for somebody that's kind of new to the peanut butter world and still kind of acquiring the the peanut butter taste enjoyment these are fantastic and they're delicious and these were ones that I would buy over and over and over again as we did because this is not our first time buying them yes so especially for the price point yeah I'm dollars for thirty six cups I mean you don't have the packaging like you know Reese's does with a little foil around you can just reach in grab a handful a handful you gotta savor these things too so three probably is like a hand yeah I don't know why you keep getting my name wrong so picking them up at your local Trader Joe's today they're

different back then you know they've been back in the olden days now I think they're they have more like a chewy caramel Center to him they're a little bit chewy but back then they weren't they were really crispy and and wow they were so good I remembered I used to love watching NBA basketball games back then I used to watch dr. Jay Philadelphia 76ers and he was like the the main basketball star back then a little bit later became Magic Johnson Larry Bird 1980s but of course Michael Jordan after that but I used to love to sit back and watch the basketball games and I'd run down to the store and that would buy me four of those watching the college for a dollar and just take him back home to sit there and watch basketball eat my candy bars throughout the day such a good times back then for candy bars for a dollar [Applause] of course you got you Twix bars and and Snickers in the Milky Way so those are all I could eat

time", "PGmiv_ijTo4": "alright it's alright to treat yourself to some candy once in a while so I wanted to compare the Reese's peanut butter cups to the organic version so I'll know it's organic because it's got the USDA stamp on it right there so let's go through the ingredients all the ingredients in the Justin's is organic or none of the ingredients in the Reese's are organic especially the slowly I bet basically the difference between the two of them is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup is a GMO and the Justin's as organic basically they have about the same ingredients the little dots here is what is the similar so what they have the same is milk chocolate peanuts sugar and salt the sugar is different through using evaporated cane sugar in the Justin's try at the regular white sugar I would imagine that's the white salt threes in here and you're using sea salt here in the chocolate though here's the big difference they're using it as emulsifier pgpr or they're not using any almost all they're using the emulsifier here is the soya lecithin but they added this and also there's a preservative TBHQ and the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup there are no preservatives in the Justin's the big difference I see is they add vanilla flavoring in the Justin's where there is no vanilla in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup the other thing on the Justin's there is a vagin choice and that would be the dark chocolate is the vagin one you're using the dark chocolate this one is not vegan so let's actually compare here's the GMO here's the organic one you actually tasted well it's pretty delicious currently taste at peanut butter this one there's no one in hell I'm gonna eat this GMO so get yourself an organic Reese's Peanut Butter Cup the organic version of Reese's is Justin's clipboard in your local supermarket try it and I guarantee you're gonna love it they're delicious you", "_XaIqqSVQ-U": "how could he welcome big cheese review you know I saw I went to my local candy store and I saw these Reese's dark chocolate I never had it before this would be my first time I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate but I hear it's really good for you and I decided why not let's just try these out cost me a dollar 89 a little bit expensive because it's a local candy store it's not like a grocery store which would this would Polly be sent by sans but you know why not just trial now as far as dark chocolate being good for you I that's just something I read I don't know how true that is but I mean everything in moderation you know long as everything's that and embarrassing for fine okay well it looks a lot darker than a regular Reese's obviously dark chocolate it actually smells pretty good just give this a bite well I'll tell you this that's some good dark chocolate you know dark chocolate I have it's a little too strong for me it's not sweet enough this almost tastes like a milk chocolate Reese's peanut butter cups I really do enjoy this one now I don't if I like it better than the original it does have that small dark chocolate taste to it but it's very small and it's it's not I mean I think if you love dark chocolate you're probably at this point in this candy the reason being it really doesn't taste like really real good dark chocolate you want to give a taste yeah definitely my wife my wife loves our chocolate anytime we think okay she doesn't like it like I said it's almost like no chocolate my wife loves dark chocolate she's not a big fan of milk chocolate she doesn't like this so I like it and I don't like dark chocolate so there it is that's basically it in a nutshell now what I think about this product I think I still like a milk chocolate a bit better but this is not a bad alternative so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give the naked eye think I really do like it and you know oh let me see that real quick okay okay like oh hi wife God the minute she got that she pull this out okay well anyways thank you so much for watching if you have any comments or requests please them in the comment section", "RNYHBSA4XAk": "- What up, it's your boy, Josh, AKA Big Beef, AKA Seleno and\nBarnes: Injury Attorneys, AKA 2008 JV Basketball\nMost Improved Player. And it's that time again. Time to take two snacks\nand smash them together into one delicious snack, baby. And this time, I've enlisted\nthe help of Nicole and Trevor to help me bring those\nbeautiful snack babies to life. We asked you which two snacks\nyou wanted to see smashed and you picked Doritos and\nReese's Peanut Butter Cups. Will this snack be a smash? Find out 'cause this is Snack Smash. (energetic rock music) A couple ways we could go with this. I think what we need to do, make unflavored Doritos from scratch. So you make just like the base chip-- (crunch) Oh, they're so good. - They're real good, yeah. (laughing) - We need to take the\nReese's Peanut Butter Cups and turn that into the flavor powder. We'd have to make one peanut\nbutter and one chocolate, do it Reese's Puffs style. Or we could a toss up\nbetween different flavors. - I think we should do two. - Do two? - I thin it'd be cool if we did two. - As far as the Doritos go, corn and vegetable oil are\nthe only two things listed. Everything else on here is curry cheese, MSG, Romano cheese, they were\nusing Romano cheese in this? - Ray Romano!\n- That's a fun-- (laughing) Oh my God, they got my cheese in here. - Who's Ray Romano? - God, Trevor's too young! I think we should use maseca, the stuff you make tortillas from. - Oh yeah! - And then to get a little\nbit of that corn flavor and crunch in there,\nI think we should just use like whole cornmeal. The flavoring on this, you wanna hit it with old\nmaltodextrin razzle dazzle? - I would love to. - I think we should try and\ntake the actual Reese's Cup and then dissect it\ninto two different parts and then use maltodextrin\nto powder those separately, and then use that as a\ndusting for our chips. - But who's gonna do that? Nose goes! (laughs) - Trevor, you got the steadiest\nhands of all of us, man. You're gonna separate the peanut\nfrom the chocolate in that. Nicole, you're gonna hit him with old maltodextrin razzle dazzle. And then I'm gonna make the Doritos and do the handshake\nthat we all practiced! (grunts) - Okay. (whoosh) - I don't think the\nmallet's gonna be useful. So what I'm doing is I'm taking\neach individual Reese's Cup and I'm extracting the peanut\nbutter from the chocolate as precisely as I can,\nusing a paring knife, exacto knife, and a very\nsmall offset spatula. So I'm just gonna separate, you know? As much of this peanut butter\noff of the chocolate as I can, and gloves are important\nbecause I don't want chocolate and peanut butter all over my hands. And I'm not like Josh, I don't like my hands to\nbe dirty all the time. I'm not a disgusting person. (laughing) Glad I went to culinary school, you know? 'Cause all those tools and techniques that I learned then are\nreally helping me now. My dream job, when I decided\nto go to culinary school was a personal baker for LeBron James. That was number one, and then\nsomewhere in my subconscious, this was number two for sure. I'm so talented. (laughs) Look at me. (whoosh) - Okay, I'm gonna make\nsome powders. (claps) So, Trevor went ahead and\ndissected these beautifully. And then I took the chocolates and then I just melted\nthem in a microwave, just making it nice and melted, so when I put in the maltodextrin powder, it won't be such a stark difference of like when I'm combining it. Maltodextrin powder is this chemical that's from tapioca, I believe. You add it to whatever\nproduct you're working with and it evaporates all of the fat. So, if I were to make\nlike an olive oil dust, I would just take straight olive oil, pour it into like a huge\nvat of maltodextrin, and then I'd have like\nthese really cool chunks of olive oil flavored powder. So I'm just gonna fold it over it and I'm just gonna crush this in here. I make a lot of Narcos jokes 'cause of all the white powders I'm using. A little bit of corn starch and a little bit of powdered sugar. And I'm gonna mix 'em all together. And I like to do this by hand\nversus in a food processor because I get to control it and I like to be in control\nall the time, always. I'll try this. That's good, perfect. So I'm gonna repeat the same\nprocess with my peanut butter. So, Josh has no measuring style. I used to be a very precise,\naccurate young woman. I would care about quarter teaspoons and eighths of teaspoons. No, no, not anymore. Working in the Mythical\nKitchen has changed me in ways I would've never expected. I am more careless. Just gonna kinda use my hands\na little bit to rub it in. There we go. I just kind of move with the flow. That looks like peanut\nbutter powder, right? But okay, cool, that's\ngood, lemme try this. Oh! That's perfect. I'm a little bit worried that the chips might be like too intense of a flavor because once the chocolate kind of oxidize after it was hanging out\nwith the maltodextrin, it was like really, really dark, and I was worried that like, ugh, it might be like too\nchocolatey or too bitter, but I don't know. I'm like hoping for the best. And then I'm just gonna\nput it through this Tammy! Her name is Tammy. It is actually called called Tammy-2. I'm just gonna kinda shake it out, create a really fine, beautiful powder. I'm also gonna do this like a few times 'cause I don't wanna cake\nup my Tammy, you know? When I mean caking up my Tammy, I mean cakin' up my Tammy. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Yeah, no, okay, sorry. (laughing) 'Kay, now I'm gonna do my peanut butter. I have a really good feeling about how this is going to turn out. It's probably gonna be\nreally salty and really sweet and it's gonna be like\na delicious amalgamation of two really, really\npolar opposite snacks. So, my fingers are crossed,\nI'm hoping for the best. Wow! That looks awesome. (whoosh) - I know what you're thinking, Josh, what the H-E-double-toothpicks, a Dorito is just a fried tortilla chip, why do you have all these\ningredients out here, why did aren't you just\nfryin' up tortillas? They're actually not,\nthey're a fried corn product made with raw corn materials, that's exactly what we're gonna do. (crunch) I can't have a Dorito\nin my hand and not eat it. So, to make the Doritos, first we have to start with the dough. We're using a mixture of maseca, which is corn that's been treated with lye and then dried in ground. For the first time ever, I've\ndecided to measure something, this is a big moment. Please clap, please clap, I'm-- (clapping) Jeb Bush 2020! He's not runnin', but he's comin', baby! I'm gonna mix the maseca\nwith the cornmeal. That's about a half-cup. That's kind of a measurement, I mean, I used a bigger measurement to make a smaller measurement. And then we're gonna add water and a little bit of baking powder just to kinda get a little bit of rise and get like an extra crispy crunch. I don't even know how to\nuse these things, man. Got a half-teaspoon and now, we just need to mix this up with a fork. Doritos have these little\nmicro-bubbles in them that gives them this extra crispy texture that makes 'em different from,\nsay, a normal tortilla chip. So I'm putting baking powder in there. That way, when it gets in the heat, you're gonna get little\nchemical reactions, carbon dioxide bubbles, and that should give you\na extra Dorito crunch. Notice I'm not using my hands, I have evolved as a person. I'm just adding water in there and then you should\nmix this up with a fork until it becomes a nice,\npliable dough-rito! Dough?\n- Ooh. - No, yeah, it wasn't great. Here we go, now the dough\nis feeling nice and pliable. And I'm rolling that out in\nbetween two silicone mats so nothing sticks together. Bam, food lube, very\nimportant in the kitchen. And let's see if it works. (grunts) Mash it out with\nyour hands a little bit. Put this over. And you wanna get it super, super thin, but not too thin, you don't want it to be like translucently thin. Now, if we've lubed up enough, they should be able to just\nslide right past each other. Let's see. Yes? Yes! God, I'm good at this! Okay. I'm using a Dorito mold\nthat Mike Paisley made me because he's very talented. And then I'm punching out the Doritos. This is the arts and\ncrafts portion of the day, just like my grandma does\nin her retirement home. I once made my grandma a apron\nin Home Ec in seventh grade, and she still uses it, but\nmy brother made her one and it was green, and she threw it out 'cause that color is cursed in my family. That's real. Very cleanly. Hah, look at that! Got a nice little Dorito chip. See, it's pretty thin, but not too thin. And what we do is I'm gonna take this, I'm gonna put it in the oil, and real key here is to agitate the oil. You can agitate a chip in many ways. The first is attacking its masculinity. There we go, and we have the\noil at about 315 degrees, we don't want it to be too hot because then you're gonna get\ntoo much browning on the chip. You can agitate a Josh in many ways. The easiest is to attack its masculinity. Yeah, look at that, you can\nalready see him forming. You agitate a Ben by basically\ndoing any of the things that I do on set on a daily basis. So check this out, you see\nsome of those micro-bubbles that we talked about, that are formed. Let's just flip open\nthat burning hot chip. Ow. I'm gonna put it in there a little bit, see if I can get a little\nmore agitation on there, and then we're frying\nthe chips individually because I am an incredibly\nprecise cook, as you all know. So, I don't know, come back\nin like, what, six hours? A little lunch break? I've had to pee this whole time. (whoosh) Welcome to the Dorito Network, I'm Josh and you're watchin' Doritos. Okay, so we got our chips all made. And it's all been individually fried, see those awesome air bubbles. And you got your powders. So what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna drop the chips in the oil very briefly, and then I'm gonna take them out with this and I'm gonna throw 'em into the bowl, and then you're gonna toss them. And the CostCo truck\nneeds to shut the H up! (beep)\nCountdown from 10. - [Nicole And Trevor]\n10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four--\n- Mississippi-- - Three, two--\n- Mississippi, Mississippi-- - One--\n- Mississippi-- Well, go! - [Trevor] We're doing 10! - Oh, that was it?\n- 10! - Oh God, I lost the\nchip, I lost the chip, okay, okay, go, go,\ntoss, toss, toss, Trevor. - It's hot, it's hot, it's hot-- - Yeah, no, toss with your hands, to like use the bowl to flip!\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, there it is, okay. Trevor, they're comin'\nyour way soon, buddy. You gotta be ready, gotta be ready, get your hands up, kid! - They're sticking together! - I'm not catchin' it with my hands! - Toss it, toss it faster, my God! - Go, go, go! - What do I have to do to motivate you? Go.\n- Ooh. - Toss. How do I reach these kids? Whoa, I hit puberty in real time! That is fantastic, I felt\nsomething in my pants drop. (laughing) - Oh my God, these are too hot! - Well, yeah, no, you gotta (blowing). - There's so much powder! - Josh, you--\n- That's how you blow on it! - You're an unsanitary man.\n- Oh God. Let's try this, why don't we go? - Do see this? - Oh, you mean like when\nthe corn I said to do? - Pam, now try it. - Oh, why look at that,\nperfectly-dusted Dorito. - Does the Pam work? - Yeah. - That's great, don't you love that? - When you fail, it gives\nyou an opportunity to learn. - Pam my chips, dog! Come on.\n- And if you succeed, then you don't have the\nopportunity is the real failure, and success--\n- You'll get there. - Is the trophy.\n- Yeah, now go? You got it.\n- Can you Pam the chips? - I got it. We should just Pam down the whole floor and turn this place into\na freakin' Slip 'n Slide. - Ooh! - These look like chocolate\nand peanut butter Doritos. I really like what's happening here. - Nicole, if we did a high-five, it would be a Reese's high-five. - Yeah, let's do it. Ready?\n- Yeah. (claps) - And Josh wants to be included! (laughing) All right, guys, we spent so much time making these beautiful Doritos. But what makes you want to eat Doritos? - Doritos? - No! The bag. (upbeat rock music) All right, guys, now we gotta taste these. We put in all that hard work. This is the moment of truth. - I'm so excited. (sniffs) - Oh, give that a huff. - (sniffs) Ooh. - (sniffs) Oh my gosh.\n- Ooh yeah. - Grab a handful. - That's distinct. - These, they're a little\ncakey, which makes me excited. But we still got the distinct two layers, they're kinda bleedin' into\neach other a little bit. I think we should celebrate\nby gingerly touching our tips. (snorts)\nAll right. (crunching) They're crunchy like a Dorito.\n- Mmhmm! - The chip's on point. And my mouth does not know what\nit's experiencing right now. - Mine either. - Wait, why do you guys\nseem so apprehensive? - I'm trying to think. - I'm confused, my mouth is\nconfused by what's going on. - It's an explosion of flavor. - Mm, my mind is tellin' me yeah, but my body is also tellin' me yeah. (laughing) It does taste like the perfect\nmarriage between the two. - Did you put salt in the chips at all? - No. - It's like perfectly salty. - Coming from the peanut butter, 'cause the peanut butter in\nReese's in a little bit salty. - Yeah, it's like the\nperfect amount of like salt to compliment like a\nbuttload of sweet, you know? - There's a buttload of sweet,\nwe put the butt in ourselves. - Yeah, I extracted the butt\ndirectly from the Reese's. - Mmhmm, you did. - So yeah, the crunch in the Dorito, it's got like that perfect\nlittle airy crispiness, get a little bit of salt\nfrom the peanut butter, and when you combine the two, like, you get the exact essence\nof a Reese's in your mouth. - And you get dust on your fingers-- - Your Dorito fingers! - We got Reese's Dorito fingers! - You got a snack for later. - Hey guys, so we have our official Smash or Pass paddles here. And we're gonna vote on this snack on a three, two, one, go, you guys ready? - Yes! - All right. Three, two, one, go! (bell dinging) We're all smashin' this snack! - Whoo! - Yeah, this is absolutely incredible, like, you get the savory\nand sweet from it. It's super addicting, you\ncould keep eating it all day, these Reese's Doritos absolutely smash. - I agree! - These need to be on shelves. - But guys, is it about\nthe Reese's Doritos? Or is it about the friendships\nwe made along the way? - Thank you guys so much for watching, keep a lookout, next Tuesday, we got another episode of Snack Smash, and we got more recipe\nvideos coming your way. Also a really big surprise coming out tomorrow on Mythical Kitchen. Thanks for stoppin' by and\nI'll see you next time. Get as messy as you want in your kitchen when you have the Mythical kitchen towel. Available now as Mythical.com.", "aR9DBLMPKeY": "I don't know about you but i absolutely love peanut butter caps i've loved them all boy since i was a kid and I love them right up until this day but peanut butter cups don't really match with eating clean and getting healthy so what I did is I decided to make my own variety of raw chocolate peanut butter cups so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to make ourselves some raw chocolate how do we do that we mix these two ingredients together so this is coconut butter and raw cacao powder now copy that butter might be a little bit difficult for you to find you can also use coconut oil I actually prefer the taste of the coconut butter with my raw chocolate so that's why off for this one the rock cow powder is very very high in nutrients it's amazing with antioxidant and kids love this recipe so I'm going to pop these two things into my pot here and actually I've had some chocolate boiling on the stove here on my double boilers you can see that you can see that it's beautiful dark chocolate texture so this is completely unsmooth you can't taste any sugar there's no sugar in at all it's just coconut butter and raw cacao powder melts it on a double boiler if you want to sweeten the chocolate I like to use a vanilla cream stevia so stevia is a very healthy sweet area doesn't affect your blood sugar levels at all and I like the vanilla cream because it tastes fantastic with me nut butter so I'm going to put a couple of drops of this in again it depends on who you're feeding if you're getting kids they like to have a little bit sweeter so you can adjust the CVL levels to your desires and needs so there's a couple drops of the vanilla cream stevia so the first step here is after boiling the chocolate here what we're going to do is we're going to take a muffin shrimp tin so I like to use something like this that's quite small and you can line it with muffin cups if you wish up or you can just pour it straight back in so what I like to do is just fill it about half way and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop this in the freezer for about five to seven minutes that's all the chocolate is set so I just pop these out of the freezer as you can see they're rock solid and the chocolate is just about halfway so what we're going to do now is we're going to put the peanut butter on top of the half layer of chocolate now further moms that are making these for kids as you know a lot of kids have peanut allergies so you can choose to use other nut butters like almond butter cashew butter he's a lot better experiments if you would like to keep this recipe completely raw you can also opt for coconut butter so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my chunky peanut butter here which is the one I love and I'm going to pop it right into the middle of my chocolate and I'll do that again here see that and then I'm going to do is I'm going to take the rest of the chocolate that I had found it and I'm going to just pour it right over top of peanut butter so make sure that it gets to the edges and try to keep the peanut butter if you can in the middle so that it can be covered pletely with the melted chocolates again these are this is a raw recipe because the chocolate is not cooked higher than 120 degrees so it's very very healthy very nutrient rich amazing for antioxidants and what I like to do is I I'd love to have something sweet after dinner so I like to make a couple of these are like a muffin tray of these and after dinner I might pop one or two if I feel like having something sweet and healthy so as you can see this is what we've done here so you've got your first layer of chocolate you've got your second layer which is just peanut butter right in the middle and then you'd put your third layer which is melted chocolate right over top so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this back in the freezer for another five minutes and then we're going to see what it looks like so I just pop these right out of the freezer out of the little muffin tray and what they look like aren't they absolutely gorgeous so I love these peanut butter cups they're one of my favorite favorite recipes clean recipes again they're super easy to make it took me less than 10 minutes to make so if you're having a chocolate craving don't reach for those artificial post as peanut butter cups just turn away get your coconut butter get your cocoa powder and make your own these are great for kids they're great time after dinner and my website for some more information there for some awesome recipes thank you you", "UfWyK0UftRY": "[Applause] well hello everyone peanut butter cup and I went up the stairs and I was really excited and when I went in his Williams he had a

"V8CHY4a3a_4": "everybody this video Bob and this is a really weird video so I have had this in my freezer for right about 10 years now it's a little back history which you'll read in the comments this is an Elvis Reese's big cup it's peanut butter and banana cream so they made these around 2006-2007 and I think they were sensation but they were very limited edition now I'm a big Elvis fan people who know me know that I'm a big Elvis fan have an entire Elvis room at my house I have a TCB tattooed on my wrist taking care of business in a flash and when I saw these I had to have matter of fact the truth is I bought an entire case of these and I ate every single one of them except this one I said you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna save this one for later and I put it in the freezer in that little shelf in the freezer and I kept it in there for a while next thing you know it's like ten years later I put this in and actually it was like 2009 or 2010 I actually put it in the freezer I don't know if it has a date code on it but I know that they quit making them I want to say in 2007 or 2008 I'm so little foggy on that so the truth is when I bought these they were actually already old because I bought them from a discount store it was like Big Lots for a dollar store it was one of those kind of stores that gets rid of stuff like this that maybe people didn't like maybe where other people weren't into peanut butter and banana but this was something that Elvis liked this is a southern thing I know my mom used to make me peanut butter banana sandwiches when I was a kid the real trick is put a little honey on it so this has been in my fridge frozen for like eight years and I'm gonna eat the sumbitch now I was planning on eating it for my birthday party yesterday but I got so up I forgot so I'm gonna do it now and I thought this is way more fun I'm gonna do it on the video but I gotta admit I'm a little apprehensive and I I've been saving this thing for a long time but here's the milestone Elvis died at age 42 when I was a little baby I'm 43 now I've outlived Elvis Wow my I'm smelling this peanut butter and banana oh darn I didn't want to rip the package that way I'm trying to save it so let's carefully dissected I've already to do it very carefully all right there we go they they have some some cracking a little bit of cracking there you can see in the light but they're not moldy or anything I've let them thaw still smells smells like a rhesus this is the moment of truth I mean you know I can't be faking this because if you look this up you'll find that they haven't made these in 10 years 10 year-old Reese's Peanut Butter Cup here we go it's a little dry just a little bit dry but um it's actually really good I don't know what does that say about racism is that a good thing or a bad thing that is delicious why aren't they still making this I'm eating a ten-year-old Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and it's awesome hmm that is really good the banana really come through let's see let's see what the everybody knows I do low-carb I don't need a lot of candy and sugar and stuff so I'm probably gonna need an insulin shot Wow 43 carbs holy I wonder if there's any actual banana in it milk chocolate nonfat milk peanuts nonfat milk away banana flakes Wow made with real banana I'm gonna have to eat the other one I'm gonna have to do it no turning back now well here's to you Elvis Elvis Aaron Presley never got to meet you never got to see alive but your big inspiration to me I love you and outlive you by a year and now I'm eating your goddamn peanut butter cup mmm Lubin era Risa's why aren't you making this this is we need more banana peanut butter cups I'd venture to say that if you made just a banana one without the peanut butter it'd still be awesome the banana is really a different it's like a whole different but some are not used to getting in candy you know look at the big level though the layer of sediment of banana I'm still really good I'm eating a 10 year old candy bar when it's awesome my god the preservatives that are in this thing to be fair it was kept in his freezer at like below you know freezing I mean it was solid as a rock I wish I hadn't torn this I was gonna try to salvage just label believe it or not I could probably sell just this wrapper on eBay for like 20 bucks now I've torn it so I guess I'll just throw it out but anyway it was it was it was good I've been saving this gosh darn thing in my freezer for almost 10 years and I just kept thinking well I'll save it for a special occasion and this year was the 40th anniversary of Elvis's death and I thought you know in celebration of his life and the fact that I've outlived him I've now 43 I'll enjoy this Reese's big cup so my plea to resis please bring back the Elvis edition banana peanut butter cup these are really good everybody but make sure to subscribe to all of my videos I've got almost 90,000 subscribers and maybe you'll be the one to top it

so as always I'm always bringing you guys something new whether if it's about me myself and personal or whether if it's about a product that I love our product that I want to feature onto my beaver Brown live channel but I also like to bring it as an experience but you can not only feel happy and confident and you know good about yourself in that moment but you can also feel as though you can try this and you can also convert it from you know a certain diet that may not be as healthy for you but you can still have the sweetness of a flavor or the sweetness of a candy without having to pass the Snickers Isle and the recess aisles pass it straight like a test no you can still have the best of both worlds so that's what I wanted to you I did some digging and that's why I wanted to bring you guys a company that I know that you love and a company that I know that can offer you what you deserve out of a healthy and sweet snack so let's get into so today I'm gonna be featuring the unreal dark chocolate peanut butter cup as well as the chunk as well to crunchy dark chocolate peanut butter cups so it's a crunchy ones it has a semi crunch to it so I love the both of them this is the unreal packaging but enough of that let's get into the chocolate this is the crunchy dark chocolate peanut butter this is a Reese's Cup this is not really a Reese's Cup but this is a natural alternative to resist so even though it may seem like it's you know oh snap this ain't racist but it's unreal you would never know that it's not Lisa's when you try this especially the original peanut butter cup the dark chocolate dark chocolate so it's healthy and you want food or so it's you know gonna bother you and it's gluten free and it's non-gmo it's free trade ingredients 100% vegan certified vegan 5 grams of sugar nothing unofficial under real taste and it's perfect because you can actually indulge without feeling as though oh my goodness I feel sugar rising feeling under the treadmill no it's not gonna make you feel that way so let's save here a gym rat and you're someone who likes to work out a lot but you also want to put in good stuff without feeling as though you're putting in bad stuff this unreal company is perfect for you because I love that they have that they have peanut butter cups that looks just like Reese's but it of course it tastes different but it has that same sweetness that you want and have that same flavor combinations that you want out of chocolate and peanut butter and they even have other candies you know they have candies that looks like M&Ms they have other sweets but are hunters and vegans but you would never know based on what you see so it's perfect and I love that it makes you not feel so guilty when it comes to indulging but enough of my rambling and I'm actually going to try this right now and I will be featuring photos of each product in the corner so don't forget to keep an eye out for those so instead of trying to crunch you in I'm gonna try the peanut butter one right here now one of them in the peanut butter one is that it's filled to be I don't have to worry about any dairy and saying the can you feel clogged or like clump or feel as though I need to take some medication yeah so this right here is the dark chocolate peanut butter and this is what it looks like it looks like a reason to cut doesn't it kneeling this is just like a Reese's Cup except of course the rhesus has a packaging around it so let's get into it now let me just my first I'm smelling the dark chocolate Monu I gave us I'll let my three siblings try it two out of three our major candy eaters especially chocolate my sister loved this she loves another chocolate peanut her because if she doesn't like it she would tell me like instantly my girder this ain't in to attack me and my brother he loves love's love's loves chocolate especially M&Ms or rhesus or Babe Ruth or Three Musketeers so he definitely love this one I gave him you know three of this and it was gone within minutes and this is how it looks as well as an inside that's the S the peanut butter inside of it and that's the chocolate and there's an elated just great so now that I've tried the peanut butter but a perfumer let's try the crunchy peanut butter the crunchy just what we're trying pardon my ripping on the wrapper like an animal but this is the dark chocolate peanut butter it looks the same doesn't it it has a racist look to it but it's definitely different than this one has a crunch to it versus the peanut butter the dark chocolate peanut butter one so this is the crunchy dark chocolate peanut butter 1 mm crunch to it so you can see it I'm at a house like that like a cookie or am let's see what's crunch cooking type of crunch to it I love this one actually actually picked up this broom in my local Kroger so if you haven't like to purchase this frame don't forget to visit your local Kroger or you can purchase the products online

the quest peanut butter cups i never even seen this advertised i got this at vitamin shop so this is for two cups it's 190 calories it's 15 grams of fat um let's see here [Music] it's only one net carb and it's 11 grams of protein for two let's see i'm gonna try one it's a really cute look it's not just like a peanut butter cup like a reese's it's pretty good the only difference is the peanut butter is not as sweet obviously the candy but that's pretty comparable um no protein taste at all it's peanut butter and chocolate this is that's a really great find i think they were 2.49 so this is a fun version of replacing a reese's cup i just don't know why quest is not made these a big deal i think that's pretty freaking cool hey thumbs up for me", "pIhT27traw8": "all right i'm feeling this comment because i don't have any like sweets in my house right now so we need these you need these let's go line a muffin tray you need two cups of lily semi-sweet chips but start with one cup and one tablespoon of coconut oil you're going to repeat this step at the end keep it on low and keep stirring now pour equal amounts into each cup put these in the freezer while we do step two now in a saucepan put a quarter cup of natural peanut butter two tablespoons of powdered stevia this is my favorite two teaspoons of almond flour and a quarter teaspoon vanilla extract now melt this all together i hate waiting for things to freeze now add your peanut butter go back in the freezer once that's frozen repeat step one with the chocolate now just repeat back in the freezer", "Y3TvKPI06KA": "this is stephanie manley with copykat.com I'm gonna show you how you can make peanut butter ice cream and I'm throwing in some unreal peanut butter cups into this you know why not have a double dose of peanut butter now this recipe contains two cups of heavy cream heavy cream equals whipping cream equals industrial cream this is the full fat heavy cream then I'm using a cup of half-and-half half and half is half cream and half whole milk if you can't already buy it in the store 3/4 cup of sugar goes in this and a teaspoon of vanilla and of course we still have the peanut butter I'm using about 1/3 cup of peanut butter in this recipe so you're gonna end and the peanut butter cups I'm using the equivalent of four peanut butter cups I really like this unreal brand because there's no GMOs no fillers it's candy without all the junk how cool is that all right we're gonna mix up our ice-cream base and that is our two cups of heavy cream we're going to add our 3/4 cup of sugar and we're gonna add our 1 cup of half-and-half and our vanilla and we're just gonna give this a stir and that's all the Third's in the base right now we'll be adding in the peanut butter and the peanut butter cups a little later you're just gonna give this a quick little stir and then we're gonna pour this into ice cream makers now I have an electric model one so I'll I have to do is plug this thing in and in about an hour I have ice cream I love it this is a one quart model I believe the machine is called a winter model and I bought it on amazon.com so I poured in my ice cream and at this point you probably need to follow the directions on your machine but let me show you just turn it on put the lid on and I'm gonna come back when it's halfway done and now it's halfway to you can see is starting to freeze and now I'm adding in the peanut butter why am i doing it now I love the little chunks and bits of frozen peanut butter that you get and many types of ice cream Baskin Robbins has his flavor and it's fantastic it's chocolate peanut butter and this will help leave some of the bits of peanut butter in little bits and chunks I'm using smooth peanut butter you could use chunky and that's it and now I'm gonna wait another 15 20 minutes the ice cream is almost done at this point you can see it's wonderful it's got a great texture another reason why I love this machine because that what's in the right amount of air and it makes like a premium quality ice cream now I'm gonna add in a four peanut butter cups to this and I'm gonna go ahead and let the machine do the work it will go ahead and drag the chunked up peanut butter cups all the way through the ice cream and it's gonna be fabulous I wanted to do this ice cream because I wanted to make something that was completely organic and you know what I got it by making homemade ice cream I would hate to think about how much organic ice cream would cost and best of all I can do it with candy

going to show you how to make incredible rhesus eggs now they're not the traditional kind of rhesus expert you get them at the store and they contain like 20 grams of sugar these are the recent eggs that are green free dairy free and gluten free and only made with a touch of maple syrup they're absolutely delicious and I can't wait for you to try them and you especially grapefruity let's get started all right so we've got creamy natural peanut butter today you could also use a crunchy nut or peanut butter it now all we need is a little touch of maple syrup I'm not getting you that's the only sugar in this recipe so this is to sweeten it you could also use honey and I wouldn't recommend anything else because it needs a liquid sweetener next we're going to add a tablespoon of coconut bar and then we'll stir it see what it looks like and it might give a little bit more and if so we'll add it so I'm looking at it and it looks like it could use another tube now I'm not adding any salt to the recipe because it's peanut butter is already salted but if you use peanut butter that's not salted yet you might want to add a pinch of now we're gonna scoop it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and we'll stick to the freezer for 20 minutes [Music] [Music] okay so jet pulled these out of the freezer they look phenomenal and I'm gonna try one little treat oh my god this is so that looks like an actual Reese's egg creamy peanut butter low carb low sugar high protein my friend Vicki hope you love them see you later", "ywQrcwc-lRE": "[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do

are making reese's peanut butter cup cookies okay so we're gonna start off by melting two sticks of butter and when we melt it we're gonna continue to cook it after it's melted until it turns brown because once it turns brown it has this incredible nutty flavor once you're done cooking the butter place it into a bowl and let it come to room temperature [Music] in a bowl place your brown butter your peanut butter and your sugars [Music] cream those together until they're really really well combined [Music] crack in two eggs and don't forget a little dash of vanilla once thoroughly combined set that mixture aside and then place the flour baking soda and salt into a bowl and then give it a really good whisk [Music] mix together the dry and wet ingredients and stir until the dough forms [Music] stir in a cup of chocolate chips next i take about a cup of reese's peanut butter cups which is of course the star of the show in reese's cookies and chop them up into about fourths then i fold those reeses peanut butter cups into the dough and portion out my dough bowls [Music] my trick on making the reese's flavor stand out in these cookies is to put an entire mini cup in the center of each cookie [Music] then i let these chill in the freezer for about 30 minutes and bake them at 350 for about 10 to 15 minutes and here's some of the best cookies that you'll ever try these are actually so good and they're so fun to make", "MmNQCi1EfOs": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel welcome back to my kitchen got a couple big announcements the first one as of yesterday i am officially a texas homeowner hold the applause bud we ain't seen how the lighting is in that kitchen yet it could have been off or not second announcement as i woke up today new low weight check me out man how we looking bud from being real i've never had a diet easier and better than this one real soft in today's video guys we're gonna be making a delicious delicacy how many people out there have had a peanut butter chew to be honest this is literally one of my favorite cookie dessert snack things but the only time i ever found them was at thanksgiving and at christmas you know how it is whole family gets together there's that one plate of like a million different types of cookies and to be honest that's where i'd post up because every holiday is a cheat day all the other guys are standing around the bar drinking beers reminiscing about the cold war me i'm posted up by that cookie tray hoping no one's paying attention to how many i've really eaten for real though peanut butter chews excellent the only problem is is how they're made peanut butter lots of sugar corn syrup which is just more sugar and did i mention peanut butter 200 calories for a spoon of it so today man we're gonna take that recipe lock all that flavor and all that deliciousness make it anabolic and put the rjf spin on it that way we don't have to feel guilty after eating these treats and we can still make games baby in today's video man we are making anabolic peanut butter chews creamy and delicious with a nice coat of shine to them these things are going to be a hit at your next party every single bite is gooey loaded with flavor anabolic and sure to make every head in the room spin like the extra sip seriously man not only is this recipe stupid simple anybody can do it once you're done you've got a plate of baked goods that you don't gotta feel bad about eating and to be honest that's probably the biggest victory of them all as always man if you have the rgf recipe book link in description it's been updated this recipe is now in there along with every other one of my anabolic recipes are you trying to find a diet that is sustainable one where you can eat whatever you want only caveat is that you got to get in the kitchen and make it yourself man as long as you're cool with that i really feel like this could change your life it changed my life i mean you guys see it every single video on my instagram i'm showing you guys what i'm doing the same rocket science people he's got to put a little bit of work in all the recipes and you're golden you get it one time you get every future recipe update for free man we're over 100 pages now boy and by the end of this thing we're gonna have 200 so if you guys are ready to get another epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] just like how many a delicious evening begins you're gonna need a food scale and a mixing bowl and the first ingredient we were going to need is 80 grams of pb fit powder you can really use any powdered peanut butter brand you want bud they're all gonna be just about the same the benefits of using this over regular peanut butter we save on calories bud we get extra protein and extra fiber we get all the good stuff in the peanut butter with all the fatty oil in my book man the less fat the better next up we just need 130 grams of unsweetened vanilla almond milk be super careful with this measurement guys if you use too much of this it won't reconstitute how we want it man you got to get that measurement right on the money just like that next up we need 42 grams of sugar-free imitation honey this is going to give these a lot of flavor without adding any sugar it's gonna make them real shiny at the end but the prettier the food is the more likely people are to eat it show up with a peanut butter chew that looks like a scooby snack they're gonna turn you down every time now we just need 31 grams of a vanilla based whey protein powder i'm using that final boss as usual as the time you're watching this this stuff is actually in stock but i'm filming this video in advance so you might be out of luck but i don't know what to tell you maybe follow me on instagram so you get the updates i don't know and the final ingredient we add in here is 10 grams of zero calorie sweetener if you're still against this stuff guys i don't know what to tell you i've literally never seen a bad side effect from this except for in college some of the guys a few dorms down reading a lot of artificial sugars and next thing you know the entire building was like that mutant academy from x-men let's just say some people developed some strange abilities [Music] now at this point all we gotta do is go in with a spoon and start stirring everything up for real man don't even try this batter because you might not even get to the cookie making part you might just eat this i am speaking from a place of experience all right fine i'll try the batter don't twist my arm get in there alone i feel like the pillsbury doughboy they got tickled [Music] once our peanut butter concoction is mixed up we're gonna tag in a saucepan hit it with some nonstick and then slowly pour our peanut butter down in here [Music] so we got the peanut butter in the saucepan we're gonna get that out the way for now and we cleaned out our mixing bowl because we are going to measure out 40 grams of kellogg's corn flakes and put them in our mixing bowl the only reason i'm using name brand corn flakes because the cheap ones were sold out don't think i'm trying to flex on you bud this was my only option bottoms up yeah buddy all right guys we are almost done so i'm going to show you how the rest of this is going to go down take your saucepan full of nut butter set it right on your stove set it to a medium heat and i mean medium not medium high not volcano medium like the size of shirts i wear just kidding i'm gonna large and then all we're gonna do as it heats up is slowly stir it if you look now it's been on the heat for a little bit and it's already thickened up just stick with it keep stirring it this is only gonna take like two to three minutes it's gonna heat up and it's gonna be just how we want it baby [Music] and once it's thickened up quite a bit we're gonna take it off the stove and we're gonna pour it right over top of our corn flakes now i'm just going to go with a spoon and mix everything up if you made it this far into the video guys smash that thumbs up button man we're making magic happen in this kitchen [Music] and once our peanut butter chew mixture is fully mixed up i just grabbed two tupperware containers and i'm just gonna use my spoon and put them into little bites and just sip these down in here into little portions you can make these any size you want man i just like tupperware containers to let you split it into servings man i can split the recipe in half half half now half half later

to say 40% cocoa and no sugar added let's check this out first of all we gotta start off with the packaging this packaging looks like the Reese's packaging but the orange is a little bit more ashy ER but I see where you're going with this I dig lily I like Lily so if you ain't familiar with the brand Lily's they make alternative they make chocolate bar and they make it with sugar good for keto or paleo diets you know I'm talking bite for real for real but we gonna get back to this review let's check out the calories let's check the unboxing experience I might have to stop the video so I can edit it matter of fact I'm gonna open the night I don't like editing I like talking all the way through anyway I'm back so I unbox it looks like that's the ankle whoa why is it scratched up did Wolverine get to the dango Kubica or is that a design I don't know what that is let's check that out we need to evaluate the food mmm cloth war if you look like a design so I'm gonna tell you how this peanut butter cupcakes and gave you my pain y'all want to see me eat it everybody burn so let's try this peanut butter cup I'm gonna do it on my next clip this one if you started off like a little bit dry or hard but damn make I saw like a real peanut butter cup you got like creamy look at the inside detail can I flip the cameras oh so you see that see that look at that detail right there amazing lilies definitely did they thing with these these are good this right here this right here I'm gonna smack your granny with these I'm gonna finish this the fool Reese's Peanut Butter Cup matter of fact I'm a greedy type of cat I would eat both of these but not because this one is satisfying this would kill so I recommend this product this is a month but I'm hollering charlady could do some more these videos if this is over", "GK02v6sNVUs": "[Music] the key thing here is that there's just three ingredients so they're super easy are you ready to get started my ingredients here are obviously peanut butter and chocolate this is the two main ones but then what you do to make that nice easy peasy vanilla Pillsbury frosting I'm telling you it's that simple so I mix them all together and if you're not good with measuring caps this recipe is great because you don't even need to measure for a little bit of the chocolate chips if you want you can say about one cup and about 3/4 cup of each peanut butter and frosting and mix them together and then we're gonna melt them down so we'll start with our chocolate okay and I'll get it melt it down in the microwave there's my chocolate I'm gonna start here okay take a look so this is two thirty-second increments in the microwave and it's almost there but I'm gonna pop it in a little bit more alright so this is another 30 seconds and now I'm just gonna stir and get it nice and melted oh that looks perfect okay so this is the this is the texture that we want you want to make sure that you do not overheat your chocolate okay that can be your first misstep with this very easy recipe but if you overheat your chocolate though we problems okay so go slowly in increments and then stir alright the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take this chocolate with my awesome little scoop or how they recommend you pick one of these up and we're to scoop them into these silicone little flower shaped containers you can use whatever shape you want as long as it's silicone okay because it's God this is like a very nonstick so anything you put in there will come out and peel out really easily these are perfect because they look like a Reese's Cup okay so I'm gonna take my little scoop and scoop it in there and with freshly washed hands okay firstly washed hands you can use your fingers you can get a glove if you want you can get a little spatula and do this but this is the easiest way I promise you we're just going to get it all the way around the edges up to the side for as tall as you want your recess cup okay tada there we go never do with the rest of them [Music] these little chocolate cups and we're going to pop them in the freezer and reserve the rest of our melted chocolate for the top layer because we still need some more and now we're onto the filling so again all this says is your peanut butter and your Pillsbury vanilla frosting and we're just gonna pop it in the microwave for 25 seconds umm low power and what's gonna happen is that that frosting is gonna melt a lot quicker than the peanut butter but that's okay because soon as you see the frosting melted a little bit pop it out stir it around and you're good to go okay this is hot sauce look melted frosting peanut butter not quite so melted very carefully stir of course using microwave say fools everyone all right so here's one feeling it makes it together it hardens up really quickly so that's just fine okay and we're going to get our little fizzy stupor back which I washed using it with the chocolate you could buy two so we pull them out of the freezer they're looking good nice and hard okay and now we're going to scoop one little scoop into each Cup and then pop them all back in the freezer for a little bit there chocolate makes you so much melted and we'll turn it over the top it will be that much closer to fish [Music] okay so they are perfect I'll just pop them out of the freezer the filling is nice and hard okay we can press it down so we are into the final step and that is covering them with a little bit more chocolate we want a nice thin coating okay and I'll tell you why looks plain I've had not the type of people complain about what I make very often but I have had people complain that if you make it too thick of a coating then it hurts their teeth when they bite into these amazing so a nice thin coating people let's not go over the top with chocolate although you can never have too much chocolate this one instance is one of those times all right so these are all done now we have to pop them in the freezer but what we really want is there to be a nice flat tops and make sure that you have a nice flat top before you pop them in the freezer if that's how they're gonna harden and then the Reese's peanut butter cups I can't wait to show you anyway did you try these at home okay so pop them in free variety look at that we're done so all you have to do is peel them out of that little container and they come out perfect just like this like a little races pink back up three ingredients all right now we gotta try it got to try it well there you have it homemade America thank you so much for watching if you have any questions or comments strapping below and I would love to answer any of your questions like the sweet waiter with the Rickey Oh let's meet [Music] [Music]",

what is up guys welcome back to my channel and welcome back to my kitchen all right what's up youtube we're gonna be recreating reese's everybody ate them everybody cheats on them everybody loves them and we're going to be reviewing mr remington james as you saw the intro i mean i tried it it felt awkward but uh we're going to recreate his anabolic reese's peanut butter cups so i'm gonna take you along process [Music] all right step one we're gonna take this ice cube maker he used a mini muffin pan but i'm going to use this ice cube maker because i don't have a mini muffin pan but we're going to spray it with some olive oil so these reese's peanut butter cups do not stick and that is step number one all right step number two we're gonna take 42 grams of no sugar added chocolate and then we're gonna add 51 grams of hershey's chocolate syrup he used the light version but i do not have the light version so i'm gonna use the sugar free he said it was all right and we're gonna see in this video he said give it a little shake like this and we're gonna pop this in the microwave for 45 seconds [Music] all right once you get out of the microwave we got to do this next step fast he said we're going to add 16 grams of a whey chocolate protein and we're gonna give it a mixing all right once you get it done mixing it should look a little something like this and we want it a little hot because it's easier to spread so we're going to take that ice cube tray and we're going to place a little bit in each one [Music] once you get all that anabolic goodness spread out we're gonna make the peanut butter topping first step we're going to take 64 grams of pb2 powder tastes like peanut butter and less fat and then we're going to take 92 grams of egg beaters and we're gonna put that down in there and give it a mixing [Music] once you get it mixed it should look just like peanut butter and we're going to take it and we're going to spread it evenly on top of the chocolate that we put in there and i'll show you once we're done once you get it spread out you're going to take your spoon and we're going to move it all around just smooth it out make sure we get a even peanut butter coating once you get it spread out as best as you can you put it in the freezer for about an hour and i'll see you when it's done [Music] against you can't stop me me [Music] price but my time is all right so it's been about an hour a few seconds for you but i mean take a look at them they popped out just fine without a muffin pan and they look stinking delicious and they resemble reese's peanut butter cups yeah but before we try these we gotta put them to a test so of course we gotta try the the og uh nothing could beat the og though i don't think let's see creamy peanut buttery delicious man i can eat like 12 of those but wouldn't be good for the gains now those are delicious but you eat too many of those your abs are gonna disappear by the next day but these on the other hand are gonna give you some good gains some good protein [Music] and not make you feel bad after you eat them now let's give them a taste test [Music] are you sure these are healthy that's freaking good not mine that's good out of 10 i'll give it maybe a seven it's kind of cold kind of tastes like ice cream [Music] of course not as good as the o.g but that is good man i don't know if i can stop remington you really did something here oh yeah that is really good wow remington you really outdid yourself there um in that meal i mean it's basically a meal i'm full now but that was 57 grams of protein in that many little reese's peanut butter cups man 57 grams i'll pop the calories and the macros up on the screen but that's crazy i i don't i feel satisfied i don't need to go grab another real reese's y'all really need to go check out his channel i'll put his link down in the description go check him out leave a like comment on his videos if you could if you made it this far leave a comment delicious because that was straight up delicious i mean i gotta i'm you know what i'm just gonna finish this off right now um that is good like always thanks for watching i'll see y'all the next one peace peace", "H3TDVPSk85M": "hey guys Rochelle here as you know Shakeology you've been drinking it now every day for probably your breakfast but I want to show you how Shakeology is so much more versatile and how I don't want you to be afraid to experiment so today I am gonna show you one of my very favorite recipes that you do not drink you eat and actually it's going to mimic my very favorite candy and yes I did say candy so come on over I want to show you everything that you're gonna need now what I'm making are the Reese's chocolate peanut butter cups which I could eat day and night but obviously they're not healthy for you and it's not something that I could do for breakfast what I'm gonna show you I could do for breakfast so you need a packet of chocolate Shakeology or if you have the bag of Shakeology one scoop is what you'll need you're gonna need a packet of stevia or whatever other sweetener that you prefer to use and also you're going to need some peanut butter I personally prefer organic peanut butter but again whatever you're accustomed to using is absolutely fine and you're gonna need cupcake tin some liners a bowl measuring spoon and some things to mix with this is all that it's gonna take you're gonna see how quick and easy this is and I have to tell you excuse me this is actually a favorite of my child I have a ten-year-old and if he could live on honey nut cheerios he would and so whenever I'm able to sneak in nutrition for them it's a good thing and this is one way that I do it very easily so all you're gonna do is go ahead and open up that packet and full packet into the bowl along with the stevia the entire packet and then we're going to slowly add water I can't tell you the exact amount it goes more by what it looks like and then the amount of water basically what we want this to become is the kids SystemC of a thick pudding so this is gonna take just a little bit of time to mix up so at first it may become almost like a consistency of a frosting but once you've done it enough you're gonna get an idea because trust me once you've done it the first time you will make this again this is like something that you'll always do but you'll kind of get a feel for how much water you want to add so you can see it's almost like a thick pudding here and what this is gonna do is I'm gonna end up making four peanut butter cups and four peanut butter cups is actually the entire serving so if you eat you know 2 cups you're getting half the serving of Shakeology so it's something that I like to keep in the freezer because especially women PMS and we crave chocolate and all of that this is a wonderful wonderful way to still be able to do something healthy for your diet and for your body and still get those cravings under control this looks like this is actually pretty good maybe I'll add just a little more water you want it to be a you know that consistency of pudding simply because we want to be able to spread it I think we're looking pretty good there so as you can see a thick pudding so that's all we need to do we're gonna get four liners out and this is again it's very easy to make and trust me I'm probably one of the most undomesticated women that she'll ever meet I do not like to cook and this is something that even all do isn't that easy so you're gonna take an eighth of what's in this bowl and line at the bottom of each liner and through practice I've learned it's about when you have a teaspoon it's about that much that you're gonna add and I tend to use my fingers make sure your fingers are clean if you're having your kids help you this is something that you can have your children help you make and all you're gonna do is just kind of gently spread it around the bottom of the liner okay and you can get creative with what you fill it with too I personally want the peanut butter I love the peanut butter you can use almond butter you can use just about anything that you want if you're someone who likes like a jam or a jelly and has something that's like organic you could do that also although you're not going to get as much protein out of it and there will be sugar so that's why I tend to not go that route okay so our bottom is all taken care of and now the next thing is adding our peanut butter we are adding a half a tablespoon of peanut butter per cup and so basically we're ending up with two tablespoons which actually is the serving size for peanut butter I have to mix it because I have the organic so we have to mix the oil up and then at the tablespoon put it right in there actually let me it's a spoon instead of my finger cuz this is way stickier again just spreading it around this is something that you literally can make and have ready for your kids within an hour of them coming home from school and greet them with a healthy snack that they'll have no idea is healthy they're going to think that you're the coolest parent around because you're encouraging them to have chocolate and peanut butter now once you're done with the peanut butter all we're gonna do is put another layer of chocolate on top and because the Shakeology has been sitting there for a few minutes while we've done this I have found that sometimes it starts to thicken up so let's just take a look this actually looks like it's okay sometimes I have to add a little more water this looks like it'll do just fine and again about that much I add at this point we'll use another finger I tend to lick my fingers but I'm being and being nice because I'm on film actually I see how this is kind of difficult to spread right now I think I'm gonna need to add a little water yeah let's add a little bit of water and you don't have to be afraid about adding the water cuz again if I was just making this as a shake versus something like this I would be adding water anyways or whatever other liquids so you're not gonna ruin it gonna be just fine and again that's the beauty of Shakeology as you can play with it you don't have to feel like you're stuck in a rut you can find something that you really really like there we go that is better that spreads nice and nice and easy you want to make sure to use all the Shakeology up because if you're going to eat all for the serving you want to make sure or in the city and I should say you want to make sure you're having the full serving of Shakeology then we'll add some to that other one didn't want to spread this is it this is like all it is some here and then the very last thing that we're gonna do let's take our finished product and pop it in the freezer and you know it depends on how it freezes for you you want to get it to a firm consistency so you're able to take it out of the tin for us it usually takes about an hour or so but I'll come back and check so in just a few minutes I'll come back and we'll see what's going on okay so here we are it's been about an hour and I'm going to see if our chocolate peanut butter cups are ready and actually it looks like they are really what we're doing is we just want to make sure that they're firm enough that we can get them out of the cupcake holders that's all it is so we have all four here and I'm really thinking this looks like it's oh yeah so you look how easy you kind of have to peel it off but the wonderful thing is is honestly this feels like a cheat and it's not there's no cheating here whatsoever I can have all four of these in one sitting and be okay with it hey Jacob come on over here your chocolate peanut butter cups are ready the beautiful piece of this is my ten year old as I said before who is very very picky and what he eats what amazing he loves these things here but check out what I made awesome dude here because this is melted in my fingers though mm-hmm what's enough with that called sea ice frozen uh-huh that rhymes thanks mom you're welcome big monster milk with it just fish okay I'll get you that in just a second so as you can see again absolutely fabulous snack to have after school women when you're PMSing best thing that you can do is is make this you saw how simple it was so with that said everyone have a great day and enjoy the candy bye guys", "XY-6zCsmrXI": "good morning everyone I just got back from the gym um like 11:30 I was there oh god I got there at 9:00 um did but did cardio which explains why I'm like so drowned rat status right now like I just get so tired that I don't even bother to like change out of my sweaty sweatpants so I just like sit in my car and it's all wet and it's really disgusting but I am three weeks out yesterday and I got a picture of my suit today it's red it is so beautiful it is everything that I imagined um I really need to eat something right now so I'm gonna go fix drowned rat status and have a shower and not stink like Bo and then I will show you guys what I have for a meal - okay so this is what I have for meal number two is my post-workout meal I have 70 grams of rice with five grams of coconut oil and then I have here a hundred grams of chicken breast sauerkraut because fermented vegetables are like super good for gut health and then I just have raw zucchini and raw white mushrooms with of course mustard because mustard is my holy grail for this prep and then with my meals too I always drink one liter of water so like with every single meal I always drink a liter of water okay so I'm just gonna put on some makeup I really did not get a good sleep last night I oh god I had I couldn't sleep until 2:00 a.m. part of the reason was because I just got a macro drop and good god I was like starving last night until to a out I was like I'm so hungry and then I just had to like like mentally be like you're okay you are okay I didn't sleep good I've got these bags and I'm actually going out today my coach gave me a free meal tonight so that is awesome but when she gave me the free meal she was also like by the way your cardio was increased in your calories are down so I was like way to soften the blow at least I get a free meal so [Music] [Music] okay so this I haz concealer on it and this side does not pretty drastic change if you ask me I love this concealer it would cost me $40 but honestly it does its job okay done so today I have planned I want to go to the market and buy some chocolate chips because I do get a free meal tonight there is this recipe for peanut butter cups that you can make using powdered peanut butter and I have so much powdered peanut butter and I don't use it anymore because like I'd rather have oatmeal than powdered peanut butter to be honest yeah I want to make um a few of those and I will show you guys if it works out and it's probably gonna be an epic fail but yeah I want to try making those and then I'm goin for burgers at around 6:00 so I'll probably put makeup on again and get myself all ready all right I found a parking spot but it's like a few blocks away from the actual place I want to be it is really so busy and it's so hot I'm sweating so much but I have to pay for parking and I'm not too happy about it but I'm only gonna be like 20 minutes so it shouldn't be that much [Music] okay now I just need to figure out what kind of chocolate chips I want for the peanut butter cups because there's like apparently a bajillion different kinds here okay so these are the chocolate chips that ended up getting there are sixty percent dark I had to put them in the fridge right away because they started to melt in my car that is how hot it is it literally took me like seven minutes to drive home and they're like squishy so you know hopefully those are okay this is my fridge it's kind of jam-packed with like tuna and spinach and asparagus and chicken and rice and just a whole lot of prep things okay so the recipe is basically three ingredients i screenshot of this recipe right after my first or right after my second show one cup of powdered peanut butter 1 cup of water 3/4 of a cup of the chocolate chips you can use dark or you can use milk and then a quarter cup of almond milk but I'm going to use cashew milk just because it's lower in calories and it's what I have in my fridge okay so it says the first thing to do is add the dark chocolate chips to a microwave safe Bowl slowly add the almond milk or Kashi milk and then it'll create like a little creamy ganache apparently okay so I have mixed it all up I believe this is the kind of consistency you want and then you're going to want to split this into two equal parts okay so here is 1 cup of powdered peanut butter and then I have 1 cup of water and I'm just gonna mix it up until it is it's gonna be like kind of runny err than regular peanut butter but it'll be like the melted peanut butter okay so I actually used um 3/4 of a cup and I think this is like a pretty good consistency because I don't want it to be too so I'm just gonna say 3/4 of a cup is ideal so I just made a little layer of chocolate on the bottom of each of these and it says to put in the freezer for a few minutes before you add the peanut butter on top okay so I took these out of the freezer I think it was been like five minutes or something and it should be it's just to like get the ganache to solidify a little bit so next thing we want to do is fill up each of these equally with the powdered peanut butter and the water just a little side note I like my Reese's peanut butter cups salty so I added some Himalayan pink salt just to make it taste a little bit more peanut buttery because powdered peanut butter and it doesn't really taste like real peanut butter because you know so you add what you can do what you can okay so once you have all of your cupcake things filled up with equal amounts of the powdered peanut butter oh my God look at this one it's getting squished um you're gonna want to put it back in the freezer for another thirty minutes so that the peanut butter can solidify okay so these are all solid and I had to put the second part of the chocolates back into the microwave because it did solidify but it was like it was okay and then I also found some shredded coconut I just have a little bit because I think I want to only do coconut with half of them so I'm just gonna put a top layer on each one of these and then I'm probably gonna sprinkle some coconut on a few of them this one just white chocolate this one I put a little bit on and then that one I just whatever put the rest on I'm gonna put these back in the freezer for a little bit and then when I take them out I will show you I will open one up and we will see if this has been a success or not okay so I was chosen by muscle and fitness hers to become the next feature in the muscle and fitness hers magazine so

tell you a little bit about one of my favorite snacks there are Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups they are creamy peanut butter covered in dark chocolate if you don't have a Trader Joe's buy you you could still order these online pretty easily they're pretty easy to find and they are delicious growing up I was always a really big Reese's Peanut Butter Cup fan that was always my favorite snack to have in the house if I was told I could have whatever candy I wanted from the store I would always pick out Reese's peanut butter cups and I know that dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bit healthier for you and I'm sure Reese's old oh it's delicious has like a lot of kind of like junk in it and other stuff besides just peanut butter and chocolate so I think that this might be a little bit of a healthier version they also say dark chocolate is supposed to be simply better for you that milk chocolate the dark chocolate is really decadent it's delicious definitely my favorite makes a perfect snack dessert or gifts I think these are really fun like for Valentine's Day if you're getting people take candies or chocolates these are nice to put in with the gifts they are so delicious I'm a huge huge fan I've actually turned funds on to this and I love that you're able to find Trader Joe's products online if you don't have one near you because I know they're not as prevalent as other grocery stores and I just happen to love almost all their products everything I try I really like trying to surround so the ingredients ingredients are semi-sweet chocolate chocolate liqueur cocoa butter chocolate liqueur process with alkali dry milk fat so I chucked in an emulsifier and vanilla peanuts sugar palm kernel oil palm oil lactose salt and soy election and emulsifier I think the only thing that you have to really worry about with these is if you're getting them delivered just to make sure that you know hopefully they wouldn't melt or something like that I'm gonna keep them in a cool dry place could cow minimum 50% and I think the cow is actually supposed to be pretty good for you and they do have milk chocolate and I believe these are gluten-free but I know I think that if they have milk chocolate peanut butter cups as well that they make if you prefer that to dark chocolate I know not everybody likes dark chocolate then those are also really good I've also purchased their stock chocolate-covered almonds those are always really good just I love everything Trader Joe's makes it's definitely my favorite kind of stuff to buy if there's definitely fantastic I think you can wear them online actually in a 4-pack too if you want more definitely will meet your dark chocolate covered peanut butter cup cravings I could definitely eat a whole bag of these this is the mini bag see so this one is 3.5 ounces and I think that it came with eight of these and in the bag let me pick it up and of course like on my way home from the store eats through a peanut butter cups before dinner because they're just so good they are kosher so you could see on the label there let's look at the nutrition facts the serving size is about three pieces servings per container about three 180 calories calories from fat 100 total fat 11 grams saturated fat 6 grams trans fat zero grams cholesterol 0 grams sodium they need 5 milligrams total carbohydrate 21 grams dietary fiber 2 grams sugar 17 grams protein 2 grams iron 8% but you could also I forget what the exact ounces but if you want like a larger container you could also get a larger container of these online and those aren't individually wrapped in the mold wrapper like that like this they're just I think it's the same exact product so I think that the ones in the bigger container which are I think each container is about a pound and comes with 36 of these peanuts small peanut butter cups in there so if you want a larger one you have the option to do that too but if you just want to try them out see if you like them first which I like to do I like to get like a smaller product if it's something I'm not sure of and just check it out make sure I like it first by getting a smaller pack I always do that I'm all about the trial size and then this is what the peanut butter cup looks like delicious so yummy perfect size boom melting a little bit you order these you like chocolate and peanut butter you're gonna love it so they're Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups creamy peanut butter covered in dark chocolate and this was the mini bag hope you guys found the video useful and I thank you so much for watching have a great night guys you", "qz3MKQcxWLE": "chocolate peanut butter cups I have given this recipe to hundreds of people chocolate peanut butter together they are every bit as good as Reese's peanut butter cups I use soy milk in place of heavy cream its limbs it down a bit means you can eat more line your muffin tin with paper liners so that when they're all cool they pop right out of the paper and stay clean and beautiful melt the margarine or butter over medium-high heat scoop out the peanut butter add the graham cracker crumbs and the sugar and stir until it's melted and fully incorporated take it off the heat and gently spoon it into the muffin cups use any spoon you want just make sure you put about equal amounts into every muffin cup now place it in the fridge and let it cool for about 30 minutes you're already done with the peanut butter part how easy was that all you gotta do is the chocolate topping and I can taste the finished product already so you're going to melt the chocolate and the soy milk stirring constantly over a low flame you don't want to burn your chocolate so this I would babysit a little bit once the chocolate is totally melted and your peanut butter cups have cooled take your peanut butter cups out of the fridge and again gently spoon the chocolate over the peanut butter what makes these a little bit different than Reese's peanut butter cups is I like to top them with a little bit of heath bar crunch or crumbled nuts but don't worry if you don't like any fussy topping just leave it as pure smooth chocolate throw them in the fridge let them set for about two hours then they're ready to go please store in the freezer for about three months and you can keep them in the fridge for up to about two weeks but guess what there's no way they're going to last that long let us know how you like these and check out all our other great recipes from adjust her network you", "yCXPq1w4j7Y": "stuffing messy I'm already getting it everywhere welcome back to nacho Mama's cooking show today we will be making peanut butter cups this is a nice easy recipe it only requires a few ingredients they ready let's get started [Music] alright for this week a nut butter cup recipe you will need semi-sweet chocolate chips powdered sugar peanut butter and softened butter so to start we're gonna take our softened butter we're gonna put it into our mixing bowl we want to get that nice and creamy so I'm just gonna set this mixer on a low stir setting to just kind of get the butter go on and we're gonna take two-thirds of a cup of powdered sugar I'm just gonna scoop it out I want to get this measurement right but I don't think it's going to kill me if it's a little bit more than it should be stuff is messy I'm already getting it everywhere and now we're gonna take three quarters of a cup of peanut butter [Music] now that we've beat up to butter a little bit I'm going to go ahead and add the peanut butter into the mix I'm gonna do is I'm gonna kind of stir it in there a little bit before I start at the mix I mix it in with the butter I'm gonna let that whip together now I'm gonna slowly add in the powdered sugar now it's getting a nice good mix and I was nice knees he wasn't it [Music] all right so our peanut butter has come together it looks nice and creamy like the sugar and the butter really thickened it up a little bit but what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take a bag of our chocolate chips you know all the recipes I looked at they didn't really say how many chocolate chips that you needed so I'm just gonna start with one bag and move on from there maybe we'll need more we got a lot of peanut butter so I'm gonna do the kind of double boiler method I got a pan here that I'm gonna let come to a boil and I'm the chocolate chips in a bowl over that pan and that way the heat convecting from the water and the steam will melt the chocolate and not burn it fingers crossed as usual it's my first time doing this never done this before so again fingers crossed [Music] while we wait for that I'm gonna take my peanut butter and I'm gonna transfer it into this piping bag that way when we assemble it we can just squeeze the peanut butter in there [Music] now we're gonna check in on our chocolates been sitting here a little bit [Music] all right so our chalk is nice and melted I popped up our peanut butter taste it a little bit yummy so what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna take the chocolate and I'm gonna fill up the bottom of these peanut butter cup wrappers and then I'm gonna let that cool kind of stabilize it out and then I'm gonna add the peanut butter and then I'm going to add another layer of chocolate on top of that we'll see how this goes [Music] alright so after a couple although I want to kind of get my chocolate settle this is turning out better than I thought I'm gonna go ahead and get the peanut butter on there [Music] [Music] we're all dead yeah yeah this is so cool these peanut butter cups look amazing I'm surprised I got them as filled to the brim as I did stuck them in the freezer so they'd freeze got a pretty good layer I think next time I'll use cupcake wrappers because these tend to be taller I bought these peanut butter cup wrappers from Amazon which were cool I just felt like I wanted to make it look more professional or more like a Reese's but here we go [Music] chocolates on plant not too sweet to plan nobody's dead box over but like I was saying when we kind of more peanut butter in there I'm sure some of these have more peanut butter than others like because when you can see the peanut butter is kind of sticking out on the edge right there so I bet that one's full of peanut butter this has been not your mama's cooking show you know all that good stuff subscribe like comment smash the bell we will catch next time because I'm about to chow down on my peanut butter Cubs [Music]", "m22jKw1gRdo": "[PEPPY MUSIC]", "immxPLxdpd8": "what's going on guys we have an exciting show for you today because we're doing product reviews but it's only things you can find in stores whereas usually we do reviews of just anything sent to us mostly stuff you have to order online this is all new stuff you can get in stores that we purchased and i'll tell you exactly where we got all of it so we're going to start with since this is the hot stuff we've got reds yeah i've never heard of this brand before but it seems like they're doing some good stuff yeah so they make these breadless sandwiches that we've actually been getting a lot matt's been liking so there's two flavors there's a chicken apple sausage and then a turkey sausage and here i have heated the chicken apple sausage up 200 calories 12 grams of fat 17 protein and then five total and net carbs so it's egg cheese meat egg and then i also found this so all this i said it's sprouts right so this is a chicken tikka masala bowl with riced cauliflower the macros are 280 calories for this dish 19 grams of fat 15 grams of protein and then 11 total carbs and three fiber eight net carbs for this bowl i'm just not seeing a lot of chicken in there me neither as far as the ingredients go the sandwiches are good to go but this one does have some canola oil in it so he's pretty authentic so the man who's never been to india i mean i eat a lot of indian food i know a good chicken tikka masala it's not very flavorful yeah maybe it's not that authentic tomato heavy is it i don't think it's tomato heavy at all it's not tomato heavy enough for me i wouldn't get that i wouldn't either it's a lot of there it's a there's not a lot of substance to it mostly cauliflower just cauliflower rice no this one is pretty good it's really hot but if you did get it like i've done this before i've gotten something like this and then added my own chicken to it right you can up the seasoning and the meat on it if you do have it the egg witches are a little lacking in flavor but they're a really nice lunch to have that you just like microwave really quick wow that's really good i didn't expect that much out of it like now i could imagine myself envision myself eating one for sure oh okay so enlightened you may know them as a big ice cream low carb ice cream brand they just came out with these mini cheesecakes and they have like five flavors um but i just grabbed the one classic and lightning does some pretty good stuff they they walk the line pretty well between like decent ingredients and the stuff tastes good overall i kind of like what they're doing oh look how cute it's like an individually packaged cheesecake so are these frozen or what are these yeah they were both in the frozen section oh and i found both of these at sprouts but i think they're cheesecakes i think i might have seen them in publix cookie dough bites so these are peanut butter cookie dough whoa 24 pieces is a serving size hello texture is like nothing you really can get on keto doughy really doughy 24 pieces is 110 calories eight fat six protein 11 total carb and three fiber and four erythritol i get a little bit of a weird aftertaste which i don't love but overall the flavor is pretty good the texture is really what sets it apart i don't get any aftertaste i would pound this bag but i feel like a lot of people will be excited for these cheesecakes so one you want to open that up one cheesecake is it's pretty small but it's 210 calories 20 fat for protein and then 18 total carbs that's pretty high with eight erythritol and one fiber so oh and then seven allulose so two net carbs but it's pretty small right it's a good size there better be a fat crust at the bottom get to the crust crust is my favorite what's your favorite part of the cheesecake crust you're lying you know that's mine that's cheesecake for sure this is classic new york cheesecake and they hit it out of the park they have four other flavors we have a pumpkin chocolate strawberry and caramel chocolate good right pretty good it's missing something what i think it has everything you'd want i think it's just a little too cold yeah you're supposed to thought more yeah this is pretty solid would you get it again no me neither i do think i would get these again possibly i don't think i'd get either so these i found at costco and they're called almond keto bites i tried a few of these already four bites is 150 calories 12 grams of fat 5 grams of protein and then 14 total carbs with four fiber five erythritol so five net carbs almond flour erythritol flax seeds salt baking powder inulin you get a really nice almond vanilla flavor that's almond extract isn't that i think maybe it's a nice texture texture is good sweetness is pretty good too it's not too sweet it's actually pretty good i like it i feel like it's not really something i would go to but if you're a muffin person those are good those are these are always winner for being at costco so yeah costco is where i got them those are a winner egg life where'd you get these sprouts so sprouts has a whole like low-carb bread section we're gonna definitely do a haul there soon because they have as you can see from this segment a ton of stuff and people have been saying these are really really good which is hard to believe because it's just egg whites so these are egg white wraps okay so now i haven't opened them before yeah they're thick and fluffy but never tried them it makes me question whether they'll actually hold up to like a wrap they look like marshmallow yeah i think they will hold up for sure yeah they're super palliable pliable it's powerful malleable pliable completely flavorless it'll take on whatever you put in it it's pretty flavorless yeah and i like that it's 25 calories it's just protein there's nothing else it's better than the egg thins we get and it's better than like almond flour wraps in my opinion because i'd rather just eat egg whites right this is like simpler i actually like this like i could eat this whole thing and enjoy it you'd eat that on its own yeah you're weird ingredients just egg whites xanthan gum i think egg whites xanthan gum and natural flavors yeah so we made an instagram story about these the other day right yeah we tried these already they're pretty good they're the new bulletproof bars yeah the original bulletproof bars are like eight or nine grams of carbs each these are only four it's basically cashews and collagen is like the major ingredients it's like a chocolate coated bar it's actually pretty good um it has a nice texture and then the macros for a bar 160 calories 11 fat 7 protein and then 12 total carbs seven of which is fiber and only one sugar alcohol and i've tried all the flavors i think my personal favorite is coconut have you tried that one yet i've only tried no i've only tried the double chocolate and the vanilla cookie the vanilla cookie is really good let's try coconut then all the flavors are pretty good but yeah these are good they're just expensive you know that's another thing three bucks each yeah they are three bucks each and they're only 160 calories but i did find them i've only ever seen them at whole foods strong chocolate flavor that's really good strong coconut flavor yeah it's a really aggressive bar overall but it kind of satisfies your cravings and you don't need to eat afterwards whoo yeah you're at a lot so we filmed two videos in a row of product reviews this is our third starting to catch up this is tough and we got a lot to go we're doing it for you guys oh ratio so this is like i think like general mills or something right is it yeah yeah general mills this is like their first low-carb company offerings they've made so i got this actually at a local grocery store called nature's pick i've also seen these at costco they sell like a big box of them and i think a lot of people have mentioned these so i feel like they're in a lot of different stores my only thoughts when you're really dealing with a big company like general mills is you know they're cutting all the corners to to get the cost as low as possible so they have two flavors they have whatever that is toasted almond and this is lemon almond did i try this already once i know i think so the ingredients almonds pumpkin seeds soy protein coconut oil erythritol whey protein soy protein chicory root fiber why is there soy protein soy and whey protein seems bad why so one bar is 220 calories 17 fat 12 protein nine carbs and three fiber and then four sugar alcohols and uh it looks kind of like a nature valley bar one net carb texture is very similar to a nature valley bar a little bit not as crunchy i got like a real strong extract flavor good job almond yeah almond extracts really coming through which some people don't like i kind of like it but i don't like that but even i don't like that one i love this texture the texture is pretty good flavor i think could be improved if you see these in the store maybe it's worth a try is it really not one of my favorites no i don't i like the texture a lot but like the flavor is not great so nash you know i like they have the the square cakes i'm full yeah do you want to stop no did i try one of these too i think i did this company they've been making keto stuff for a while my complaint is always like the texture is 100 on point it's just the flavor doesn't come through so this is a cookie they have uh like little mini loafs mini muffin things so i also got these at the local nature's pick but i'm pretty sure also in walmart so this is a snickerdoodle cookie the ingredients are really good with this company usually organic flax egg yolk water tapioca fiber coconut oil blah blah blah some fibers added to it this has plant fibers pea potato and plantain and kelp and norwegian kelp yeah why i don't know okay the smell i'm getting from this is really out there is it not good is it old i don't know try a different one that was super gross the plant yeah i'm getting like kelp strongly maybe it's because i already read that now i'm thinking it but i'm getting the chocolate one i don't remember now doesn't it smell a little weird yeah yeah i don't know what's going on with these these are really not great people are probably confused why we keep trying i just want to make sure they're not bad this one's actually the best one this one's not bad it's not sweet there's no real flavor there's a little bit of a weird flavor one of the worst cookies i've ever tasted in my life applying them a cookie is just kind of an insult oh my god nosh would you do this because it's not a cookie it's like a muffin consistency so you know they're like square cakes yeah people love those i don't think they're that great the flavor is not good the texture is really good yeah i regret i don't understand anything i don't understand how this gets made because i think nash is like a reasonably big company oh baby these are back so if you are new to like that they're new so if you are new to quest or like protein var world back in the day probably 2014 or 15 quests used to make peanut butter cups and they were not really good but i did yeah but they were like really chalky but like i enjoyed them because i thought they were healthier and they were healthier and they tasted kind of sweet and good so like i used to order them and eat them i'm wondering how these compare i imagine they've made huge improvements since then two cups is a serving thank you because usually it's one cup of serving which is dumb so two cups is 190 calories it's basically their bar i feel 15 fat 11 protein 13 total carbs four fiber eight erythritol so one net carb for two cups and then the ingredients are literally just their bar so whey protein erythritol soluble corn fiber oh it's unsweetened chocolate so that'll be interesting butter fat what's butter fat they're like exactly the same size as right normal reese's i'm not a big peanut butter cup fam those are really good no they're not really good i expect super delicious i expected so much more they're super delicious there's no good peanut butter center it's basically one homogenous flavor throughout no they taste exactly like reese's cups oh come on this is just super hard the middle's super hard try it again chalky i think that's really really really good i think they crushed that they did not crush that you guys let us know below you have to go out and get these so i got these at target i'm sure you can get them elsewhere i think the old ones were better i expected more i give these like an eight and a half the lilies came out with new chocolate chips i thought that'd be fun to review i can't do much more oh let's just do the white chocolate chips those look good so i think there's three new kinds but i only found the white baking and then the salted caramel lilies have been doing a lot the normal baking chips they're like also in publix now i've seen like they're just more um they are available which is nice i always love a good white chocolate chip yeah because it's not really common with keto yep that's it they nailed it it's okay what yeah those are pretty good i think after eating so much you just like lost i think my palate might be shot but yeah those are good they're super good you melt this down top stuff put it in baked goods it'd be good in cookies like macadamia white chocolate chip cookies we have these keto fudge bites so these i found at trader joe's my friend actually found them and she was like whoa she got super excited so i thought i would give them a try they have like a tootsie roll consistency don't they yeah so one bite is 100 calories seven grams of fat six protein and then eight total carbs and six fibers so two net carbs it's the same as everything else we basically just eaten 15 of the same things in different formulations and this is the antithesis of that this is every product every keto thing we've ever eaten right here all wrapped into one that was losing his mind this really is it though this is like what keto products are and this tastes just like the rest of them yeah texture-wise i wouldn't run out and get them i like them i feel like i am losing it a little bit right now one more oh man i'm in some kind of heightened state no epic chicken chips okay that's a welcomed change up so the ingredients are chicken coconut flour and salt that's it so the entire pouch is a serving 190 calories seven fat 22 protein eight carb six fiber okay save the best for last i think so whoa they're super like hard like pepperonis nothing like a salt in my mouth it's like a piece of uncooked pasta isn't it those are really bad but with that being the case no i wouldn't say they're really bad they're horrendous they're not great maybe this entire video just proves how desperate people on like low carb diets are for anything that is an alternative we started off so strong too yeah this video overall was kind of disappointing i had higher hopes you have the breakfast sandwiches winner you thought these were a winner right they're okay enlightened these are okay too uh oh we didn't try these they're kissing my kid okay one more guys kiss my keto does bars i guess they also do cookies and i found these as sprouts as well and butter cookies just sounds so good butter we have butter cookies on our site they're really good nice texture nice size this tastes a little burnt to you yep oh burp not buttery enough well they're burnt but good i like them come on they're among the better things we tried today for sure but they're really burnt i could see if they weren't burnt they would be pretty good and i think burnt with a tea at the end is a word right you just use it ten times i hope it's a word so winners like we said it's just the sandwich i would say these are in the category of winter i would say the chocolate chips those are pretty good you can't go wrong i mean add it baking season's coming up guys oh the bulletproof bars yeah those are winners i think people are gonna love the quest reese's cups i think people would love these too oh probably all right that's it guys that's it for the video this was a tough [Music] one foreign", "7n5faRiDZ7s": "scientists are baffled by the sudden appearance of flat circular areas in these fields even more baffling are the traces of real milk chocolate and peanut butter found nearby with me is Rory Tate a circle researcher have you any idea what caused these circles I'm not sure but I feel very close to a major discovery Reese peanut butter cups real milk chocolate and peanut butter together", "u--yO2LfRqs": "hello youtube this is my review of reese's new mellow top peanut butter cups now apparently these things aren't supposed to release till easter 2021 but i got my early hands on them for my local cvs there you see nutrition facts 180 calories 19 grams of carbs 1 gram of fiber 18 grams of sugar that doesn't matter what we're going to do is we're going to do a review let's open these bad boys episodes are all about so all right as you can see here you look like just any regular white chocolate reese's peanut butter cup all right obviously that's a marshmallow coating on top that's what they look like so out of the package that thing right there usually bothers me there's a little bit left we're not gonna worry about that right now all right see these things look like it's your ordinary peanut butter cup looks like there's just a thin layer of marshmallow white topping on the top so it's not completely covering the marshmallow i'm sorry not the marshmallow but the reese's peanut butter cup let's see what it looks like when we break it open all right as you can see here it's just a thin layer of marshmallow on top so nothing too special not covering the entire inside of the reese's peanut butter cup which i like so it's just your standard reese's peanut butter cup with just a thin layer of marshmallow on top all right let's do a taste test hmm all right one more bite let's fish this bad boy off all right let's see what the marshmallow coating actually tastes like on its own i got a little bit of peanut butter on it so the marshmallow isn't really too much of a distinct flavor from the entire peanut butter cup as i said it tastes like just a standard reese's peanut butter cup although when you taste the marshmallow on the tone it does give a slightly better taste not a complete marshmallow taste just a slightly better taste almost as as if it was white chocolate consistency alright guys as you can see there we got one more left let me see that probably later well that's my review on the reese's marshmallow top i'm sorry reese's map sorry i said it wasn't really anything too special just a thin layer of marshmallow on the top which you can honestly do with the regular reese's pen buttercup and just get a little bit of marshmallow however this does replace the top for the chocolate portion we also got the chocolate portion on the bottom like i said it's not really anything too special just a thin layer of marshmallow on top which you can honestly just do on your own by getting just any marshmallow and just throw it on top of a recess and boom you got yourself a reese's mallow top all right that's my review on the reese's marshmallow top i've already give it a review on a scale of one to ten [Music] honestly i probably give it about a five just because as i said this is your standard reese's cup i don't think too special however it is easter related so i guess you could give it that part but hey if you want to buy it just for the holidays well i'm sorry for easter holidays then it'd be worth it but if you were to buy it on its own just for the taste and not worth it just get your standard reese's cup if you wanted something tasted better did a freaking marshmallow just like what i'm gonna do right now all right youtube what i went ahead and did is i grabbed my own mini marshmallows add them to the mix it did taste a little better just almost like a fluffernutter however like i said the reese's marshmallow top weren't really too good because they didn't really give too much of a distinct taste of that marshmallow marshmallow is too thin now reese's could do to upgrade in my opinion is they go and release a new reese's cookie or something with marshmallow inside it fluffy marshmallow kind of like that that type of marshmallow not no marshmallow top thing not a hardened marshmallow actual marshmallow like a reese's cookie or something all right so i'm like a reese's s'more two graham crackers reese's cup in between and on top of that a fluffy marshmallow i like those christmas things i don't know what they're called but uh you know those marshmallow filled chocolates kinda like that but reese's instead it'll be a whole lot better reese's step your game up you could do it this is my review like i said five out of ten wasn't really too much of a distinct taste of that reese's marshmallow but anyways that does it for today's review peace out", "4wlEccQchIE": "hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction on today's episode we're talking candy not actual candy chocolate candy so I'm gonna be showing you how to make a giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup it's not so giant that you couldn't eat it all by yourself but it's probably so giant that you should need it all by yourself I'm not gonna judge either way let's get started on today's giant peanut butter cut recipe as always I'm gonna leave all of your quantities for your ingredients in the description box below and for your equipment today I've got an offset spatula a spoon and a clean ruler and I'm using a non stick metal tart or quiche pan mine's got a removable base in it you can also use a silicone pan for this which is a little bit easier but then not as wildly available I've got a little bit of sifted icing sugar which is also known as confectioners sugar or powdered sugar some smooth peanut butter some salted butter and some melted milk chocolate I've got a large mixing bowl and you can use a wooden spoon here but to save my arms I've got an electric mixer and also a little bit of baking paper so first up we need to line the base of our tin so like I said mines removable and I'm just gonna place a piece of baking paper over it flip it over and then just fold that in so that I'm kind of making a nice neat circle I don't recommend cutting a circle of baking paper if you're using the ones with a removable base because the chocolate tends to move around if you're tapped in doesn't have a removable base then yes just cut a circle of baking paper and if you're using a silicone mold you need nothing at all once it's lined you want to scoop in a generous amount of that milk chocolate and I'm gonna leave my recommended quantities down below it's important here that your chocolate layer is not too thin so I'm just using the back of a spoon just to even it out and to scoop it up the sides of my little tart tin as you can see I'm making sure that I get it not too thin on the sides not too thick in the corners and relatively even on the bottom take that now and pop it off into the fridge to completely set and while that's setting we can make our peanut butter filling place all of your powdered sugar into a lie mixing bowl and then you want to scoop in all of your peanut butter is just spatula just to make sure that I didn't waste any of it and then you also want to add your butter so your butter should be really really nice and soft or even a little bit melted is fine here you can use a wooden spoon but like I said I like to save my arms a little bit so I'm gonna use the electric mixer started on a really low speed oh you're gonna end up with a bit of a dust storm once it's mixed through a little bit you can turn that speed up to about a medium and you want to mix them till they're just nicely combined this mix just supposed to be a little bit thick and lumpy looking in the poll but once we sort of need it and squish it down it will perfectly resemble a smooth peanut butter cup inside take your chocolate base out of the fridge now and because we've used that little base it should really really easily come out of that nonstick case be really gentle with it here and if you find that any of your chocolates kind of overlap to that baking paper just use a knife to kind of take away any major excess and you should just be able to kind of just jiggle it away from the edges it should pop out quite nicely you can use another knife just to trim off any excess so you've got a really nice neat flat base on your peanut butter cup now because your chocolate shells gonna be quite fragile you want to take your peanut butter mixture because we really do firmly press this down so you can see here when you squeeze it it's quite firm almost like a cookie dough or a fondant so you want to put all of your peanut butter mixture into your empty tart pan now and this is where the nonstick is slightly better in the silicone because it's got a bit more structure so I'm using a lot of pressure and a lot of weight to just really push that peanut butter filling down into the same shape as the top pan once that's pushed down you want to pop it out of the top pan and then you can use a knife just to scrape around the edges because you don't want to be exactly the same size as your case you want it to be ever so slightly smaller so I'm just using the line of that nonstick base just to really run my knife around so I end up with like a nice disc of peanut butter filling here's your offset spatula or even your ruler here just to remove that disk of peanut butter because it'll be a bit stuck to that tray base and then you want to clean your tart pan out and you want to place the chocolate shelf back into the pan for additional support take your disk of peanut butter deliciousness place it straight into your base and it should fit pretty perfectly and just press it down around the edges you want to leave a gap of about a half a cent two meter above the line of where that peanut butter disc finishes at the top of your tart mould pour over the rest of your melted milk chocolate and you better have to have a little bit too much here then a little bit too little because we want it to really nicely fill our tart tray and just distribute it around and kind of push it into any gaps along the side using the back of your spoon try to make sure that your chocolate here is melted but not hot I'm gonna use a ruler kind of like if I was laying fresh cement so first I'm just distributing that chocolate so that it's relatively even over the top of my little tart case and then I'm gonna do one final sweep to make sure I've got a beautiful smooth top to my Reese's Peanut Butter Cup pop that on back in the fridge to set but before you want to serve it this can just sit at room temperature so it doesn't need to be refrigerated and you don't really want it refrigerated or it's gonna be impossible to cut into or to bite through they've got your gorgeous giant Reese's peanut butter candy Cup I hope you guys have loved this idea for more amazing sweets baking ideas recipes and crazy cool things you can make your friends and family make sure you check out my youtube channel my cupcake addiction subscribe for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching", "zLPlxxkBxdw": "what's going on out there YouTube just a few minutes before work here that get a quick video in today it's been a busy couple days so I haven't done a video in a couple days but still october i still have the rest of the month to kinda make up for that today what we're doing is kind of a new deal here it's called is it vegan and episode 1 i'm sure lots of you guys are familiar with this Justin's dark chocolate peanut butter cups organic okay so I was always under the impression that these were vegan and then for whatever reason I was reading the back here see says contains peanuts soy tree nuts and milk so I'm thinking what the so I read through all the ingredients and I can't I can't find any milk ingredients I've read through it like five times I'm like so where where's the melt coming from so anyway when in doubt when in doubt always go to the source basically I mean I've always had pretty good luck contacting companies if if I suspect that there may be an animal product or there's a product or there's an ingredient in there that could either be plant-based or animal-based and they'll be happy to clarify ninety-nine percent of the time some companies won't even respond you love to be like off but most companies will respond to you about it so I went on to Justin's website and basically what it is is so yeah they do have the milk chocolate in the white chocolate ones those ones do contain milk now there's no milk ingredients in the dark chocolate ones so they are vegan in that sense but the reason why they put that on there that it contains mouth is because there's a possibility of cross-contamination because they do they are processed on the same equipment that the white chocolate and the milk chocolate ones are now the good news is they actually do have an extensive sanitation process that they do between batches so it's not like they're directly touching each other or anything like that but there is a chance and also the companies that they source their chocolate from there's also a chance that that chocolate can be test on equipment that shared with milk ingredients as well so there's definitely no added animal products in here but they put that disclaimer on here basically just so if you have a you know a severe allergic reaction to milk or something like that then then yeah there's a possibility of cross-contamination but like anything I mean if you read the ingredients on anything you know most stuff nowadays says you know processed on shared equipment with milk and blah blah blah or tree nuts and blah blah you know there's always a chance that there's going to be my new amounts you know what I mean that's just how shits process today not a whole lot you can do about that but the good news is these are vegan there's no animal product ingredients in there if you are you know just like strict enough to where you don't want anything even shared on equipment with that has milking greens and this may not be for you but overall they're they're good so anyway that's pretty much it I gotta get to work go uh go talk to some people at work here so anyway hola I'll see you guys tomorrow I hope everybody's having a good weekend so far till next time guys take care", "hSiDr68KEOc": "okay so my family is a lover of the traditional Reese's Peanut Butter Cup pretty much I think everybody in the family loves them it's like the favorite candy I go shopping for Easter candy and pretty much that's all I try to focus on is getting them their fill of Reese's peanut butter cups mmm so recently I heard about a variety of other peanut butter cups that may or may not be superior to the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and so I brought it to them and said hey let's have a blind taste test challenge of these items so that we can figure out if they are truly superior to the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in the eyes of my family so we went to Trader Joe's and we got their milk chocolate peanut butter cups and we got a little version of the dark chocolate peanut butter cups because most of them think that the dark chocolate is not going to be great but I think that they may be wrong we also picked up the Justin's peanut butter cups and I got both the dark chocolate and the milk chocolate because I heard from a friend that these are pretty dang awesome and so that is partly what's spawned this idea and then I thought okay these are peanut butter roundels dark and chocolate nut patties and creamy peanut butter centers you know kind of a similar thing and so I thought maybe it'd be fun to try those as well and just for kicks I threw in a sunflower seed butter cup and I'll be honest my problem is my family is probably not gonna eat this one so I will be the only one trying that one so we have a variety of these kinds and we are going to do a blind taste test and see which one's which one is the winner okay so peanut butter this is milk oh yeah so here's my Mathis phone but we giving everybody a plate with one through seven on and piece and now they're going to personally eat each one and decide which ones are their favorites [Music] at which one was your favorite so far numbers numbers - Oh Adam which was your favorite so far number two number three which one is your favorite so far Boh which one was your favorite number five okay number one I give a seven out of ten very smooth all right number two I gave a five but it's pretty bland that's how I learned that number three was a seven the peanut butter taste is very good number four was a six no additional comments number five the three we're gonna let a three just speak for himself number six was a seven also pretty decent and number seven there's five with a fairly not good applicants we're gonna go with that creases over here doing math tallying it up all right so the merchants verdict is in and we have our winners here third place is the monster group of taste testers there's eight of us right third place was Trader Joe's milk chocolate peanut butter cups and second place is Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups there's half of it and first place of the group no I don't know if I agree with it it wasn't my boat but the family says Reese's peanut butter cups more people voted for that his first place so there we go we saw by the expensive chocolate for this family and discord my own so that is our verdict based on our eight people that tried to in which are under the age of eight but I'm just saying and yeah there we go", "JFPXSO7pC1I": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

i'm dee and we are back in the kitchen making christmas cookies today i am doing peanut butter cookies with little peanut butter cups in them they are so good and everybody is going to love them they're perfect for cookie exchanges etc any time of year really so let's get to the ingredients okay first of all we have one pound of butter four sticks two cups two cups of brown sugar two cups of white sugar four eggs two cups of peanut butter two teaspoons of salt two teaspoons of baking soda four cups all purpose flour two teaspoons vanilla i have three cups of these little mini uh reese's peanut butter cups or you could use full size ones and i have these on reserve what i usually do is once i get it together if i feel it needs a little bit more chocolate rather than going with the more expensive peanut butter cups i'll just add in a bag of hershey's kisses or how much ever i want so let's get going first thing we're going to do is take of the salt and baking soda and just stir them into the flour a little bit and we're going to set that aside and then we're going to put our butter in and start creaming it we're just going to cream this butter until it lightens up a little bit now this was softened butter so now i'm going to put in the brown sugar and oops and start mixing that in i usually clean this for a couple of minutes until all the sugar is pretty well incorporated we're now going to add in the white sugar and do the exact same thing just cream it in with the butter and the other sugar i'm now going to add the eggs in one at a time next comes the vanilla and the peanut butter this bowl is getting really full i may transfer it when i mix the wet and dry ingredients together just to give myself more room but let's get this peanut butter [Music] [Music] now gonna put the flour mixture in a little bit at a time see if i can get all of this in here this is going to make a ton of cookies folks [Music] as you can see i switched to my larger bowl i'm now going to put the peanut butter cups in and just judging by how i see this on top i like my cookies to be over the top so i'm going to add in the chocolate chips as well now the reason why i chose the hershey's kisses is that they are pretty big compared to these and they're also milk chocolate so it blends in better with the uh peanut butter cups and i'm gonna get these mixed in this is best done with a wooden spoon and you're just kind of turning it you don't want to crush all the peanut butter cups because they're a little more delicate than chocolate chips and you just want to do it until it's evenly blended make sure you get the stuff up right from the bottom we need every cookie to have a good amount of chocolate in it cookie dough is done i'm going to put this in the fridge just to firm it up a little bit and it makes it easier to scoop and the cookies take a little while longer once the butter hardens so you end up with a the cookie spread out less i've used a medium scoop to scoop these out and and then i just rolled them into balls just to make them smoother looking and i'm going to bake these for 10 minutes in the 350 degree fahrenheit oven so if you take them out and they look a little unremarkable remember they taste amazing but if you just want to get so they look like they're full you can just put a couple chocolate chips a peanut butter cup and dress them up a little bit we're just going to let these cool for a couple of minutes and then put them on a rack to cool completely the cookies are done i have to admit we may have eaten a few already we couldn't resist a neighbor stopped by and had a couple and they loved them as well so these are going to be a real big hit this christmas give them a try don't forget you know if make your cookies and then shove some extra chocolate chips in the top to just make them like over the top chocolaty looking and people will love them so thanks so much for watching don't forget to check out our recipes playlist for all of our recipes and until next time keep on baking", "t2TEaEwvxdQ": "so the recipe title was not Clickbank whatsoever we have kiddo peanut butter cups and Aikido Cup copycat in this video today so you're gonna get two recipes one video you're gonna fold view with me making the recipe and the recipe itself and then you'll turn around and get a close-up of the recipe for keto cup copycat and there couldn't in a close-up of me too there is a pretty destination of you two he's holding me now you know I'll do for endo so what we're going to start out with it's gonna start with the keto peanut butter cup let's go straight into it so what we have here is we have two different ways to make it I'm going to make the keto peanut butter cup for you and then I'm gonna make the kiddo cup copycat for you as well so we're gonna start out with the peanut butter kyoka this is gonna have Lilly's chocolate chips know what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually put half of the chocolate chips in here and then I'm gonna add the other half I'll explain why I'm actually doing it so what I'm doing is double boiler style the reason you're doing this is because see if you want a Remo chocolate you don't want to get it too too hot because it's chocolate actually has crystals within it and when you actually melt it you break you break some of those crystals down so you lose some of them so you don't have and then you bring the other half back into its Hillary to reintroduce those crystals in order for it to remote again it's toughest design to melt in your mouth not in your hand if it melts in your hand it wasn't temper correctly now if you want to get technical you could temper it the correct way by getting it up to a certain temperature and then bringing it back down but I don't really have my handy-dandy at the moment right now and this is probably one of the most spook proof ways to do it sadly the catch is what this method is it's not completely Aero proof of course if you get the chopper too hot then you have you know it will never fall I'm back right again I can't remember exactly what the correct name was but it's not actually smart to put it on top of boiling water because the boiling water what two-stage thing is it's never gonna to with the stage thing it's going to give way way to it he never on top of boy I'm warning you have a thermometer then that's fine because you're gonna watch the temperature is rising I'm gonna do now is simply place the other half of the chocolate chips in there and let the heat from the Oh from the melted chocolate melt the new chocolate chips so they'll get those crystals back in there we're gonna fill the cups up and then we're gonna grab my peanut butter when I make the other half I'll actually do a lot of close-ups so you can actually see what I'm doing speaking of the other half when I drop in their six you guys watching my video I'm gonna drop a few low dives in there for you okay just a few tips with you look tips all right so just chopping that's pretty much melt it down now so we've got dad and the method I'm using right now all I did was simply have boiling water took it off the boiler set it up here and I set the dish on top of it so what I'm going to do now is a half a teaspoon in each bottom of these silicone molds I have a teaspoon it's something because all I want to do I just want to call the bottom I don't need super thick chocolate coating the bottom and then I'm gonna stick in the refrigerator so I'm sorry we're gonna coat the bottom I stick it in the freezer know that this is a little thick we can give it a little tap well it does spread actually a little a little bit there's nothing I said it's not super higher so it's not super loose there we go and when we stick this in the freezer like two to three minutes is more than enough to three minutes all we just need to do is four and all we just need to do Jesus all that needs to happen is you just want to get nice top hardness for when you put your peanut butter up there and it doesn't slow down to the bottom now I'm only doing three here but just rest of me makes six so I'm gonna pop these in the freezer for two to three minutes well I'm doing that here's my peanut butter now it's been a refrigerator while I was melting the chocolate and preparing for the video and so let's say I guess fifteen 20 minutes so this is it's best to go ahead and make this ahead of time if you're choosing to do the peanut butter when I get to the coconut butter I'll talk about that more when it gets there but anyway speaking of the peanut butter the reason I wanted to put it in the freezer was I wanted it to harden up so it'll have less spread when I put it inside of the cup you know as now it's super thick because it's cold and it has a tablespoon of pirate sweetener in it now will for you forewarn you if you go ahead and taste this with just a PAP tablespoon of powdered sweetener your you will get a cooling effect so your best way so I think that what a I'm sorry your best way to counter that is to use either a tablespoon of powder ariados or xylitol or either you can use one teaspoon of power sweetener with a little stevia but notice if you don't use much power of sweetener it's not gonna harden up as much now if you got if you can have that peanut butter loaded with sugar then you know you don't have these problems but you know natural peanut butter it tends to you know fight the power now to what both of these recipes the macros aren't exactly they're not wrong but they're not correct well I I guess if they're not correct that means they're wrong too so the macros when it comes in it the macros are actually higher than the actual cups are and that's due to it's hard to break down how much I'm putting in each cup now I know if I use a half a cup of chocolate and I put the cup of peanut butter I'll have enough to make six but there may be there's definitely gonna be some left above both of them there may not you know it's just it's just due to the nature of what's being made it's hard to make it exact I've been talking that little short time time to bring the cup side of the cup side of a chocolate the cup side of the freezer I'm gonna fourth the tea spoon I must start with that now and the direction has a half a teaspoon that's if you want to make them super thick where am I gonna make them extra thick right now a heaping teaspoon and for it being cold you know it gives you the ability to actually spread it around the coconut butter ones you don't have this problem because it's easy they get hard and I simply use a cookie cutter to cut them I really do apologize for the weird angles but I'm told and the table is like all the way down there and with this particular recipe I couldn't sit down and do it anybody having this one I just want to see how long she was gonna happen I think it's gonna overrun don't ya see it's over running it's gonna take home look at the side yeah so you got you got 1/4 teaspoon of each so we're gonna grab my 1 teaspoon this time well come in we're gonna top DS off now if you run into a situation where you feel like you might need a little more chocolate that's fine it differed in their class say that it's not gonna cause any harm whatsoever that have that half a teaspoon is way too much by the time this video comes out I'm gonna I would have already changed it in the recipe card and a little technique you can use it's placed the peanut butter in the middle and then work around to get to the center so that way everything is uniform as it should be you know cuz you don't you want it you want your peanut butter cup to be pretty I mean it may not have to be now if you want what you also can do is you can use these to make the coconut butter ones I have a few extra disk and I still have some chocolate left now I'm gonna use those real fast the peanut butter ones are definitely gonna be harder to get like super neat simply because the Lilly's chocolate chip is much thicker and using the Lilly's chocolate chip you're gonna have a higher carb count that's why I recommend it using the chocolate and I will move on to that after those come under free after those come out the freezer and we'll do a taste test of both so let's head over we're not hit over I'm still gonna be here but let's head to the cute little cup copycat right now now that we're making a keto cups copycat this is gonna be much different actually what you're gonna do is you're still gonna melt the chocolate down and what you wanna do is you want to get either a hundred percent chocolate or you want to get something like your lip Lintz 90 percent or maybe even you can use Lilly's chocolate bar whatever chocolate a good choice what I suggest for the most authentic one is a little bit of a hundred percent cacao or chocolate with the cacao butter or cocoa butter because there are five ingredients in the keel cover us and we're using four MCT oil I don't I don't know what I put in it I guess because of marketing MCT oil like it's crazy now so you want to start out as I said earlier with the keto peanut butter cups you want to start out by simply melting down the chocolate half of it and then you want to bring in the other half now if you want to add in a cocoa butter you do half of that which is one ounce so you do half of one ounce which is a half ounce anyway I don't know why I just don't say it from again anyway you do a half an ounce of cocoa butter with a whole ounce of chocolate and then you melt those two down after those melt down you're gonna melt them down the same way now if you're using a microwave or the method segment that I'm using make sure you don't get it too hot that the chocolate itself if you just have enough heat to it it'll allow itself to milk you don't want to get it super hot because you want it to form back to where it's supposed to be now if you want to temper it temper it to perfection you can use a thermometer there's resources all over the internet what temperature you should be it don't quote me but aside I want to say it's like 115 now for temperature with a couple times before but I got to a point we was just so tedious I'm just like you know let me not get it so hot but a coconut butter but a coconut butter what you want to do is simply have 1/4 of a cup of cocoa butter and you want to be using monk fruit this is what they use in Aikido cups recipe monk fruit now when they use powder or they use liquid I'm not sure but I'm almost willing to bet they use liquid know as far as sweetener you can range from 1/8 of a teaspoon to 1/4 of a teaspoon I prefer 1/4 of a teaspoon if you just taste it now by yourself it's gonna it's gonna taste really it's gonna taste overbearing it's probably gonna be a little too much but when you proceed that bitter chocolate on top of it it's gonna taste perfect now to mold these you're gonna use the same method 1/2 a teaspoon but see this one this one's super easy because the chocolate is melted down much much much more if you melt the lilies that much I would definitely definitely recommend using Octomom if you melt that much you're not gonna know what the temperature is but with this by being a hundred percent cacao and throwing that cocoa butter in it you're definitely gonna have a nice smooth melt down stick it in the freezer two to three minutes now while in the freezing it that two to three minutes the only thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take it and we're going to use a cookie cutter and we're gonna press help our circles that we're gonna use for our filling so I have a cup right here this is the cone and this is my feeling literally it's it's all right in the middle this I don't know if I can give up the example I don't know if I can get a good example of that but a cyst directly right in the middle - a lot of chapel to be able to go over theirs and this is what you want because this is gonna give you perfection so we're gonna drop those in there and then they're gonna take one teaspoon and we're gonna level it off and we're gonna smooth it out you don't even have to shake it if you don't want to well you shouldn't have an issue with it should just sprout all by itself but you may have to give it a little shake you know sometimes I have no you can leave these out at room temperature to allow them as a set or me personally I like to stick them in the freezer because I'm usually ready to eat right with it if you want to use that coconut butter inside of the lilies that's perfectly fine as you saw I did it earlier and what I'm gonna do is we're gonna sit down and we're gonna taste them both together whoa look at--look deja vu going on right here I haven't been here in a minute all right so I have I don't know which one is which I know these two are the peanut butter and what these two is the coconut butter and once the peanut butter I use earlier let's see that's brick and a half see we got that's not happening all right this is coconut butter this is coconut butter I'd say this one I checked on the frozen yoga it has same bitterness to it I do warn you guys about that the Kido cups are very very bitter chocolate they have some that are sweetened as some that are unsweetened but when it says sweet doesn't the chocolate still not sweetened just a coconut butter a sweetness out of it so I do warn you about that so if you're a fan of fleeting chocolate yeah you're gonna hate those the coconut butter Oh both of these are coconut butter you know this one gets a little chopper to another effect now this one is it's pretty much perfect the peanut butter layer isn't as perfect as this is right here well how did you have us you have a cutout like you did with the other one no the Kido club hopping cabin down was definitely on point but I do form on you with the kid old peanut butter cup I've seen people say Reese's and stuff like that you can make the peanut butter taste very similar to the recess cup peanut butter but it's never identical but when you add this child into it there's no comparison oh I don't know I don't know I guess it's just I guess this is a gimmick like it's impossible to do without carbs like don't learn like I really feel sorry but that's my own back heel cups now come on way home I just pop

Patty's Day guys we wanna adopted her from the Humane Society so she's a rescue dog but she's super sweet she's still learn to get used to Adi and Worf but uh she's getting there she'll get there

done a good girl are you just are you just don't light up are you just don't like done alright guys so let's see how these peanut butter cups are they should be all cooled now we'll just cut them up and they're all done they're all done so the whole part of the parchment papers that make it really easy to get out spread the paper a little bit and then cut it up I usually cut these into about 16 bars so I just cut it in half and then those halves in half and just continue so it makes a good amount of bars and I did the macros on that I'll post them in the description but it comes out to about 1.3 carbs per bar and about 8 and a half grams of fat per bar so they come out super easy and super good there you go guys make 16 bars storm in the freezer low carb delicious treats easy to make I'm addicted to these things and hope you guys like them let me know what you think in the comments below this is my own recipe so if you guys liked it go ahead and feel free to share it like the bid pass

to eat a Reese's", "LzPH_h0oAgE": "[Music] meeting on this now some of you know I enjoy the Reese's and when there's like clearance on candy I always try to grab as much as possible but sometimes you can't really get the Reese's because these are not readily available or the funds aren't there sometimes you have to make do with the generics or the somewhat not exactly the best but it's there now I'm sure some of you will be even had some of those Butterfinger peanut butter cups which they're acceptable but just not that great I mean I mean I've had them in whatever but there's just something about the peanut butter and chocolate but what happened I was at Ollie's yesterday and those are you don't know all just like a big lots but probably better I think I may have mentioned about that but either way asabi yes peanut butter cups made by Palmer and yeah they're probably going to be like em again it's not going to be that great well you gotta realize Palmer has been around for a good long time now as almost pair of shoes but they are still make their candy name USA right there and and Pierre and Reese's Cups while some of them are still being at Hershey Pennsylvania the mini ones are made in Mexico which does not seem too taped as good so yes I mean and since this is probably made in Reading Pennsylvania you can look up the information there you can google it if you want to and what I paid no crap I took a product ID off but so it's like maybe less than two bucks so what I'm going to do I can open now the fail oh there we go we're going to I'm going to try one and let you know my opinion and see gold I mean it looks like a Reese's but probably the best thing about it is you don't have the paper because you just want a nun on them but taking off the paper just it's work that it's necessary so means here's what it looks like it's just more of the chocolate and peanut butter the reason maybe that's a good thing because I actually like now I may consider buying a bag of these and a bag of the Reese's miniatures and have like a blind taste test but then again people are going to complain that maybe it's better well they are and that actually sees it's just sometimes when you can't afford Reese's you've got to have the next best thing and this is actually pretty decent I mean Palmer Keynes is actually pretty good I actually like them so yeah pretty much an unbiased review of the Palmer peanut butter cups night owl all these for about two bucks and all that so just what I sent one over there's a receipt for watching [Music]", "0HsEZL5_yAk": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate caramel cups and this is what they look like these are little chocolate cups made with semi-sweet and milk chocolate and then inside we have a creamy smooth caramel so the first thing we need to do is to make our caramel so in a small saucepan you will need a third of a cup which is 80 milliliters 80 grams of heavy cream you may also know that heavy whipping cream and that's cream with the 35 to 40 percent butterfat content and then I'm also going to add one teaspoon four grams of salt I like to use either a sea salt or a kosher salt here nice flavor to our caramel and then I'm going to heat this on like medium heat just until it comes up to a boil now you could do this just as easily in the microwave oven but it's easier for you see if I do it here and the reason I put the salt in the cream is so it melts okay there we go take that off of the heat and then just put it aside and what I do is I just want cover it with a plate and that'll keep it nice and warm so now for caramel you will need a medium sized saucepan try to get one with a really thick bottom because that way your as we're cooking the sugar it helps prevent from not burning so you need to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan now I like to have a pair of admits and I also like to have a small bowl with some ice water just in case you know sometimes that that sugar can splatter and then you don't burn yourself at if you do then you can just put it in the cold water and then I like to wear long sleeves as a precaution as well so now what I'm going to do is put my saucepan over medium heat I want to get that the bottom of the saucepan nice and hot we are making what is called a dry caramel there's dry and then there's wet the difference is is whether you add water at with the sugar we're not adding any water we're just going to cook the sugar on its own the advantage of that is it's it's a lot faster so they get that hot okay so what you want is you put your hand not on don't touch the bottom of the put your hand like you know an inch or two it's it feels hot so you will want your I mean this is a technique so you got to kind of get to know your pot your heat source you want about medium medium-high so I'm not going to put all the sugar you will need 1 cup 200 grams of granulated white sugar total but what I'm just going to do is put a thin layer we're going to melt this sugar gradually so I'm going to melt a bit add more now the thing is about when you're doing a dry caramel you have to watch it you can't go off and do something else you have to watch it and have either a heatproof spatula or a wooden spoon and you want to kind of shake your pan kind of you want that sugar to melt evenly this is where you kind of got to get to know your pan and you know what first time it may not work so you know it's just sugar so it's it's really a technique that you have to learn now I'm my sugar melts first in the center of my pot so what I'm doing is gently moving the other sugar from the outside into the center you can stir it but just stir it gently if you stir too much you'll get big chunks of sugar which is fine but you're going to have to let those melt down and take a little longer now the important thing is you may have to adjust your heat you do not want your caramel to burn if it burnt if your sugar burns you're done you got to start over so just keep that in mind so as you can see so you put a put in you melt it - it's like all melted translucent which mine is now just about and then you just sprinkle on some more and you keep doing that now you may if it melts too quickly your sugar you may have your heat a little too high adjusted down because you don't you know you don't want it to burn conversely if it's taking forever then turn your heat up so I'm going to give you like kind of a baseline I find maybe 10 15 minutes to melt this amount of sugar we don't need a candy thermometer because you're going to early by the look of your sugar as you can see I'm gently moving and I you can like I said stirred I find gently so you don't get like those big grain like clumps but like I said if you what you're looking for is it to melt now not to you don't want a lot of color as your sugar is melting we'll do that at the end once we've added all her sugar today I'm just moving it around so it melts okay so I've added all of my sugar and as you can see it's almost melted it's starting to color now we're looking for that watch carefully we're looking for it to be a deep like almost reddish brown the law the deeper the color the more the caramel flavor but of course you don't want to take it too far cos and it'll burn and then you don't want the burnt taste so you know again it's about technique kind of the more you do it the the braver you will get you'll push that and make it a deeper color as you can see I'm just gently during this we're almost there and you know smell it you can tell by smell and then you can also sometimes see a little bit of smoke that's usually a good sign you know where you're almost there yeah I'm happy I'm gonna that's a boat now again adjust your heat here you don't want to burn it miel conversely you don't want to take it forever so I'm gonna go with that so I'm gonna unplug that and so now we have our cream and I now be careful because this is going to sputter smoke and I'm going to add maybe a 1/4 of my cream and stir vigorously at this point you know there y'all and add a little just keep adding it stir stir stir stir now if you find and I have had this you get big clumps of sugar do not panic just turn your heat on low and let those lumps dissolve it may take in up to five minutes on low heat if you have any sugar lumps but it's not wrecked there is a tendency to panic but don't so there we have that and now what I'm going to add make it nice and creamy and smooth is four tablespoons 55 grams of room-temperature butter you don't want cold butter here and I've cut it into chunks so it'll melt easily into our caramel and I'm also going to flavor it you know brown sugar and that vanilla so I'm at adding one teaspoon four grams of pure vanilla extract or you could use the pure vanilla bean paste as well here and then you get the little seeds so this is really as you can see it is very fluid as it's hot and but as Kara this caramel cools it will thicken so we want it obviously it's a little too thin for us to make our chocolate caramel cups so what I'm going to do is just pour it into a container and let that cool down to room temperature now the good thing about this is you can actually store this in a covered container up to a week at room temperature and then because it you know depending on what you're going to use it for I mean you can pour it over your ice cream or something you may have to reheat it so it is a great all-purpose caramel it's good for this it's good to you know as a sauce it's good to just eat on to the eat out of the container with a spoon so and I'm just going to cover this and let that cool down and then when we come back we will make our chocolate caramel cups so now for our chocolate you will need a saucepan a simmering water and then in a heat proof Bowl I'm using stainless steel I have six ounces 180 grams of semi-sweet chocolate and 6 ounces 180 grams of milk chocolate and then I've just cut it into pieces now you want to use a chocolate that you just kind of like eating on its own and if you I mean I like a combination of the semi-sweet and the milk you could just use like all semi-sweet or even a bittersweet if you prefer that with your caramel so you know you can experiment with that a bit and then what I'm adding is a 1/2 a tape tablespoon 7 grams of either a shortening or you could add butter and that just helps to make the chocolate more fluid and helps it keep it shine because we are not tempering the chocolate here so now I'm just going to put this over the simmering water and melt it until it's nice and smooth okay so our chocolate has melted take it off the heat and then what I like to do is such a large bowl I'm just going to pour my chocolate into a smaller bowl find it easier to do our next step so you will need this this amount of chocolate makes about 24 miniature caramel cups so you will need a mini I guess mini muffin pan this is like 24 and then I've lined mine with just paper liners you can use the foil liners if you want and of course you could scale this recipe up or down if you want to make lots and lots for Christmas or something so now what I do I know you can pipe it for those people I will get comments but I prefer just to spoon it in with my little tea spoon I find you want to cover the bottom of the liners with a layer of chocolate I find for this about 1 teaspoon I am using the tea spoon you can pipe so just pour it in there like so and my last one oh so now what I do just kind of gently shake the pan to even out that chocolate looks good and now what I'm going to do is put this into the refrigerator for maybe ten minutes I just want to set that chocolate and then we can put the caramel on top of the chocolate once it's firm so maybe in about ten minutes okay so now the chocolate is hardened so we're going to put the caramel on now this caramel I made yesterday so as you can see it's really become nice and firm you can give it a good stir like I said you can store this for about a week at room temperature so so that's what it becomes nice and firm so again I'm using a teaspoon you can pipe if you would prefer to do that so take like I said about that amount put it try to put it in the center of your little cup well so kind of squish it down and then what I do I'll just show you what I do for each one and then what you're going to do is take maybe a little more that depends you want to cover all of that caramel up with your melted chocolate so maybe it'd take a little more than a teaspoon like that and then it usually our way to the end you would shake it again because you want to have a nice level top as you can see that looks pretty good so that's what you do for each one what my teaspoon okay so on my last one here put the caramel and chocolate on top now I'm going to have a little more a little chocolate left over so what I'm going to do so I only have one pan I'm going to chill these and then once serve chilled I could take them out of the pan and store them and then I'll make a few extra so I do have some caramel also left over so there we go so you want to make sure you cover the caramel and then just kind of shake your pan to even it out and if you see it's not quite level then add a little more chocolate so like I said I'm going to put these into the refrigerator to chill until firm that you know maybe about 20 minutes and then you can take them out and store them so I do store them in the refrigerator because we didn't temper the chocolate which means if we store them at them at room temperature they would get like a white film called bloom after a day or two which we don't want so store them in the fridge or the freezer that you can store them so great do ahead for Christmas people would love to get these as a food gift so I made these yesterday and you can either take them like I have here take the paper off peel it off or you can just I normally when I store them I store them like in the paper so there you have it you have the two layers of chocolate with that wonderful caramel in between that chocolate that combination of the milk and the semi-sweet chocolate is so rich and creamy and then of course caramel in between it's just a perfect perfect combination you know try these they are so good and until next time I'm Stephanie to escape joey baking calm you", "-hPlvdBss6c": "what's up guys welcome to this video today is going to be a bit of a different video uh because i will be just reviewing remington james's reese's peanut butter dairy queen blizzard because i heard good things very good things about about that so i have high expectations and me personally i am a peanut butter guy so yeah i think i'll enjoy that and i'm doing this video because i like remington james i love his videos i follow his channel and i tried some of these some of his cooking videos or recipes so i'm very excited about this and i want to support him and me doing this video just reviewing his his recipe is for me i think it's it's a way to support him and yeah also i want to give you my honest opinion my honest rating on this recipe so yeah i think that's it for now and i'll see you in the kitchen when we make the shake okay guys welcome to the kitchen so i've got scale blender thingy and we'll start with the ingredients so i also have a book right here i have the ingredients in here so let's start so first we will start with a scoop of protein i'm using ghost nutter butter because i think it's gonna taste amazing in this recipe so yeah there is one scoop okay let's scoop next ingredient is he uses bb fed i don't have pb fit i have bb2 which is same thing so 16 grams of powdered peanut butter okay next thing he'll add sugar-free fat-free pudding mix he also uses vanilla i don't have vanilla i have butterscotch but it i don't think it matters that much you know i love butterscotch he he says that you can use like whatever one so pitch everyone so yeah i'm using butterscotch so seven grams of pudding mix perfect next thing we will use is zero calorie sweetener just five grams okay and next thing i think the most important thing is xanthan gum just three grams it will make it thick it's two three grams okay now the next thing is some zero percent blind greek yogurt 85 grams okay and last ingredient is cashew milk or almond milk uses almond milk i'm using cashew milk but unsweetened vanilla 65 grams and now that's why it's called reese's peanut butter cup blizzard because we will be using some risky pups so i have to go to store to buy them but yeah i'll measure 39 grams and then crush them so i'm using a separate ball okay i have it right here now i just need to crumble them or crush them i don't know i don't wanna i don't wanna make a mess so i don't know i will crush them somehow and then get back okay i have them right here now i'm just gonna just stamp on it okay that's crushed enough now i will transfer them into a bowl okay got it right here now we need some i don't know three quarters into a blender so i'll measure that oh no just yeah 27 grams in a blender and now final thing is some ice he doesn't specify the amount of eyes but in the last video he said uh 300 grams of ice i think i'm gonna use that too for pumpkin spice pizza so i will use 300 grams of ice okay 300 grams quite a lot of ice and now what we need is to blend okay we just have to scrape some of these sides and i think and now continue okay i think it's that's it now we will just transfer that into a bowl okay transfer that to the bowl now what's left just put the remaining reese's stuff on top yeah that's it okay guys i heard the idea i will give you a taste test i already tasted that you know when i was cleaning the blender so now i'll taste that with the reese's pieces on top so okay this is how it looks let's give it a taste test yes it's wow that is so good oh my god seriously i'm not i'm not joking if this is not there like for the amount of calories which i will put on the screen this is like it pays like i don't know 1500 calories and it's barely 500. oh my god okay so rating for me important thing is taste which is 10 out of 10 uh calories well higher income let's say calorie calorie wise seven eight out of ten it's not like very very low calorie but also it's not high so i think for the amount of calories it has and you know taste wise it's amazing i i will give them eight out of ten calories and macros yeah they are perfect you know it's high in protein low very low in fat and just carbs i don't know moderate higher carbs but yeah just amazing and lastly will it satisfy my cravings and keep me full 100 100 this will keep me

description below check out the remington james channel and yeah like this video subscribe to the channel and i'll see you in the next one bye guys", "gDUEL-fEt48": "what's up guys it's clarissa may so do you guys ever have some sweet tooth cravings and you're tempted to indulge in some sweet and salty junk food every once in a while today I'm going to give your food a makeover so you can have your cake and eat it too the only difference will be that everything that I make will be a healthier alternative but I promise you guys it will be just as good you're watching save my sweet tooth I don't watch you guys but I always have this late-night craving for chocolate and peanut butter but I kind of don't want to devour the whole entire bag of Reese's peanut butter cups so I decided I would make myself a healthier alternative for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that's healthy but still just as good as races so let's get started the ingredients for the chocolate shell are six tablespoons of melted coconut oil two tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder and two tablespoons of maple syrup to make the peanut butter filling you're going to need 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter 1 tbsp melted coconut oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and one-and-a-half tablespoons pure maple syrup in this pool right here we're going to be placing 6 tablespoons of melted coconut oil next we're going to be adding 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and then we're going to finish it off with 2 tablespoons of pure maple syrup so we're going to whisk all of these ingredients together and make sure that they're properly mixed and combined while you're mixing this you might notice that it's a little bit watery but don't worry we're going to be putting it into this baking pan right here and then put it in the freezer so it'll harden right out so make sure that you don't fill your baking pan holes the whole way because you've got to leave room for your peanut butter filling and also all your chocolate that's going to top it you want to make sure that you save about 1/4 of your chocolate because once we put our peanut butter in we're going to want to add some chocolate later as well so I'm just going to put this chocolate in the freezer while we make our peanut butter filling so it'll start to harden up next we're going to be making the peanut butter filling and we're going to be combining 1 tbsp of melted coconut oil with one teaspoon of vanilla extract right here and then we're going to add one and a half tablespoon of maple syrup and then of course you can't have a peanut butter filling without some peanut butter and then I'm going to mix all these ingredients together okay so now I've got all my peanut butter mixed up I'm just gonna go check my shells in the freezer and make sure that they're hard now that my shells are hardened I'm going to be topping them off with this delicious in the first filling but now that I've added my peanut butter filling I'm gonna be putting these in the freezer for an hour or overnight if you want to have them tomorrow okay so I just brought these out of the freezer they look amazing and if you guys want to add a second layer of chocolate to the top you can totally do that so they look more like traditional Reese's but I like mine this way so I'm going to try them and see how they are oh my gosh they're so good they taste just like Reese's hmm they're perfect they seriously tastes just like Reese's you could add more chocolate if you wanted to to the top this is awesome too because you know exactly what you put in them and they're a healthier option let me know what junk food you guys want me to save your sweet tooth from next and be sure to give this video a big thumbs up while you're at it don't forget to subscribe to awesomenesstv and I'll see you guys next time bye", "IVPMsODdQo0": "today we are going to make a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup lava cake get in here guys lava cake let's make it we usually just get peanut butter that's 100 percent peanuts that's all we look for like how liquidy that is that'll work fine when we make this cake you can either put a scoop of peanut butter right in the middle just like right out of the jar or if you want to make it better and pack as much peanut butter as possible into the middle you're going to want to do one of these this is a frozen disc of peanut butter so we poured peanut butter into a cookie cutter this is a cookie cutter this is needed if you want to maximize the amount of peanut butter in the center of the lava cake not totally mandatory you can just spoon in some peanut butter to the center of the lava cake but if you want to go hard and you want your lava cake totally filled with peanut butter you need some kind of vessel to form the peanut butter we set it on a piece of parchment paper and let it freeze for about an hour you could do a saran wrap ball or something to get creative with it oven is preheating to 400 degrees now we're going to get our dry ingredients together we need two teaspoons of coconut flour now this is for the chocolate cake two tablespoons of erythritol and people always ask can you use swerve can you use powdered stevia yes you can just look up the substitution ratio one tablespoon of cocoa powder the good stuff and a quarter teaspoon of baking powder then just mix that all together once that's pretty evenly mixed we're going to start working on the wet ingredients so to start the wet ingredients we are going to melt baker's chocolate and butter together this is two tablespoons of butter and one ounce of baker's chocolate 100% unsweetened chocolate microwave so that was 40 seconds in the microwave the butter melts the chocolate doesn't really melt but once you mix it around chocolate will start melting it's looking good now we're going to add some cream tbsp actually let's throw the stevia in first five to seven drops of this stevia liquid stevia one other tip guys is you might want to add a little bit of sweetener to the peanut butter if you like your stuff super-sweet cuz it's just peanut butter so if you want to add a little sweetener to it that'll make the whole dish sweeter I like mine not that sweet though now let's add a tablespoon of cream and an egg you want to mix it right away so it doesn't turn into a scrambled egg so there we have the wet ingredients complete now and it's time to start adding in the dry let's go with half the dry first a little more than half mix that together really comes together into a nice brownie batter consistency add the rest that's pretty much what you're looking for this is a springform pan this is a springform pan guys that's what we're going to use to cook this Reese's lava cake this is a ceramic bowl not very clean if you don't have a springform pan you can try using a ceramic bowl it just might not pop out as well you'll have to just like spoon it out which is also good I'm going to grease the pan I'm just going to use a little coconut oil spray use whatever you want though you can use like butter let's get our peanut butter disc out and this is a technique I came up with it's called the warming embrace technique to get the peanut butter out of here you basically touch it kinda sensually and you just rub your hand around it and it starts to melt it starts to melt a little just from your body heat if you use like a bowl or something to form this you can dip it in a little bit of hot water too then it should just pops right out now look at that guys that is how you gem as much peanut butter as you can into the lava cake also I'm just going to let you guys in on a secret the one in the photograph we use this bigger size it's a little bit bigger and that fit into that was like pushing the limits though we're going to add half the batter in press it out a little then we're going to put in our peanut butter disc now pour the rest of the batter on you got to kind of form it by hand get it how you want we're going to throw this in for 13 to 15 minutes and it'll be perfectly lava ish in the middle check on it at 13 just in case to see if it's cooked too much it'll be a little shaky in the middle and cooked on the edges that's when you know it's done we'll show you when we take it out all right guys so the next door neighbor's fire alarm is going off it's not ours we promise ignore it let's see what we got here it's been 13 minutes a little too wobbly still give it two more minutes let's go see what the fire alarms about somebody's smoking the reefer it's been another minute and a half I'm going to take it out now check that out see how it's a little wobbly there that's what you want alright guys we are now going to try and get this out this is the tricky part okay that seems like it worked this is the moment of truth Oh baby no peanut butter exposure we're good yes okay here we go all right guys so here's the lava cake we cut into it so we could do the intro and put that at the start of the video but look at that look how lava you that is so much lava let me try this this is like my favorite thing of all time chocolate peanut butter that's my fave peanut buttery you know what this cake reminds me of did you guys ever see the Disney Pixar short story I lava you we thank God we love this cake so much peanut butter if you guys wanted to be super deserty I would add a little sugar erythritol stevia to the peanut butter mixture that's all there is to it guys a little bit involved you can really make this a lot simpler if you want with just not freezing the peanut butter basically just throwing everything in a ramekin and baking it but super good make the lava cake that's all guys it's been real I love it you [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "0T9XQlzuRiQ": "[Music] welcome back to my channel it's Brittany from eating bird food and I'm so excited you're here because we are making peanut butter cups so if you know me you know that I love chocolate peanut butter anything it's my favorite dessert combo absolutely adore it and Reese's peanut butter cups were always my favorite growing up well today I'm going to share how to make a healthier version with only five simple ingredients so all you need is chocolate chips I love using dark chocolate chips from Lily's they are sweetened with stevia so there's less sugar and less carbs we're also going to use a little bit of coconut oil to kind of spin that out we're gonna use peanut butter maple syrup or honey to sweeten up the peanut butter mixture and then if you want you can add flaked sea salt on top you don't have to so that ingredients optional so let's hop right in I'm going to show you how to make these start by adding chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small bowl and then microwaving until the mixture is melted and smooth then spoon mixture into a lined muffin tin until you cover the bottom of each liner and place in the freezer in another bowl add your peanut butter coconut oil honey and sea salt and microwave for about 15 to 20 seconds pour peanut butter mixture evenly over each cup then place back in the freezer for a few seconds to set then bring it back out and pour remaining chocolate over each cup using just enough to completely cover the peanut butter layer at this point you can sprinkle a little flaked sea salt on top of the chocolate if you want then place the tin back in the freezer for about thirty minutes to an hour to set completely and then store these in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve so that's it it is that easy to make your own homemade peanut butter cups that are absolutely delicious I can't wait for you to try them and when you do please come back and leave me a comment down below letting me know how they turned out for you and as always please hit like and subscribe and I will see you at my next video [Music]", "MB3AON6JPaM": "hey guys it's Andy I have a sweet treat that you are going to love I make this all the time I'm getting ready to make up some more so I'm going to share it with you of how I do it it's Ricci cups home a greasy cups but this is a healthier version so you don't have to feel guilty whenever you're eating it creamy on the inside and got the crunchy chocolate layer on the outside I'm so good I'm going to show you how to make these you're gonna need four ingredients and the four ingredients are peanut butter this is a natural peanut butter that's what you want to make sure and get honey these are two main things this is a roll honey make sure you get raw honey because raw honey is full of antibodies and nutrients you need coconut oil this is optional but you only use a teaspoon it puts some healthy fat in there and also when it gets cold then it gets solid and if you need chocolate I use dark chocolate you can use milk chocolate if you want dark chocolate has a lot more nutritional value to it so first thing you're going to need is one cup of peanut butter now I said that I use a natural peanut butter all the ingredients I bought are from Aldi but you could get a natural Jif peanut butter or a natural Skippy peanut butter this is the kind of sits on the shelf it's not the kind that you put in the refrigerator that you have to stir so you just take one cup of peanut butter and you stick it down into your bowl and next you need to put in your honey now raw honey I'm gonna take that little actually raw honey is what I use because then it's not a process honey that kind that you buy in that cute little bear it's not what you want basically that's just corn syrup it's all been processed down and then you don't have all the benefits of raw honey raw honey has so many good vitamins and minerals in there you can use it as a face mask you can use it in your tea or you can put it in your greasy cups so four tablespoons yes my hands are clean I just washed them right before I did this it's just easier to scoop that out with my finger out I just need to stir this up until it becomes like a thick concoction I don't need no else but what else to call but let me show you how this looks you want to just keep stirring it until you get a thick consistency that pulls away from this side but it's still really creamy Josie has been sitting at my feet just waiting to be able to lick the peanut butter it is her favorite treat and she can smell any time I pull out the peanut butter so now take the your bowl of peanut butter and honey and put it in the freezer you need to leave it in here for about 10 to 15 minutes just so it's cold enough that you can work it with your hands and doesn't stick to your fingers and now I can make up the chocolate so this is the container that I usually keep in the refrigerator all the time it's the leftover chocolate that whenever I make this I told you I make this all the time so it's the leftover chocolate I just put a lid on it and keep it in refrigerator and then add more chocolate and warm it back up whenever I want to use it for the sake of this video instead of using my dirty chocolate bowl I'm going to get a clean Bowl and show you how to make the chocolate mixture this is what I use for chocolate I bought this at all of the it's a 70% dark chocolate there spy right one two three four five bars that come in this and it's four and a half ounces so I just break up the chocolate bars and use those but if you didn't have chocolate bars you could also just use chocolate chips milk chocolate or semi-sweet 1/2 a cup is what you need to equal out the four and a half ounces or if you really like chocolate and then use 3/4 of a cup and then add your one teaspoon of coconut oil place the chocolate in the microwave and then warm it in 1 minute intervals and after 1 minute take it out and stir it and then stick it back in for another minute until it is completely melted now to assemble them so I took my cold peanut butter out of the freezer after about 10 minutes it's ready and you're just going to be able to work your peanut butter so see I can pick it up and it's not sticking to my hands I can pull off a piece I could make it into a bowl or I can form it into the Reese's Cup hobby that I'm gonna make it so tin in about ten minutes in the freezer is all that it needs just to chill it a little bit I'm just gonna put some chocolate in the bottom of each of my silicone cups this is silicone it's wonderful because then it just they pop right out nothing sticks you guys can buy these on Amazon or you could just get the singular cups you could probably try the paper cups that you'd make cupcakes and I don't know if it would stick or not I've never tried that I've only used two silicone it gets a little messy but that's okay it's chocolate it'll pop right off and then you can eat it so I put my chocolate into each of those now I just take some peanut butter and form it into a patty and stick it right down on top of each of my chocolate cups so here I'm making just a healthy resi peanut butter cup they are so good you will leave this in the freezer or the refrigerator they have to stay cold because if not the chocolate and the coconut oil will melt so I'm just sticking them in like this [Music] this will just pop right off of here I know it was messy going on but I like to get it done quickly so I'm not worried about trying it to make it perfect now I just make enough space put it in here and then leave them in the freezer for about 30 minutes or until they are hard so here they are out of the freezer nice and hard and to get them out all I do is just pop it right out and it comes out perfectly clean just like that break it open and you can see the chocolate inside the peanut butter then I just pop them all out and put them in a freezer bag and you can stick them in the refrigerator or the freezer to enjoy anytime okay guys that's it hit that like button below hit subscribe and the Belle b-side of it I have a lot more

"NDvqaz2ExZo": "what's up guys welcome back to in the kitchen with Jen today I want to show you one of my favorite dark chocolate recipes you guys know breaking in basically my boyfriend I keep my heart when my favorite recipes right here it is dark chocolate cups with peanut butter inside you can use anything you want but almond butter cashew etcetera so let's do this line a muffin tin with baking cups and melt three to four bars of dark chocolate fill each cup halfway with your melted dark chocolate next spoon in about half a tablespoon of peanut butter into each cup with the remaining melted dark chocolate fill each cup up until the peanut butter is covered in chocolate freeze for eight hours and enjoy [Music] you", "NoI_sXSNHoc": "hello everyone we are coming to you from our kitchen I am Jamie and this is Annie and she's going to be my baking assistant today so what we're going to do because it is Halloween and I don't know a single person who doesn't like ricci cups we're gonna make a healthier version of racy cops using what are our ingredients today Annie chocolate shake our feet peanut butter and coconut oil yep coconut oil and a spoon that's right so what we had to do i will show you the second part but the first part I already did because sitting on here for 10 minutes watching these hardened would be really boring so what I did is I took a muffin cups we get this a little bit closer I took muffin cups and or cupcake cups and I put them in a muffin tin and so then I took seven tablespoons of coconut oil melted it for 40 seconds and then I put 6 tablespoons of vegan chocolate Shakeology into the coconut oil mixed it up put it into these muffin tins just just a little bit and then I put it in the freezer what ork okay and then I put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes so it can harden so our next step now is we have our bottom layer of our race tea cups or not raise two cups and we're going to add some peanut butter so we're going to add two teaspoons of peanut butter to each muffin tip don't let your kids stick their fingers in the peanut butter oh okay I'm gonna do this ok so our teaspoon is dirty I'm just going to use a kid spoon alright so i'm going to use and i have a baby spoon too i don't have babies anymore but I still have their baby spoons so I'm going to put these about two teaspoons of peanut butter in each muffin tin yep just a second I don't do this quickly nobody wants to watch somebody put peanut butter in your muffin tin I'm getting peanut butter all over my hands but again it's about it's about two teaspoons in each muffin tin and then let me do this I'll show you the next step Annie can you go very carefully get the coconut oil out of the microwave so I have seven tablespoons of coconut oil in the microwave I put it in for 40 seconds and now it's liquid so Annie be very very careful two hands very careful she's making it yeah good idea all right let's leave it right there okay just like it right there on grab it so I put seven tablespoons of coconut oil into a bowl and I melted it for 40 seconds and putting this I'm almost done I only have one more putting 2 teaspoons of peanut butter that's a little bit more than 2 teaspoons but they won't tell all right into the muffin tins ok so that is done now you can also use pv2 you can also use on natural peanut butter I just used a huge Sam's Club or brand yeah all right Dave yes well first we have to get the coconut oil so I'm over here grab melton today well this is hot so let me do this one so coconut oil if you can see is solid at room temperature and when you melt it then it becomes a liquid and that's the best way to mix it with your chocolate Shakeology alright so what we're going to do is go ahead and scoop up one good shake it off a little bit shaken up okay so then we're gonna carefully pour in gonna fill up our table spoon sorry okay there's 12 okay let me try this let's speed this up three four five and six okay and as you can see i didn't really um measure it all the way just kinda so now i'm going to mix it up let me see if i can show you this little better this is melted coconut oil and seven tablespoons of melted coconut oil and six tablespoons of vegan chocolate Shakeology now if I want to try to do it quickly so nobody gets bored all right almost make sure you stir it up really really good because it can get clumpy kind of and so when you bite into your ricci cup your Shakeology cup if you're going to get that kind of gritty not mixed up taste alright video alright so now what we're going to do is we're going to pour this mixture on top of the already hardened cups not on this like a cop on something yep okay and also another really good thing to do when you put in the peanut butter is to smash the peanut butter down I did not do that so I'm going to have like some funny shaped greasy cups with that's okay they're still going to taste really good alright so once all of this is in there smash this window once all of this is in there then you're going to put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and the best way to eat these afterwards after they're in the freezer for about 10 minutes then I would take him out and put them in the refrigerator they they just taste a little better that way I hope I have enough I kind of filled that first one up quite a bit so some are going to be more chocolaty so we're going to be more peanut buttery but I mean that's not a problem almost and one and one more yeah so unless I didn't really mix it up very well some kind of mix it up as a poor all right let's put a little bit more in this one how am i doing good she's a better Baker than I am okay so this is what it looks like still liquidy at the top I mean really careful and show you a little bit not the greatest picture so I'm going to pop these in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then I'll take them out after 10 minutes put them in the refrigerator and let them set a little bit longer and then when they're ready i will post a picture of them in the comments of this video so I hope that was helpful how'd I do I did this like this are like just okay all right at least I got a thumbs up that's good enough alrighty so thanks here let's not spill this so thanks for popping on and I hope this works out well for you I will also post this recipe a little bit later in in a graphic so it's easier to follow so I hope you have a great night happy Sunday and have a great week oh and don't eat the real ricci cups eat the shakeology ricci cups they are better for you and they taste the same alright see ya bye", "kfPI5sihv68": "today kevin and i are gonna be trying three new items from quest now we've reviewed a lot of quest bars we actually reviewed peanut butter cups but it's been years ago it's been like four or five years ago there was a review up on the channel and uh so we're gonna try them again see if they've changed their recipe any these are the peanut butter cups this is a new gooey caramel uh flavor with peanuts candy bar and i have just one other quest protein bars this one is the lemon cake we found all three of these at the vitamin shop the candy bar was 249. the lemon bar was 279 and the peanut butter cups were 259 so ordinarily you're not gonna uh spend 2.49 on one candy bar when you can go spend 80 cents at walmart so there must be something to it we'll have to read maybe it has more protein we'll see so the quest this is less than one gram of sugar in the peanut butter cups 11 grams of protein one grams of net carbs that's why so this is for keto you would think so or protein pizza uh two cups is 190 calories so that's about the same as a bar it's actually quite a little less than hockey jesus got okay they have a little swirly on top [Applause] that's actually not bad it's not bad it's definitely not as sweet if i was on keto i could eat that there are so many things we've tried oh yeah that's horrible well especially those um i think they're the lilly's brand the no sugar added all those we i mean we just don't like them this is i actually really like that i actually really i taste the peanut butter it tastes like there is some sweetness to it a little bit yeah that's not as sweet as a regular candy bar of course but but yeah they're pretty good you know what i'm not disappointed in that at all i could eat that if i was on keto um you know yeah i'm just really really shocked i like the peanut butter in it because i remember years ago it was like we tried them and it's like oh i would never get that again because it seems like i haven't watched the video but it seems like maybe it was dry or this isn't like that at all this is totally different it's edible i mean would i pick that over a candy bar i personally would if you were wrong but if i was like though i would if i was on keto all the other ones we've tried before i would pick this one instead okay now this one is the new candy bar it's gooey caramel with peanuts 12 grams of protein three grams of net carbs stupid one gram of sugar so that's why you're paying so much for this so this one it looks like a pretty good sized bar too 210 calories [Applause] yeah that's not too bad oh it has lots of lumpy bumpy peanuts is it softer [Applause] i like the texture of that middle these are all gluten-free all three of them um that's really good that is very good it is once again it's not as sweet right as an actual real candy bar but if i was on keto i would i like that more than the peanut butter cups and i do like peanut butter well you get the texture of those added peanuts exactly i i really like i mean i like those peanut butter cups stuff i would have to buy them both and you know split it up and eat one one day and one the other day now i don't really get caramel as a flavor it's more peanut than anything but i did get some maybe a touch of cold i did get caramel but you get uh you get the the texture of those peanuts and the flavor of the peanuts that is that's really good it is good caramel wasn't like a standout flavor for me it might have been there a little bit but it's mainly peanuts yeah mostly you do there is a flavor um i think that's delicious it's good definitely if you're on if you need any of that stuff yes then go for it yes absolutely they are a little expensive but most of that stuff is i'm wondering if maybe if you buy them uh online or something and not get them at the vitamin shop i'd say that again you know but the vitamin shop is more expensive um i'm wondering if you get them online for jacob yeah this is a quest a lemon cake protein bar 20 grams of protein 4 grams of net carbs 1 gram of sugar 15 grams of fiber and it is 180 calories so it's the lowest calorie thing here sometimes i have a coating on oh it has squirrels so sometimes people um do these all kinds of different ways microwave them toaster oven them all kinds of ways we're just trying it regularly in our videos you want to hold that up in our videos we have many times we've cut it in half and we'll try half of it uh heated in the microwave and half of it unheated just to tell you which way is best this is so fresh and soft though unless you just like it warm i like the flavor though some of the things you have to watch out for that it's not chemical like a cleaner this one's actually really nice i like it too it is a nice lemon it's like a dessert it's a dessert lemon um a lot of protein bars too it they're overwhelmingly that protein flavor which really bugs me to death that has just the slightest hint of it for me but not bad at all and it's not grainy so i don't really get a really grainy feel texture no that one's actually a good relationship you know the better that's one of the better questions yeah i mean there's a lot of them that you like uh but that that is that's one to add to it uh so yes that's if you like a dessert type lemon flavor you would like that so it reminds me of a lemon pudding like a little a very yes yes i i agree with you um i have to do i have to admit i am surprised all three of these were very very successful they really were now you only have enough money since they're so exposed you only have enough money to buy one um i would say the candy bar with the peanuts yeah i'm gonna say the candy i'm gonna surprise you because i know i said i like the candy bar i thought more than the peanut butter but you know what i'm gonna choose the peanut butter cups because i just i really do like that peanut butter flavor see i was going to almost pick the lemon bar but i think i would be fuller after eating the lemon bar yeah so really for me it depends on when i was eating it if i was eating it for lunch i'd pick the bar okay if i need it for a snack then i'm going to pick probably the peanut bar right but they're all all of these are good uh because we've tried a lot with protein we've tried a lot with keto we're not on keto we don't have that lifestyle yeah so i wouldn't pick any of these but we can tell you if it's good or not and so for us to say that's good yeah so if you've been without a candy bar for a while these will be really yeah you're really gonna like them so i hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "NZWoz8Y_i5Y": "what's that oh this is a name brand peanut butter guy oh that gives me a good idea what's that for we're going to be here's some things you'll be needing tin foil chocolate peanut butter philotic okay clamp entree salt weird name powder sugar what else would you call X mmm alright so here you're putting your tin foil in your plant pot ray what yeah I'm still not hundreds on that name eat what else would you call it dinner that's an old argument you want to make sure there's no gaps between the tin foil in the plastic and then you're gonna go ahead and cut some chocolate but don't be like Tyler needs a Wimpy knife get a nice big one it goes a lot faster oh those baby cuts look at me I'm big manly knife you'll be there all day anyway so I just pour it all into that Boulder and trying to get miss it's gonna be messy and there's no way to avoid it clean up really was not bad though I surprised yes turn it all into there and pot with some water in it that's more'n if you watch cooking shows like a daily it's called a double boiler of what double boiler dummbell boiled it yeah just a boiler don't boil and spin around and I sins use Nathan Anderson's patented patented spin technique cover all the sides you'll be there all day once again all the later we abandon that in just use a spoon it goes real well for this is professional but you know it got the job done you're gonna eat it anyway so yeah none of that stuff up sides and then go make your peanut butter not for the peanut butter gonna need your powdered sugar and just put crap load in a lot of peanut butter like a shovel full forget butter we use the entire jar then just mix it all together and once you get nice chalky consistency go ahead and add salt to give it a little salty flavor a little bit so you see what the powdered sugar does and get all scientific here dries out the peanut butter three from science all right then you just spread it on in there we use we made two batches two batches of peanut butter and for the trap on top and oh no no no wow this looks nice oh my goodness ah look at

just fits in the palm of my hand like this raps kind of similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which you guys are familiar with I'm sure so I'm just going to go ahead and open this so we can show you guys so I'm not sure exactly why but for whatever reason and this is a little melted and it's not hot in my house summer's over this was purchased at the store so I don't know what's going on there it doesn't look so attractive but you can see like the holes in here in here I guess that's from inserting the peanut butter maybe I'll take a bite and show you guys texture creamy peanut butter inside you know they're delicious but don't get me wrong but I feel like they're not as creamy as Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but like I said still delicious really good and if you want to have something like a little bit healthier I know I try like you know I don't want to buy Reese's peanut butter cups all the time because it's like filled with garbage and stuff if you want like just a little treat after dinner to satisfy your dark chocolate craving or chocolate craving and peanut butter definitely try this out I feel like the peanut butter texture is different compared to others like it's definitely creamy but it's almost like a mousse like we're nougat like if you guys have ever had a three bus gets here like not that it tastes like peanut butter but that's the texture is different so I mean not that that's a bad thing but just letting you guys know so overall I think they're really yummy and I think they're a great treat to have on hands and something you could feel good about because of course they're organic your trade certifies and dark chocolate is better for you than like regular milk chocolate so these are Justin's mini dark chocolate peanut butter cups organic I hope you guys try it out and love it thanks for watching", "DuM5mxdfdhw": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to be new Reese's peanut butter cups these are thins I have the milk chocolate door these were three three eight a bag at Walmart they are these Cheryl packs I have no idea if they come in smaller sizes this was the only size or Walmart had I would assume that eventually they would come out with its the candy bars like a 50 Cent's us but I know it our Walmart they like to only sell the Kinkos check now thank you they like you too likely to get those king-size bars this is not a result luck no but they're introducing the rest they are individually wrapped these look like they'd be cute for Halloween no they did they fight we'll make sure you know they're gonna put them in Halloween bags it says size or delight deliciously proportioned 100% portable and individually wrapped well that could be said of any reasons there's no record on Risa spins me time just got better there are six servings so there's about 18 in the package three pieces is 170 calories this is the regular yeah off to think the peanut butters a little creamy oh that typical because the rebel Reese's cup kind of has a grainy sugary almost I'm thinking it's because it's in that ten ball because a regular risk of you have double the peanut butter basically happen think and so you have more chance of filling that greenie peanut butter which I like I mean so we're saying granny peanut butter that's not a bad thing I don't like sugar yeah wonderful yeah but it's a drier peanut butter in the cops it's dry I truly think it's because you're not getting as much of it could be I saw like um I mean there's nothing wrong on this is a dark some calories home somebody why didn't they do these in white chocolate I'll expect to be seeing that next because those are my favorite um the darkest is the door it's very dark milk is milk the the white chocolate Reese's Cup is my very very it is like overload of sugar in that white chocolate you cannot beat that white coating so they should come out of your verus yes I hope they well if you liked our trial you'll like things it's kind of a very chocolatey remember like their special dark the person yes because I'm not used to eating at their dark chocolate and it is there is a bitterness to it it's not bad it's just if they're not taking over the peanut butter flavor it does it take it takes away from the penis so what do you think about the thins would you rather have the thicker amount of that's the biggest difference because I think people watching their calories out we're trying to our patron to people that are just watching how many carbs and all that they have it time with these you know you're gonna get a fewer of all those throats then if you eat a regular know anything about flavor on I think it's still good I think it still has a really good chocolate peanut butter what is a wonderful flavor but I would still have the regular you just know I would because I am a peanut butter fanatic and I really like the flavor of well I would like that thick peanut butter as a matter of fact I like the one I don't know what it's called I want to call it a deep dish the big cup the big cup yeah I love it I love the big cup because it has tons of peanut butter in it I love those things so truth be told I'd rather have one of those great big thick ones over any of them but I would rather have a regular Reese's Cup over these just because I want the flavor of them right here I agree I like these I like these a lot I don't like the dark one necessarily because it's I wouldn't get the dark again but we don't eat a lot of dark chocolate right but I think for a Reese's Cup it's good but it is missing it's too got a good peanut flavor but you're missing the like over the topping I think you're gonna feel like you need to eat more of these to get that peanut butter flavor that like if you bought a regular racist cuff you get to race to skip to the checkout you know I think if you ate one a package of those you would feel completely satisfied these I think you're gonna fall for before you feel like oh there's that being a better flavor that I want that you know you're gonna still have that craving unless you eat more than angry it's just like an Oreo fancy we're gonna fins oh my god they're really good but you're getting all pretty much all cookie was very very very little filling and you really don't get the feeling you get a little sweetness so that's about it they're delicious but you want more right so I got the same thing with this I think they're good but you're still missing a little bit of that peanut butter flavored chocolates pretty thick in me it's not they proportion it well they have fortunately yeah so so I hope you enjoy the if anyone sees white chocolate ones out there let me know because I only solve these two at our Walmart but I would love to try these in the white chocolate so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "EwG0JzDQcZ8": "but I'm a delicious one day many years ago tasteless chocolate and peanut butter hey that's great together you know would like this Noah you mean the guy building the Ark well but he loves chocolate and he loves peanut butter let's bring him some as soon as it stops raining and so the world would have to wait for the two great tastes that taste great together in Reese's peanut butter cups", "vXadGTFnfh4": "hi guys welcome back to my channel this week i'm going to show you how to make really nice and soft and chewy reese's peanut butter blondies so this is what they look like you can see they're really chewy in the middle and they're made with brown butter so they've got a really nice nutty taste to them we've also got some reese's peanut butter cups obviously some extra chocolate chips because you can't ever have too many chocolate chips in a blondie i think and then i've also swelled some peanut butter through them and i honestly can't wait to give these a try i'm going to show you how to make them now if you enjoy the video please give me a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to my channel and i will see you in a very short while when i'm going to take a massive bite out of this for the blondies we will need 150 grams of unsalted butter 240 grams of light soft brown sugar 200 grams of plain flour 80 grams of peanut butter 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 1 medium sized egg 100 grams of chocolate chips and 200 grams of peanut butter cups to begin with we're going to grease and flour at 20 centimeter square tin i would also recommend to put some baking paper in there just to make sure that the blondies come out nicely mine did end up sticking to the bottom of the pan quite a bit even though i put a lot of butter and flour in the tin so just to be on the safe side we also want to preheat the oven to 180 degrees c first of all we've got to brown our butter and this is what's going to give the blondies a really nice nutty taste all we need to do is bring the butter to a gentle rolling boil and then we're going to take it off the heat as soon as the butter starts getting foamy and you can see little black burnt bits at the bottom of the pan at this point we're going to take the butter off the heat and we're going to let it cool down for a couple of minutes after a few minutes we're gonna transfer the butter into a large mixing bowl and we're gonna add the light soft brown sugar to it and we're just gonna give that a quick mix then we're going to add the egg and then we want to beat a little bit of air into our blondie butter and this is going to help bake the blondies a little bit more evenly you want to set the mixer to the highest setting and then just mix for about four to five minutes until the texture is really fluffy and the color of the mixture is a little bit lighter we can also add the vanilla extract at this point after a few more minutes of mixing we can add the flour to the mixture and we want to combine this just until everything's coming together then we can also add our chocolate chips and our reese's to the mixture since i'm using mini peanut butter cups i haven't chopped them up i've also set 16 of them aside to put on top of the blondies later after everything's well combined you want to take a spatula and we're just going to scrape the bowl down and make sure that all of the chocolate chips and reese's are well distributed and then we can fill all of our blondie butter into our prepared tin it should be easy enough to spread it out with the back of the spatula make sure to push the batter right into the corners of the tin and when it's all spread out nicely we're gonna take the peanut butter and we're gonna blob that all over the top of the blondie butter then we're going to take a knife or the back of a spoon and we're going to marble the peanut butter through the blondie batter finally we're going to even the surface out again and then we're going to push the 16 mini reeses that we've left aside into the top of the batter and now the blondies can go in the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes and they can come out as soon as the skewer comes out clean this recipe is a little bit different to other blondie and brownie recipes which is why they actually have to be completely cooked otherwise they just won't have enough structural integrity and they'll just fall apart as soon as you take them out now you just want to let them cool down and then you can take them out of the tin and here you can also see my struggle with how much they actually stuck to the bottom of the tin so do use baking paper you will make your life so much easier all right then i'm so ready to try these i love love love peanut butter and i love braces so this is probably the best thing that's happened to me in a very long time oh that's so good um so they're really really soft as promised really nice and chewy and then you get the peanut butter and i've used natural peanut butter so it's a bit of a different flavor to the one that you get from the reese's and then you get the reese's with their peanut butter and some extra chocolate chips in there and it all kind of melts together in your mouth and it's just brilliant then really really tasty so good you get a bit of a crunch from the top as well that's caramelised really nicely and you really get that nutty taste i'm really really happy with these i really hope you're going to give these a go at home they're really easy to make if you enjoy the video please give me a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to my channel and i will hopefully see you very soon my next video thanks very much for watching see you later bye", "4hCbAMqaIbo": "hey guys it's alvin and welcome back to my channel so ignore the fact that i look like i'm going to my baseball game again anyway so anybody that knows me knows that i have the biggest sweet tooth probably ever and my favorite candy growing up were reese's peanut butter cups ever since i made this switch a year and a half ago to more healthier eating it's been kind of hard to curb my cravings for reese's peanut butter cups so naturally i find other alternatives fast forward to this week they must have known or they must have read my mind because trust me this stuff this kind of stuff happens to me all the time but it doesn't make sense to everyone else but it only makes sense to me quest nutrition makers of the quest cookie the quest bar they brought back this this is quest's version of a reese's peanut butter cup packet believe me when they dropped that announcement i literally almost had a freaking heart attack the fact that they have peanut butter cups in quest form which i  love quests i love their quest bars and i love their quest cookies the only thing that can make me accomplish my quest were peanut butter cups the day of that they actually announced these i actually ran over to my local the vitamin shop and sure enough there they were so that's it for this week's video we're going to go ahead and taste test these and see how they compare to the original reese's peanut butter cups so i'm freaking excited so yeah i'm gonna stop talking now shut up bobbin and let's get this video started now this video is not sponsored by quest whatsoever i genuinely just love their products so quest if you want to collab let's do it so these quest peanut butter cups actually have less than one gram of sugar per serving 11 grams of protein and one gram of net carbs the original reese's peanut butter cups 20 grams of sugar 4 grams of protein 21.7 grams that means i don't even want to do the math but holy that's just crazy all right i'm excited to try these and oh my god yo look at this they literally look just like the regular peanut butter cups like it's so cool okay i'm gonna go ahead and try these now and um cheers [Music] oh my god if you can see how delicious reese's go home you have lost the competition to quest safe to say that i'm never gonna go back to reese's i love the fact that there's no sugar in these and they literally are sweetened as the peanut butter tastes a little bit different than the original peanut butter cups because they have a little bit more oil to them and this one they barely have any oil whatsoever absolutely no sugar was used in this the only sweetener that they used was erythritol and some sucralose artificial sweeteners but nevertheless no sugars holy let me guys go i still hope you enjoyed this super freaking quick ass video on this poor review of quest nutrition if you guys like this video as always please make sure to give this video a big thumbs up and drop a comment if you've ever had any of these reese's peanut butter cups or the regular quest bars or in this case the peanut butters but yeah sorry that this video was really really freaking short because battery's freaking flashing and i'm just trying to end this video before it ends me so thank you guys so much for tuning in for this week ass video and next week's video will probably be a better one probably not but you'll have to wait and see again thank you so much for watching this week's video and until next time [Music] goodbye", "XvokgjOXoBo": "hello everyone jerry cherry pie here and i'm back with another protein snack review today i have the quest peanut butter cups just quickly let you know this is like my top two favorite protein snack it's tied with this and the optimum nutrition wafer bars the only difference is the optimum nutrition wafers have five different flavors and the quest so far only has like one of these cup type things quest does make a lot of different protein snacks and they all have really really good macros inside of them but i don't like the flavors of most their protein bars i think they're kind of bland but these quest peanut butter cups these are so amazing start off with the macros one serving is 42 grams 190 calories which is good for a little snack it's got um 20 of your total fat for the day 45 saturated fat that is a ton of saturated fat it's got 14 of your fiber which ain't bad so you're not going to be farting up a storm and it's got 22 percent of your daily protein and it has only one gram or they say less than a gram of sugar but it does have eight grams of the erythritol sugar i don't know how you pronounce it but it's like the alcoholic sugar where it just kind of slowly uh decomposes or you know breaks apart so you don't get huge sugar spikes if you have medical conditions let's get started oh also too just so you guys know i'm not faking it there was a sale recently i bought four boxes so i got three here i got one at work that i leave for snacks and then these ones i leave at home and i'll take work so people won't steal them at work now this thing is very very very amazing let me tell you uh it is dark chocolate with peanut butter and i think that was a great decision on their end because a lot of times when people try to make chocolate flavored things whether they be diet or protein flavors milk chocolate is very very sweet and it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to eat healthier and also it doesn't quite get that flavor but this being dark chocolate was a smart move because dark chocolate does have a more like a bland not bland more of a bitter kind of flavor so it was perfect for them to do this i applaud quest um it's just perfect excuse me for eating my mouth full but i love texture and food to me food isn't just flavor i love the really it's got really really thick chocolate oh excuse me so you see it's very very thick a ton of peanut butter in there and when you bite into it you just get a huge very thick crunchy chocolate to bite through and then a very smooth i mean it's it's thick but it's very smooth peanut butter no crunchiness it's almost like it melts on your tongue the ridges are very very sturdy and it gives you a nice satisfying crunch as you're biting through it and then just instantly go straight to a mushy center i love it so not only does it taste good not only is it decent for you but it's crisp on the outside soft on the inside really sticks to your mouth that's what you want on the peanut butter you want a good sticking to the top of your the roof of your mouth oh my gosh and i'm not lying when i eat this at work you can ask the guys at work they're like jerry are you okay or cause i'm doing just like i'm like just like like are you okay are you like are you getting like raped in the corner or something are you like is somebody like touching you over there but i'm saying this is really really good i almost don't want to tell anybody about this because these things are so amazing this is sort of new so i don't want people to start going on buying like crazy and making it hard for me to get it but i feel like the world needs to know about this it is oh my gosh listen nice satisfying crunch very very smooth and just makes you feel like you're eating something that's thick and filling the peanut the hard chocolate keeps it cool so you're eating it's like it's just it's like it's like little ice touching your inside of your mouth caressing it and the peanut butter sticking you really gotta work your tongue up there to get the peanut butter off you a little tongue workout and also too that's that's kind of thing about snacking so if you want something to really get your mouth going it it's like this whole entire psychological thing going so if you eat a chip you just let it go crunch crunch crunch swallow is done well you have something that you have to work with it kind of gives you a psychological feeling that you ate something fulfilling your man little surprises stuck on your tongue with that thick peanut butter i'm sorry guys i'm telling you food is an experience and if you're not enjoying your food when you're eating it you're living life wrong you're eating the wrong types of food so anyways when you have this thickness and you really have to chew into something it kind of gives you this fake feeling of you're eating something fuller you're also that's why i recommend chewing gum after you're eating because it just keep or if you're if you're um hungry just chew on something like gum because it gives you this feeling that you're eating it you know releases a saliva in your mouth and all that so you're like oh yeah i'm eating your mouth you're it's kind of tricking your stomach give me a little bit of extra edge in case you you're not quite ready to eat your main meal yet but you're kind of getting to that line where you're like oh man i feel like cheating on my diet i feel like eating that nasty you know junk food over there that's bad for my body so this does it perfect perfect price perfect macros perfect i mean perfect perfect flavor i give this five out of five stars you need to go out and buy it and then they have a sale right now if you're watching it in january the beginning of january it's like 25 off on vitamin shopping amazon you have to buy two and you get it's like buy one get one half off so it's like it technically is 25 off oh excuse me quest thank you so much for making this and i hope everyone has a great day stay tuned for more protein reviews", "3AMHw55ItcA": "hello welcome to food review UK today I'm looking at the white rhesus I guess this has a UK label on the front as I guess it was imported I don't know if we have ever had these Wow a little bit difficult to get into as well quick cut edit so when I'm into it and I've got it in my hand I'm no idea if I've actually tried these I think I must have done I don't remember doing so anyway here we go looks almost quite funny doesn't that white chocolate Reese's mmm-hmm the white chocolate goes really well surprising with with the peanut butter never bite but clue the peanut of quite overpowering anyway most difficult to see what's different but the non ones bar bear with me I'm being yelled at yeah I think the number one's kind of cut through the sweetness of the peanut whereas this always din Hans's it so it's kind of all sweet if that makes sense I'm gonna have one more tiny bite yeah there's like almost a consistent level of sweetness if that makes sense I'm really torn on what to give this to am I I'd say it's on par with the normal ones very indiscernible maybe these would get slightly more more sickly after a couple of them but yeah I find it difficult to discriminate so I'm really sorry it's gonna be the elusive 6 stars 6 out 5 another Reese's product another 6 out of 5 it seems that I'm handing them out like candy these days that's certainly not my intention you know these products are fantastic and 6y6 is do maybe we'll wait to see another 6 for a while thanks a lot for watching guys subscribe for more videos", "F4OCxceWPrE": "hey guys as you can tell we're in a new kitchen today I've actually just finished moving in to my new place it's a little bit nicer than the last kitchen I wanted to do something special for this recipe so I decided to combine two of my favorite things Reese's peanut butter cups and peanut butter and jelly so I'm giving you Reese's peanut butter and jelly cups they're pretty awesome pretty quick to make so let's get cooking first things first take out a small bowl and add in about a 1/2 cup or 48 grams of PB 2 now we're gonna add in one and a half teaspoons or 6 grams of a sugar substitute of your choice next an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and finally four and a half tablespoons of water and mix to combine you want your peanut butter to have a maple syrupy ish consistency now we're all set and ready to go build our peanut butter and jelly reasons I recommend double wrapping some cupcake papers to help ensure your candies hold their form throughout the process now give your trays a gentle spray with nonstick cooking oil and pour just enough peanut butter to cover the base of your molds now add a teaspoon of your favorite low-calorie jam to the middle of your peanut butter top your Reese's with the remaining peanut butter you have and freeze for an hour and a half or less if you like your Reese's more gooey and don't forget to lick your spatula that's gonna do for today guys I've got some Reese's to eat in fact I'm gonna try one right now oh my gum that is spawn the peanut butter is spot on Reese's peanut butter Reese's are actually kind of salty so to have an inverted Reese's and then jelly on the inside it's just so great again stop eating these I'm gonna need all y'all alright so enough about how great these are let's get to the macros every one of these is a hundred calories 14

review from YouTube's only straightedge food product reviewer today we have another request we have the fire Reese's check that out people very excited to be reviewing this I have no idea these even existed until I was left that comment below so I'm very excited who knows what these are going to taste like I love the regional Ricci cups as most people do so we're going to give these a review and as always remember if you have anything you would like read to review you got to leave your comment below and I may review your item next thumbnail now people I got the king size pack as you saw for a dollar 38 at your local Kroger very reasonable price here's what they look like it looks like just like a regular Ricci cup smells a little bit different so it's quiet of course so I don't think my ex-wife will care too much about me because she's more of a dark chocolate kind of girl if you know what I'm saying but anyway let's get right to this quiet Reese's here we go it's quite better than dark no people on that first quite recent cup it was absolutely phenomenal I can't believe how good these are how come these are not more well known where maybe they are I just don't realize it but they are absolutely outstanding as much as I love the original Ricci cups I think these are almost just as good I mean they flat-out having an awesome of flavor let's take another Ricci cup here open it up and try a hit out that was absolutely just great right so good this one's actually real fresh - so as always with three C cups the fresher they are the better they are man that is so fresh look at that excellent people I'm totally surprised how good these actually are I mean I knew it was going to be good because it's Reese's of course but these are great absolutely spectacular flavor fresh good peanut butter flavor I guess that's white chocolate or whatever it is it's absolutely spectacular also I still think a regular resi cup is better but this is very close behind of course Wow all right there's some good stuff right there people ok people the quiet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup they are an amazing candy bar no doubt about that again thanks to the person that recommended this I would never have even thought about trying it or looking for it without that recommendation so overall almost as good as a regular Easter cup they have a bit of a different flavor but I think all in all they're just spectacular 4.5 out of 5 they're almost perfect but the RACI cup is perfect in my eyes this is almost perfect so there we go guys it's like trying to choose between two hot blonde headed supermodels it's what a it all depends on your preference I guess but anyway that is the official review of the white rhesus give them a shot people if you've not already like subscribe comment

pan that is at least 3 inches high on the sides then place a circle of parchment in the bottom and then grease the inside of the pan I used some cooking spray to do this and now to make the brownie layer you're going to melt six tablespoons of butter put it in a bowl and then add one and one quarter cups of white granulated sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla stir that together until it is combined and then you are going to blend in two eggs stir that around until it's smooth then add in one cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour 1/3 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and then stir that in until it is just combined this is the brownie batter it's going to go into the bottom of your springform pan be careful when you're spreading it around so that that parchment circle on the bottom doesn't get all bunched up then bake this at 350 degrees for 25 minutes while the brownie layer is baking go ahead make the cheesecake layer that's a large mixing bowl and 2 pounds of cream cheese do not use unhappy cream cheese it might spoil your cheesecake put all the cream cheese in the big bowl and you're going to blend it together so that it becomes nice and light and smooth and fluffy and the best way to do this is to use cream cheese that's been brought to room temperature now you're going to add 5 eggs into the cream cheese add them one at a time until they're all blended in then add 1/2 cup of heavy cream or milk a tablespoon of vanilla and one and a half cups of brown sugar that's been firmly packed as well as one cup of creamy peanut butter and then continue to stir until you get a nice smooth batter take a six Reese's peanut butter cups and chop them up in two quarters and then when your brownie is out of the oven you're going to sprinkle on one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and then one cup of peanut butter chips and then sprinkle on those peanut butter cups that you've cut into quarters and just move them around so that they're equally distributed on top of that brownie layer and this brownie is just out of the oven it is still hot you don't have to wait for it to cool then pour on the cheesecake filling smooth it out and it's okay to go right up to the edge because this does not expand very much now this is going to be baked in a hot water bath so in order to keep the water out of the cheesecake you can wrap some tin foil around the bottom of your springform pan I happen to have a silicone baking dish that fits underneath that baking pan perfectly and it'll keep the water out put the springform pan right into that large roasting pan that's been filled partially with some hot water to about halfway up the sides of the pan and then you're going to bake your cheesecake at 325 degrees for ninety minutes nine zero it is a long time but that's a low heat once the 90 minutes was up I shut the oven off I cracked the door open and I let the cheesecake cool in the oven for an hour before I removed it and allowed it to cool for another hour on the kitchen counter and then I put it in the refrigerator to continue to chill now I had quite a bit of cheesecake filling left over because the springform pan I was using was only two and three quarters of an inch tall so what I did is I just threw some Oreo cookies and some peanut butter cups in the bottom of some muffin tins and I filled them up with a leftover cheesecake filling and I baked those in the oven not in a water bath just on the side at 325 degrees for about a half an hour so until they were set and just lightly brown on the top here is the completed cheesecake it's been baked and chilled in the refrigerator overnight and make sure it is well chilled before you decide to unmold it or remove the sides of that springform pan and make sure it's well chilled before you move it because you don't want to go through all this trouble and have your cheesecake fall apart on you at this point if it's well chilled that's very easy to handle I removed it from the pan I peeled off that parchment circle that was on the bottom and then I placed it on a serving plate now to decorate this you can make some chocolate ganache that's 1/4 cup of heavy cream that I put in the microwave until it was hot then I added a cup of chocolate chips let it sit stir those chocolate chips in until they were melted and then put it in a ziplock bag with the corner cut off so that I could drizzle some of this chocolate ganache over top of the cheesecake you can further decorate this by adding more Reese's peanut butter cups cut them in half and then you just have to place them around the edge of the cheesecake you can use some of that extra chocolate ganache as glue to glue the peanut butter cups to the cheesecake if you need to and here it is completed in all its glory it looks spectacular when it's finished and I guarantee you it'll rival any cheesecake that you have purchased in a fancy restaurant or at a pastry shop now the brownie layer at the bottom does not overbake nor does it burn after baking this long in the oven it gets nice and dense and very fudgy the chocolate chips peanut butter chips and peanut butter cups in the center are delicious and the cheesecake topping is fantastic it is creamy and smooth and just delicious and not really overly sweet I love the ganache topping it just finishes it off perfectly this makes an enormous cheesecake that will serve at least 12 people and the slices will be nice and big and here are a few photos of the mini cheesecakes that I made with the leftover filling these were pretty good too I love cheesecake it is my favourite dessert and I've made quite a few them on my channel I put them all together on a cheesecake playlist so if you want to see it

yeah that's it i'm just gonna go i'll see you next time bye [Music] you", "5h7EOhD4Ieg": "hello my name is King silverback I hope you having a fantastic day today is an incredibly beautiful day and today I'm going to be trying something brand new and I got this for an absolutely shocking price so if you know anything about unreal chocolates this right here if you know anything about this you know that they're kind of expensive I went to uh what's it called I'm trying not to say the name just just for you know poops and giggles cuz you know I'm weird but anyway what's your gas station and I forgot what it is even called but yeah it's a gas station I went to a gas station and I don't go inside this one very often I usually just go to the pump and I'm good and everything I do go to the bigger gas stations that are like indoors cuz I'll usually go to the bathroom like while I'm working so I go in there but I haven't been in this one but apparently they have a table where they have stuff discounted like they got mad or not mayonnaise mustard I don't eat mayonnaise or mustard so I just yeah call them the same because they are but anyway so basically looking at it and I saw something familiar I saw the name unreal and I was like I know unwritten unreal they got that good good you think got that good chocolate that good tene water chocolate you feel me so what does the logical person do go over there and see how much it is so I'm looking at it I'm like oh this is this is yeah this is vegan and then I see the price so I got something I mean you see this price right here that's a dollar fifty for something that is usually let me look it up right quick gotta look it up here so these are usually around five six dollars so I'm seeing oh my goodness that's really loud I'm seeing $5 and $6 so we'll just say it's $6 so you know you're looking at around six dollars for this typically and I got it for a dollar fifty now what's nice about living in a state in an area that isn't vegan friendly you could say is that you get stuff like this for extremely cheek so sweet Lorenz is a very good cookie company there were a lot better I feel like they've kind of changed the formula and it's not as good but still pretty good and they have cookies in our area that they're selling for like like a I think about a dollar fifty actually like these cookies are usually like eight dollars for a full thing and I'm getting them for a dollar fifty at one point now they don't even sell them at the store cuz they didn't sell law there so you know they marked the prices down and stuff like that which is always unfortunate but also at the same time it's good for me because I get to get some so I that's why I'm able to try as much as I do a lot of the time because I'm getting it for cheaper I'm like this is a dollar fifty I would never pay full price for this cuz it's not really my favorite so these are the crispy dark chocolate peanut butter cups apparently the crispy part is quinoa and yeah so I'm gonna try it back in the day like the crunch bars and stuff like that that aren't vegan I never really ate those for the most part so this is gonna be interesting this is one of my favorite things about unreal as they're packaging the packaging is just cute like you know and it's this tiny little thing you don't have to deal with any of the paper or anything like that that's what it looks like so I'm going to try it in three two that's what it looks like inside just thought it's alright quick it's been a solid minute since I've had a Reese's but these are so close so close hmm it's one of those things it's like oh man I don't have any left and then you realize I got a whole entire Kate a container of them now this isn't something that I'd like by regularly just cuz like you know I'm not getting it for a dollar fifty pretty much anywhere besides there and this was the last one so that was wild so I might go in there everyone saw see if they got any other vegan stuff that's you know crazy the markdown so didn't check but I probably should check what the expiration date is Oh it's November first oh my so I'm good I'm good for quite a few months what's today at the 27th Wow feels like June's already been over I don't know why it feels like June's been over but I don't know Jim's been kind of a weird month haven't really worked much kind of just worked so my parents had like you know my mom had her birthday my dad had Father's Day so I just kind of worked for those holidays and I haven't really worked for me this much I feel like I was kind of rambling but anyway the video kind of cut off but basically they're really really good I actually had another one well I was clearing footage so I definitely recommend these I'm not gonna say that you know buying it full price or whatever it's a hundred percent worth it but if you want some good chocolate like this is a good quality chocolate so it's kind of funny how the packaging is always gonna make it look better quite obviously but when it comes to chocolates that are dark chocolate a lot of times will make them lighter to make you think that it's actually milk chocolate like even when I looked over at I was like wave that's milk chocolate I can't even get this but I looked at it and it was dark chocolate but when you actually open it up like it's it's dark and it's supposed to be a thing you can see the color disparity yeah they're saying it's gonna be light and look how dark it is like and that's completely fine I don't care excuse me oh man I have to eat this but yeah so anyway that's all for this video definitely recommend this you can pretty much give this anywhere I mean I find out you can get at the gas station which I didn't know was the thing so and I'm assuming the gas station that's gonna be quite expensive because you know gas station stuff is more expensive if you didn't know like anybody out there that didn't know gas station food and stuff like that unless it may be you know 7-elevens and stuff like that is 7/11 what is it called like in Florida I forget what it's called think it's 7-eleven places like that sometimes they may be cheaper but for the most part they're not they're more expensive than anywhere so that's just FYI not the meat and uh food like that yeah that a lot of times is going to be cheaper but obviously cheaper quality doesn't matter but anyway that's all for this video hope you enjoy my name is King so I hope you have a fantastic day and I'll see you later dude", "EZN5jXu170o": "hi guys welcome back to my channel my name is Laura Bruno and in today's video I'm gonna be showing you my recipe for peanut butter cups they're one of my favorites I am so excited to show you this it's so easy to make so let's get started so what you'll need is two cups of chocolate pieces a half a cup of peanut butter 3 tablespoons of softened butter 1 tablespoon of oil 1/2 a cup of confectioner's sugar a pinch of salt and candy liners the first thing you're going to do is to take your peanut butter and your butter and you're gonna put the butter into the peanut butter and make sure you have a microwavable bowl because this is going to be going into the microwave okay with your pinch of salt and it's going to go into the microwave until it's smooth I'll show you what it looks like so you're going to start off with maybe about a minute [Music] okay so it looks like this alright next we're going to be putting in the confectioner sugar so you just put that in you mix it around so once it's mixed and it's nice and creamy okay you're just gonna put this off to the side because we're gonna be working with the chocolate pieces so next we have to melt the chocolate pieces so what I'm doing is I'm making a double boiler and I put like an inch of water inside the pot and it came to a simmer okay and you're just going to place the chocolate pieces on top of the pot try not to have the water touching the bottom of the bowl okay with that you're going to add your oil and you just go to melt the pieces and continue to stir it around you can also melt the chocolate pieces in the microwave but I like to do it this way so once the chocolate is melted just stir it around okay you're gonna take it off and just put it to the side because right now it's a little too warm and just let it cool for about two minutes then you're going to take your cups and I have mine just sitting in a a pan and you're going to take a spoon and just put the chocolate on the bottom of the paper cups now I'm using a tablespoon but you can use a teaspoon to do this so once you have the chocolate on the bottom of the cups next we're going to be taking the peanut butter mix it around take another spoon and just put it inside the middle of the chocolate so after I put the peanut butter inside the middle of the chocolate I'm going to be putting this into the refrigerator and I'm gonna let it cool for about ten minutes and then I'll be putting the chocolate on top of the peanut butter next I'm going to be putting the chocolate on top of the peanut butter so you just take it and just cover it so once all the cups are filled with the chocolate you just going to tap it just fit even it out okay and now I'm going to be placing it back into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes hey guys so after I let these chill in the refrigerator I just took them out and I'm going to cut one open so I'm just killing back the paper and this is what it looks like okay and I'll show you what the inside looks like so you have the peanut butter and the Chocolate and I'm definitely going to try this oh man it is so good you really have to make this it's so easy and what a combination of the peanut butter and the Chocolate definitely I'm going to have to put this away so here you have it my recipe for peanut butter cups they're so delicious okay guys like comment share and subscribe bye guys", "gLCLuU1wCh0": "it's a baby one does a big one just like that is disgusting they're all over in that thing oh oh I'm never eating another reason again so much for my favorite candy dude now I'm

wrong I'm never working that like not wanting to eat a Reese's ever and this is completely like but just like ruined it all mm-hmm somebody's one I got to candy yeah you", "kPdwPrKTT2w": "hey guys I'm not just a nobody anymore I'm a small-time youtuber and that means I'm gonna go the route of all small-time youtubers of a cash grab copying the big ones that's right I'm making a giant candy now I'm not just making any giant candy no I'm not making us crappy Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I'm making the mack daddy of them all the Trader Joe's dark peanut butter cup so I like peanut butter cups and I liked Reese's growing up and I have kind of the typical problems that people have with them as they get older and get better taste not enough chocolate too sweet too gritty it's not my thing my husband actually thought he didn't even like peanut butter cups until he tried the Trader Joe's version because of the grittiness and the weirdness wasn't appealing didn't even like it as a child so I'm super excited but I have a plan we are going to use good ingredients from Trader Joe's hashtag not sponsored just hashtag sad to close Shane Dawson just making a giant candy because I'm a fat pig that's right so we have a pound plus of 72% Trader Joe's cat-cows chocolate we have organic Trader Joe's peanut butter so there's a there's a little cross-section pretty good amount of chocolate not much on the sides they're not particularly uniform it kind of just looks like they're popped in there hmm so it's not really sweet and gritty in the same way imagine some new persons 400 M is just watching my fat ass eat peanut butter cups welcome to my channel so there's no peanut butter in the chocolate unlike Reese's so we can just melt our chocolate down coat it we're gonna put it on this pie plate because I'm lazy and yeah that will give it a little bit of ribbing with peanut butter a little sweet I'm sure this is good fees so I think what I'm gonna try to do originally I was thinking I would butter the pie plate and try to put the chocolate in but I don't know how we're gonna get it out in one homogeneous piece so you think what I might actually do is line it with foil cut it with melted chocolate go ahead and freeze it it's a peanut butter cup I don't have to temper it Claire and I are on the same page there I feel you Claire you're my ride-or-die you just don't know it yet [Music] so I am making a decision possibly really babbling I'm not gonna whip the peanut butter I'm gonna put it straight in there I think it's sweet enough already we're just gonna dump it in wish me luck ooh oh my god I have frozen this for over an hour we are gonna put the top layer on this is exciting yes hopefully it does not like just melt in I'm cautiously optimistic oh crap I don't know if there's gonna be enough chocolate all right I'm just gonna try gently code it on it's a giant peanut butter cup we're done she's done she goes in the freezer she's beautiful it's my second-born I love her yes we did it here she is I got a little aggro at the end anyway guys I am so excited it turned out there's peanut butter inside this it came out of the pie plate there's a little tin foil stuck to the edge and then when I get the chance with sassy daddy we are gonna cut into this and give it a try I am so excited ahh Oh sassy daddy guess what I made you a surprise I'm sure you that you were completely oblivious to the purchasing of the ingredients and the screaming and swearing and me being in the kitchen for hours and your stated plan of making this yes I made you a giant Trader Joe's dark peanut butter cup there you go there's a thumbnail would you like to hold it mmm how do i bite it yeah let me cut it for you like a pie here you can eat this wait wait this is America it's a little runny you know just a little bit mmm and that look good it didn't consummate like oh I'll freeze it more how is it I liked it so we're gonna go dump this on our nice neighbors who have done nothing but be nice to us or we're gonna go contribute to their heart disease they're still teaching that'll teach them but overall I turned out pretty good you know I think if I read it I would probably paint with some coconut oil or some olive oil in there and maybe like you know a reduced simple syrup or something sweet enough that II nut butter a little blue one being like a nice hot bowl of milk that cat loves and by being a dog's favorite treat I would give this three into corners seriously what would you rate it yes like these are like a for the actual like peanut butter cups mmm yeah I feel like that's pretty good yeah it's actually not sweet enough but he's not something I hear you say true as always thank you for watching be sure to like this video or if you're horribly

much to be thankful for always i'm thankful for this recipe it's a no-bake recipe you don't even have to heat your kitchen for this the first thing we're gonna do is melt one stick of butter so i've melted my butter and i'm just gonna add one cup of graham cracker crumbs another little kitty cup shanny gave me i love these measuring cups then we're gonna add one cup of peanut butter i wonder if they will ever come up with peanut butter sticks you know like they have crisco sticks that'd be so easy i'm not complaining i love peanut butter i'm just saying two cups powdered sugar i always want to add more of this stuff because i love everything powdered sugar peanut butter butter graham cracker crumbs but you should stick to the recipe and i'm telling myself that for the consistency sake i spilled some powdered sugar i'm so glad it's a party now now i'm just going to mix this up this didn't even take very long to mix for some reason the mixture didn't stick on those whisks very well so whoever gets to eat those whisks they kind of get shorted i'm just going to put mine in my little square pan you can put yours in a heart shape or a circle for fun i am going to put parchment paper down on the bottom of my pan one of the things that's fun about this dough is you can play with it like play-doh it's got nothing bad in it you could divide it up and give it to the kids around your table to play with and make a sculpture that sounds so fun since i don't have any kids around my table today i'm gonna put mine in a pan i've pressed all the batter into the pan now all i need to do is melt my two cups of chocolate chips after making this recipe the first time i made it i wondered if there are graham cracker crumbs in reese's cups don't you wonder it's the exact same consistency i can't wait for y'all to taste this and see for yourselves don't you all love chocolate chips i mean you can melt them pour them over things you can eat them by themselves they're just great i'm thankful for chocolate chips okay i'm gonna go melt these while the chocolate chips are melting let's dance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i love melting chocolate chips in the microwave because they melt so evenly and perfectly and now we're going to spread them over our peanut butter mixture y'all can guess how amazing my kitchen smells i'm thankful for that too the melted chocolate chips in this bowl looks so creamy and wonderful now but i mean as soon as it hits cold water those chocolate chips turn to cement no i should clean this bowl out when the chocolate's still hot after i eat every bit of chocolate chip residue i can these are so fun you can put these in little shapes and they come out so easily with the parchment paper you can wrap them up for gifts they're so good and they're so rich and i think they taste better than reese's that you buy i said it i'm not taking it back that's my story and i'm sticking to it so thankful for this spatula with all that chocolate on there and i haven't taken any from my from my bars did you see like the 12 baskets left over of food in the feeding of the 5 000 so wonderfully extra i'm going to put this in the refrigerator and chill it for a little bit so it hardens up and the top just gets really smooth and beautiful like a store-bought reese's speaking of thankfulness i am thankful you joined me today and i'm thankful for peanut butter cup bars don't forget to thank jesus and enjoy see you next time [Music] you", "OviyMSGlpE8": "hey guys welcome back to my panel in today's video I will be making these vegan Reese's peanut butter cups these are so simple to make but tastes delicious they are such a nice treat to make for parties or share with your friends or you can just eat them all yourself just like me so let's get started ingredients you will need are a nut butter of choice try to get one that is all natural and kind of on the runny or side I chose this creamy almond butter from trader joes but you can also use a classic peanut butter or cashew butter you can also offer a chunky if you prefer that texture next you'll need some coconut flour and maple syrup and then chocolate of course I added some sea salt on top but that is completely optional start by mixing one cup of your nut butter with 3 tablespoons of coconut flour and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup [Music] mix that until you have a texture sort of like this it should be able to fold shape when you roll it but not stick your hands you may need to adjust the amount of coconut flour you [Music] next roll your almond butter mixture into shapes I just chose these flattened rounds but you can definitely get creative with it you can make some hearts or you could probably use a cookie cutter and punch them out you can also try to put them into little mold and make them more of the Reese's Peanut Butter shape if that's what you're going for mouse the non-dairy chocolate of choice I chose a dark chocolate 50 rounds into chocolate with a fork and make sure it gets completely covered then let the chocolate drip off place on a parchment paper-lined plate or tray so you can easily transport them once all of the almond butter shapes are covered in chocolate you can sprinkle them with some sea salt or vegan sprinkles or you can just leave them completely plain let them sit in the fridge for 10 minutes so the chocolate can set then enjoy I hope you like this video if you did make sure to give it a thumbs up if you are new to my channel make sure to subscribe for more videos like this if you want to see

[Music]", "OPlG4Kt-Jsg": "what's up everyone it's time for another Wayne and Tara nice [Music] hey guys food review all right what are you reviewing today boss alright well as you can see I have a special guest today Jeremy's but Weston still here up up up say what's up now dogs can't eat chocolate so Weston will not be reviewing this because I don't want him getting sick so I have my buddy to replace Hudson today I'll be the dog today so what are we reviewing today we got the new Reese's thin butter cups ah what it says on the back Risa spins me time just got better let's start with the price point I believe this 7.37 ounce package was 399 now buddy as a discount person how do you feel about the price of this 399 ah find a cheaper will to Great Valley alternatives but we got that all right I I agree I think it's a decent price it could be cheaper maybe we would get a sale someday but 399 I think is alright right like that let's see how many we actually have in here let's count that out real quick so you guys can see that what's tilt down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 I think if I counted right now let's go back to that price point I'm looking at these and they are actually pretty damn tiny so I'm gonna go yeah that's a little pricey for these look look at that one thing I want to add what they could have done instead of wrapping these individually they could have just put a bunch of them in the bag and that would drive down cost so you can maybe milk out three more of these that is true but I don't think do they usually do that I have no idea yeah I don't know so I don't think I've seen that done in a while maybe years ago yeah whatever alright let's get into buddy since you're the guests I will let you go first all right my easy spoon hey your folks yeah pretty fun pretty hand so uh that's what she said yeah first and foremost uh Mary listen maybe I'll listen um I guess it's just like around regular Reese's except better I got to go now is it Reese's or recess Risa um Lee Martin and you're in the comments section tell us what you think is the right pronunciation of it I always thought it was Reese's Pieces he goes Reese's must be a reasonable thing who knows yeah I don't know either so yeah I'm probably just wrong I'm mine's already melty so I got some chocolate on my finger it looks like I touched poop but yeah all right all right first thoughts of it is definitely thin um I feel it's more chewy than the original version yeah we've got that little Reese's a small for us more food I gotta say I think I prefer thick I agree with three C's maybe even four these are good though it's not bad but yeah look pop the whole thing in your mouth I don't know did we do this or not cuz I was going to say why hey so yeah cross-section yeah you guys can see them it's definitely more peanut buttery I think because it is then mm-hmm but it kind of gives me like a caramel texture good point good point yeah it is good but call me crazy but if they were to have like a peanut butter edition of the Milky Way bar if I taste something like this if I had to guess I think I would very much agree with you on that alright you want there something fun sure do you want to have a three Reese's Reese's Peanut Butter Cup yeah sure why not all right this is gonna be wrapped in all your first time ever on a food oh snap but we go down here folks how do we do that the time or Fred or once provides you got the on screen timer no wait no I doesn't that a do though yeah we don't need it you guys can count you guys can kind of smart people well I mean like when shall we start how do we do that oh you know what can Google they do that okay Google Hey okay Google oh it's on battery saver mode wah-wah-wah okay Google ten-second countdown sure ten seconds starting now it's not good like going down what are you doing I'll do I have to hit it possibly so that's I wanted to like talk can it talk oh we got it and do it I guess I want to talk and give me a kappa okay Google give me a countdown sure for how long 10 seconds same crap now it's at 27 seconds the lead okay three oh you got stuck on the wrapper yes I did sorry bud haha Wesson I think he knows he can't really happy today let's see there's still enough for a rematch haha do you want a rematch oh sure why not all right okay Google give me up five-second countdown oh it's going down to one [Applause] yeah you redeemed yourself I did I sure did but we'll call it a tie everybody win there's two left if there's two left I wonder how many wait maybe I counted wrong in the beginning well I guess we might as well finish the last two cheers buddy I'm serious yeah see we just spent I spent four dollars on this got way too fast so my recommendations I wouldn't get it unless it was cheaper than four dollars and I would still get the thicker ones I agree and I would wait and tell those oneself they was yeah or you know maybe if it's on sale Halloween Reese's and then get it when Halloween's over or you know one of those discount days or Easter or Valentine's Day get it discount style there you go all right cheers Boyer's and since I'm the dog of

"PFHYIaJdqeo": "can I start over today I'm going to show you how to make easy chocolate peanut butter cups first of all you put one Cuba melted butter in your mixer then you add one fourth of a cup of light hiral syrup then you add one cup of peanut butter and you mix those three ingredients together first of all soon as you get that mixed together you're going to start adding one to two cups of powdered sugar just enough to make it a stiff dough now it's all mixed and it's nice and stiff so what you want to do is a little scooper and just mix out little balls not too big just about the size these are going to be the inside of your peanut cups okay now that I've made all the little balls peanut butter balls ready to start I put out all the little mini paper cups mini size paper cups on on a cookie sheet and next you're going to get some dipping chocolate and you're going to melt it in the microwave ok so i melted a hole bar of dipping chocolate for about a minute 30 seconds kind of looks nice and smooth and easy to work with ok so the first thing you're going to want to do is since you have everything all lined up you're going to put just a dab of the chocolate you have to work fast because this chocolate does set up you're just going to put the data chocolate in the bottom of each of your cups that's why you have a cookie sheet is it's messy then you take a little ball stick it right in the center of that maybe take your chocolate and you put it on the top smooth it all over and make it look nice and cute make sure you cover the whole ball of peanut butter then he let that set up with the white chocolate you fast easy chocolate peanut butter cups and you made them yourself", "vQosWBSn4W8": "and welcome to another edition of carbs young representing the only

is straight but peanut butter balls right here on our new dining on a dime that's color cover with color pictures hardcover with color pictures I can pre-order my own dining on a dime Dave get yours today with Free Shipping until Wednesday how was that Wow good thanks Christy wants to know why I'm in the doghouse with buster cuz he's razzing me about my desktop show them my desktop now no it is this was a working woman's [Laughter] you got a problem with my desktop she's not she's not normally checking she's not normally like admiring herself underneath but it's actually not a purpose it's a personal motivation thing I think she hasn't explained it has a purpose do I have to explain to explain it maybe I have reasons I wasn't asking for you to explain peanut butter cups Reese's peanut butter cups homemade peanut butter cups recipe is on page three sixty four in our new hardcover color edition so if Kathy has an important question are the recipes in the hardcover book the same as the other books yes yes now we are working on a sequel which we hope will be out in the spring yes it will yeah I wiII keep trudging along but we keep having like major issues come up with computer problems equipment all of that okay Jennifer says she feels underdressed you should Jennifer I need you you need to go get your Christmas hat we have a whole stock over here if you don't have one you can come get it okay to start this recipe you're gonna take your chocolate chips now these here are the Hershey's Kisses that I got for 75 cents a bag right there okay and either your paraffin or I used coconut oil because I didn't happen to have any paraffin now don't freak out about paraffin guys yes Dave don't freak out about paraffin paraffin is used wax is used in all kinds of coatings for candies and that kind of thing it's what makes the candy tarp nothing happens it just goes in one end and out the other what's works nicely coating everything as it goes not really it just goes in and out guys so there's nothing harmful with it so don't freak out about using paraffin but it's just wax me it's just wax like the great wax yes you don't want to use that you can use coconut oil okay which I happen to use just because I had now I'm stirring this and I'm getting it going you guys look at my cute little nails for this for this season all right cute okay so we're stirring this up yes I know my measuring cup was already had chocolate in it I wasn't gonna wash it from when I made my sample peanut butter cup can you check the weather and see how cold it is out for me okay so we're getting this stirred it is 40 degrees currently okay I've load tonight of 25 when's our next no are we gonna get defrost Oh Thursday 30% on Thursday okay so we are using the Hershey's Kisses here but just use a bag of chocolate chips if you want it's fine now I can heat this up more and I probably will actually I'm gonna eat it up just a bit more yeah so you kind of split between yes tire my desk looks top looks just like that in you're trying to be crazy yes sacred wonders mean I went any time I need to get on her computer for something I think why it's right there so I can find it when I'm working on it I know I just can't see since they're overlapping each other I said she needs a desktop extension for the planner there okay there we go I hope everybody had a wonderful Thanksgiving if your turkey was absolutely the best turkey you've ever eaten because you used our recipe would you tell everybody please we had one lady who emailed us and said I was so embarrassed the turkey was raw she put it eight o'clock in the morning I want to eat it up one and I was like if you don't follow the recipe is not gonna turn out but if you follow the recipe it will be the absolute best turkey you have ever eaten in your entire life so I want everybody to be proof that that is true okay but there's always hope it's a good learning experience yeah all right follow the recipe guys do as I say not as I do okay now I've just taken a pie plate tada and I developed a little bit of chocolate and I lie oh I lined my pie plate with plastic wrap you can do foil or plastic wrap whichever you want doesn't really matter and I'm just putting a nice little layer all around don't go to too high you want to go about just a little over 3/4 up to the edge but not quite all the way to the edge okay little past 3/4 but not all the way to the edge if that makes sense okay all right so then you're gonna do just like that okay now Dave my magic of television dude is gonna go put this just leave the camera down in the freezer for me Stacey wants to know instead of chocolate chips can we use her instead of chocolate chips can we use almond bark yes you can use almond bark and you can use dairy-free chips and dairy-free butter in this if you want now our 25 Christmas candies article which this is in is our number one article of all time on our website and I am getting ready hopefully tomorrow maybe to get a gluten free dairy free one of that up for you guys ok so for those of you who have issues like me you can enjoy Christmas candies once again I didn't see who asked it but somebody asks hope asks how long did you melt that for the microwave 30-second increments until it's melted stirring okay you have to stir it a lot or else in between or else it all will turn weird yeah you have to make sure you stir it every 30 seconds okay so in here now I have my powdered sugar and my creamy peanut butter and a stick of butter or a half a cup of non-dairy if you want okay so we got that in there and then I because I think the world needs more salt people this is not in the recipe but I had just a Titch of salt because I think it brings out the flavour better just a touch touch touch one dish just one little touch and then your vanilla and this homemade vanilla is in our cookbook our dining iodine cookbook and on our website I forgot to have my cat the link but just type in vanilla or type in homemade vanilla on our website you'll find it okay so now Dave get ready to turn down the mic we're gonna mix this until it's well blended okay ready alright ok so here's a Tara problem I did not get my butter soft enough so I'm gonna throw this in the microwave and nuke it for like 20 seconds just to get my butter slightly softened ok just not longer than that just a Titch why that's because it's Christmas we're festive okay does it give me a thumbs up if you think we look festive do you think we also live in your apron thank you mom made me mine own for the holidays apron it's a joke Cooper original huh Wow we should tell you know who did Christmas music [Music] all right there you go now if you're doing regular peanut butter cups or peanut butter balls sorry see that sorry okay if you're making regular peanut butter cups or peanut butter balls you will do your your peanut butter cups the way I just did my big my big pie plate mold except you'll do the little tiny 1-inch muffin cups and you'll just line each muffin cup with a little bit of chocolate then you're gonna take a little bit like this and you're gonna put one in each muffin cup when your chocolate is set if you're doing peanut butter balls then you can just stick it in your chocolate get it a little there and then let it drink okay I didn't say so there so now if Dave my trusty assistant went run out and get my mold for me now I will say that I made one and a half batches because my pie that pie plate is nine inches and its larger if you have an 8 inch pie plate one batch is fine so don't freak out if you don't have enough you can just make another half batch put it in there it's not gonna hurt anything okay so Debbie is asking is that vanilla better and cheaper than store-bought it's not necessarily cheaper but it is real vanilla versus the score bot okay so then your chocolate is hardened like that okay then you're gonna put in your peanut butter cup now I'll tell you a little bit more about my vanilla in just a minute okay so then you're gonna put in your peanutbutter Cup I probably could have had just a tad more peanut butter but that's okay now this is a great gift for teenage boys because they love food and what you could do is give them this with like a $10 bill on the top or something like that my nephew loves peanut butter cups so that's what I do also our york peppermint pattie sour peppermint patties in the book what do we call them party mints I think we call them party mints in the book they're actually the same as peppermint patties and we let me knit this just a second more we can do the same thing with the peppermint patties and make a great big peppermint patty which is pretty cool too yeah okay there you go now got it just softened up just a bit here so then you're gonna pour your chocolate on top okay there we go and then you're just gonna smooth your chocolate all the way around okay there we go just like so and then you're gonna throw this back in the freezer and let it harden up okay then Dave can you hand me the one out of the freezer there it's on the top shelf I think maybe second shelf Christina this recipe is actually in the are already existing book yes yes 65 364 for the new hardcover color edition okay ma'am put this in the freezer and let it set up and then to the magic at the same page number for the regular 20th anniversary edition as well magic of television this one has set up for a while okay then you can either leave in it I just leave it in the plastic wrap and then what I do is just make sure that my plastic wrap is long enough to go over the front and then I wrap it in cellophane but you can take it off the plastic wrap if you want see I just go like this this one I didn't make long enough but that's okay like this this would work with dark chocolate just fine right oh yeah dark chocolate chocolate peanut butter chips whatever you want so you can just wrap it like that but let me show you what it looks like when it's done [Music] okay Mindy says the party mints are amazing made the last year for work party made lemon ones and coconut - yeah [Music] we love making the Christmas candies the main trouble is nothing yeah we have issues okay there you go so here is your great big peppermint or your great big chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cup now if you have little spaces like here and here this isn't that bad but if you have a hole or whatever just melt a little bit of chocolate and just dab it on there and you can fill it okay so now to serve just take a great big knife and we're going down oops oh dear everybody's loving everybody so it looks yummy no there's one serving of peanut butter cup doesn't I look good guys okay so I will say if there's anything that will help that will break my gluten free dairy free diet it's this for sure oh my goodness I absolutely love peanut butter cups they're probably I just like Christmas candies in general it's so mu t says the peppermint patties are my favorite pretty much the same as Australia enough for dinner mints so yummy actually we love them and I had never had them before so I'm very tired and then Jill would make them like every Christmas and this is so awesome but it's hard not to eat too many but we would store him in the freezer so yeah take a little bit to eat one up she got it out look so it kind of helps me not eat too many we have out of so we're between things right yes but just saying so for those of you who are wondering this isn't our hardcopy hardcover dining iodine cookbook color pictures which are just splatted page 364 this right here is the one with the correct pictures right there so you can see it if you have that if you have this 20th anniversary edition it's the same book it's just that that one is a hardcover so just so you know that page numbers are the same the recipes are the same so if you were wondering about that that's the case yeah just before I go I forgot who asked how was our Thanksgiving dinner whoops recast it was actually uneventful which was unusual for us see so it was really good uneventful in a good way she means which is awesome usually I splat the turkey on the floor or something but we had a kind of a nice spread of food but not so much that we were totally overwhelmed and I think a little bit cleaned up in like 20 minutes - it was great and then the kids that aren't that don't live here anymore came back which was awesome and we hung out and talked in played some games and went sledding we had so much snow but was so awesome to go out there with them sledding particularly the older ones yeah so yeah so it was good it was a nice relaxing day yeah do you want to look at the other stream mostly I was just oh actually Genevieve asked can you use peanut butter made with only peanuts or do you need the type of oil you don't need the type with paint with oil added but I would probably add a little bit more butter my better I didn't soften my butter enough I just had sitting on the counter and so it's a little bit chilly but I would add just a little bit more butter to make it soft and back to the vanilla that was nine dollars it was nine dollars for this to make real vanilla so and you can reuse the vanilla beans for one or two bottles of this so that is actually probably cheaper than what you get in the store a lot of people sing they would break a diet for that yeah yeah Genevieve said how many servings is this me I would be one I love peanut butter cups legit it's probably 50 servings oh thank you Susie and she said she's praying for my brother every day thank you he needs it he's still not doing very good and he went to the doctor the other day and was so discouraged by the time he left he was just like why do I even go to the doctor anymore so anyway Kristina said I've always hated cooked spinach but I just made your recipe it's chicken and pasta and I and it was so so good I ate cooked spinach

address just scroll down just a little bit and my oh yeah Jamie's right Mike likes dark chocolate he loves dark chocolate so I said chocolate but he loves dark chocolate okay you guys don't forget your wonderful mother who gave you life what mother I don't know of a mother I just see chocolate for me yes Amelia I painted my kitchen cabinets and redid my kitchen about a month and a half ago Danny I made your favorite two or a major two ingredient fudge and it turned out I hit again yay do you prefer to add nuts within the mixture or on top when it comes to the recipes like fudge peanut butter cups it doesn't matter either way you want to do it it's perfectly fine I have done it both ways so yeah I have done it both ways so it doesn't really matter let's see Oh Amy T says you have to ration the chocolate because it's impossible to get in Australia see really Wow I can see why it's super tasty um okay do-do do-do where we at yes so you can send cards for Mike's birthday which is the 12th living on a dying Pino Box 193 Mead Colorado 805 42 he would absolutely love that haven't been able to say anything because he's always on and always seeing stuff so I can't say it to surprise him so this way since he had to go get Jack I can surprise him oh so you you purposely said the roads are probably too dangerous for dese event dad would go no but they are too dangerous for Dave our roads are super slick I about died Saturday all it was horrible I did not normally don't go out when it's that bad but I didn't know because we are in town as soon as I got out of town the snow was blowing from the farm fields over the roads and it had covered the roads I couldn't see the road the snow was like six to eight inches deep we don't have a four-wheel drive it's just a regular camp between a Camry thankfully a big dump truck pulled out in front of me and I was able to follow him but I couldn't turn around or anything I couldn't even see to turn around and so then I finally got into town and I was like well I might as well do what I'm doing now needed to do while I'm in town but I called Mike before I left and I said okay if I'm not home in 45 minutes this is the road I'm taking you need to come look for me because I had forgotten my phone so yeah so it was very hair-raising um Kathy you can get it together and get decluttered that's why I have in here for the daily for the daily one door or one shelf just clean a declutter one drawer or one shelf that's how I do it being chronically ill you know I I'm kind of hard on myself because I don't feel like I'm the best housekeeper but after I've seen some youtubers I'm like wow I'm doing a whole lot better than I thought I was and it's because I do one drawer or one shelf a day or one deep-cleaning a day that type of thing so um yeah Gwen check out the bulk spice store for vanilla beans and that's where we get a lot of our spices as a bulk store but Walmart actually they're Walmart brand spices are actually cheaper than a spice store so I just get my spices at Walmart so um yes let's see what do we got going on here sorry guys it's hard for me to do this OOP did it do so I don't know when mom's coming out she was gonna head out tomorrow but now today we got good news that grandpa has maybe doing a little bit better this boy I we don't know what to think mom has her bags packed she's ready to come out if she needs to but now since grandpa's doing a little bit better she may not come out until her original plan which is around the 19th or 20th so we'll see Mike is gonna be 50 that's why I say and if you guys want to send him a card he was he would love it and I wanted to do something for him so I'm gonna have a surprise birthday party for him on the show on the 11th cuz we don't have a show day on Thursday but on the 11th so I thought that would be kind of fun to do and yes dark chocolate is his favorite and it's healthy see he's so healthy dark chocolate is amazing I don't get why people say they dislike it I know like it's really good yeah dark chocolate is amazing Dave's right Dave loves dark chocolate too Denise do we have a C's candy by you I think we do I think there's one up in the mall here um mm-hmm no Judy Mike won't watch the video later because this one we don't have to do anything with so he won't go back and watch it that's why I'm that's why I'm saying it now okay let's see do not give up Cathy you can get it clean so here's what I do I get one drawer or cabinet cleaned out or shelf one drawer shelf whatever you can manage then maintain that the secret is maintaining it once you get it decluttered it's super easy to maintain it so like looks clean out your pot holders then every time you put your pot holder back just straighten it up get rid of things you're not using put things where they belong then you can keep it straightened up all the time now I will tell you it was a super hard being chronically ill with little kids to stay on top of it but I still tried to at least do one drawer cabinet a couple of times a week if not all the time but like every time I go put underwear or socks in the closet I straighten up that drawer so that it's not always being piled on top of with more stuff that you don't need so if I see something in there and that's another thing guys if you see something right away okay mom we'll have to do a podcast on this break that on your list if you see something just do it right away so like for Jack if I'm going through his closet looking for something or whatever let's say I'm picking out clothes to wear to a concert or something and I see a shirt that's too small I automatically just take it off and throw it in the goodwill pile I don't wait to go through his closet I just take it out then and I have a continual goodwill pile always going and it seems like it's always full and then once a month I take a load to the goodwill but with four kids growing and getting out of clothes and stuff like that you know we have a lot so anyway um and we call it mom and I call it the five minute commercial cleaning if you don't have any energy watched even if you watch TV all day you can get up during one commercial and load the dishwasher you can get up the next commercial put the laundry in the washer next commercial you can go and clean out one section of your plates or your mugs or something then go sit back down and just do it for three to five minutes and then sit back down that's how you do these things when you're chronically ill everybody says how do you do so much when you're sick I do a little bit and then I rest and then I do a little bit and then I rest but I never stopped doing a little bit and the little bits always add up big and that's actually one of my tips and the new planner which by the way guys I don't know if I said this but the set is 25% off with free shipping only until Wednesday but that's why the tips in here is to keep doing the little things because they add up big um Joanne I have a pile of cards over here for Mike I think I probably I think I did get yours so um I just didn't want to show them on the show because he would might suspect something uh okay let's see oh thanks Maria for sending Mike a birthday card um okay let's see I think I got through Facebook here just a second Oh doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo how many aprons do you have I don't know I think I have close to 50 oh thanks for the super chat ir that's so nice thank you we appreciate it okay let me look through the YouTube comments here um dad uh it's beginning to look okay how about oh holy night okay the great battery test of 2019 so I told you I was doing that today but I went and figured the cost on all the batteries last night and I was completely shocked and I mean completely shocked to the point that I decided to rerun the test just to make sure my numbers were correct because it was such a dramatic difference I couldn't believe that it was that big of a difference so I'm the great battery test of 2019 this week again to make sure my numbers are correct and the next week probably Monday probably Monday show I am going to do that so yeah I got my hand at Walmart on clearance last year for I think $2 so Oh goodbye Amy have a good day at work um knows charlie he won't watch the show now afterwards he's got way too much work to do where's a good place

the reasons why Elly likes this is her hands she used to be those people one of those people where her hands would be bloody at every winter I mean they would just be horrible and I felt so bad for her and this is what stopped it for her so that's why she really liked it hello brother uncle Dave's on Susan can you tell me about how you're investing your money now that you are debt-free so we haven't invested anything because our business has taken a note starting with this whole printer issue that we've had our business has not been doing very well so we're hoping in 2020 to get that back up now that we have the new printer and once we do that we will probably invest in something like real estate it's kind of where we're thinking we're gonna go not positive yet but we do want to save enough cash for another house so that we can get some property and put the business in a building of its own at least have the books in the shipping in a building of its own because we have ten pallets of books on their way this is gonna take up our garage and these last five or six snowstorms we've had since October we really liked parking in the garage and it's been kind of nice so we're kind of thinking hey we'd like to get a house where we can put the business out there so um Margaret question I lost my beloved dog the day before Thanksgiving I'm not sure if I should get another dog my heart says yes but I know how many thousands I've spent on a few altars away from retirement your thoughts honestly Margaret I wouldn't until you're just absolutely financially stable and I know it's really soon and I'm really sorry I know how painful that is Buster's getting really old and so were driving the day that he goes um but I will say I would give yourself a couple of months minimum just to let the grieving process happen and to get over that before you go right out and get another dog give yourself some time to kind of get over that because I know it's really hard and it's really still fresh so I would wait just a little bit um okay let's see let's see see see Uncle Dave says hi everybody yeah I mean yeah you're an emotional roller coaster right now because it just happened and so you need to give yourself some time to get over that I mean you don't really get over it but you know some time to deal with that before getting another one so um what does Ellie do to help her hands she uses the goat milk cream and it moisturizes her hands if you don't have like psoriasis or eczema or anything you can use the scented if you have psoriasis or add some use the unscented my brother and my son both use the unscented soap and I think BJ's using the goat milk cream unscented and that has really helped with their eczema yeah Ellie showed you her hands she did

These things are dangerous. Not only for your health, but for your limbs. I'm going to duplicate a Reese's Peanut Butter\nCup. \"What do you mean duplicate\" Let's go to the drawing board... Are you ready? Excuse me, you in the back. Are you ready? Pipe down. Pipe the fuck down. Alright, so peanut butter cup. Components: wrapper, peanut butter and chocolate. this is what goes into a peanut butter cup. However these are not vegan How do we make it vegan? I thought you'd never ask HOW. DOES. IT. WORK We're going to need:\nCocoa Butter Cacao Powder\nVanilla Salt\n& Maple Syrup Mix it all up... you get chocolate So we have to take this out of the hot water\nand let this sit on the counter and see if it hardens up a little bit I'm going to put it in the fridge, because\nI think the reason it's not thickening up is because this bowl is just way too hot. So this peanut butter is not really runny. It's kinda hard, kinda like chocolate but\ncrumbly. So I propose that we use real organic natural\nonly peanuts peanut butter and then to thicken it up a little bit we mix it with nutritional\nyeast. That will give it that granular like consistency\nand thicken it up a little bit so that it sits right in the middle. Alright tastes exactly like the peanut butter\nin a Reese Peanut Butter Cup. Now I'm going to put it in the fridge, just\nto harden it up a little bit, so it's easier to mould and stick in the middle of our chocolate. So it does harden up, so that's good. The fact that it's ready right now doesn't\nreally matter. So let's get this into our moulds. And help keep their shape, let's get them\ninto one of these guys. Spoon some chocolate into here. So let's just plop the peanut butter into\nthere. So it looks like we're going to have to cover\nit with more chocolate. Now let's put this guy in the freezer and\nsee what happens. Let's see if it worked. Oh come on! So it's leaking out the bottom. So besides the leakage happening in the bottom. The sides are ribbed like a regular Reese's\nPeanut Butter Cup. ....and the top is really flat. It looks exactly like a regular peanut butter\ncup. It's just leaking Back to the Drawing Board! I have another idea. First we had the chocolate and we floated\nthe peanut butter in the middle and it sunk to the bottom. But when I took it out, the chocolate was\nhard. So this is what I propose... This is a cupcake liner.... We put chocolate in the bottom, we put it\nin the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Until it's hard! Then we put peanut butter in the middle. So I put the peanut butter in the freezer\nas well so you can kind of like mould it like this, it's kind of like a Play-doh. Put it back in the freezer for 15 minutes,\nuntil that's hard. Then we coat the rest, with more chocolate. And then we'll put it in the freezer for about\nan hour and it will harden. And then hopefully the peanut butter will\nbe enrobed in delicious vegan cruelty free chocolate. Let's go try it. Do you want to find out if they worked. If there's no peanut butter in the bottom\noozing out. It's a success. Look! On a scale of 1 to 10. It's a TEN! So I've proved to you that you... yes, you. You can make your favorite childhood snack\nvegan. I want to know what you want me to make vegan\nnext. Leave me a comment below of the big thing\nthat you don't think can be made vegan. and I'll try my hardest to make it vegan. Stay classy Internet.", "Isp1WwBMiAI": "hey guys I'm Nick and on this episode of the scram line I am showing you a raw vegan full ingredient peanut butter cup recipe these things are delicious now the first time I had peanut butter cups was when I was in America earlier this year and I'm not a massive fan actually the Reese's peanut butter cups no don't like them they're just they taste like you're eating sandy peanut butter and it's gross I don't want that I mean lots of people probably do like them but they're not for me but I did go to a place in New York a patisserie that sold these peanut butter cups but they were like normal Reese's peanut butter cups they're like really good-quality dark chocolate and the peanut butter inside was real peanut butter it was delicious and I fell in love with them so those are my kind of peanut butter cups I decided to show a healthier version of peanut butter cups because to be honest I know about you guys but when I have peanut butter cups the combination of chocolate and peanut butter first of all is heaven on earth and I can't just stop at one so I need a healthier version of these things so that I can have about 300 of them so if that's you then these are perfect for you because they're healthy and they're delicious so these are the ingredients you're going to need to make them okay guys for these you're going to need four ingredients some melted coconut oil maple syrup raw peanut butter and some cocoa powder so we're going to get started with making our chocolate so basically combine your melted coconut oil and your maple syrup into your cocoa powder and give it a mix next you're going to place some of that into your cupcake liners and make sure that it coats the sides and bottom evenly place those in the fridge or freezer for about ten minutes let them Harden and we're going to place some of that raw peanut butter in the center drizzle a little bit more of that chocolate on top now if your chocolate hardens and it probably will if it's cold you can just pop it in the microwave for a couple seconds and give it a mix so place those in the fridge or freezer for another 20 to 30 minutes let them harden completely now you can store these in the fridge for up to two weeks but I can guarantee you they won't last that long ok guys so those are my raw vegan peanut butter cups I hope you enjoyed this recipe if you did hit the like button subscribe and share with your family and friends subscribe button is up there I think on that side I've got a video playing over there of my last video click on that to be taken to more deliciousness thanks for watching and I'll see you guys on a next episode of this grand line", "GidsJbZdioA": "hey guys welcome back to breeze baking so yeah today we are making peanut butter cups so uh yeah so my halloween i'm gonna do a halloween video like probably sometime uh next week so watch that on my breeze playing series okay so um yeah so i'm excited for halloween um we got we are making peanut butter cups so i have a special guest that will be helping me make these because uh they're kind of hard to make um if you're a kid by yourself so my dad dad are you hungry yeah okay uh melting the hershey's we're gonna melt the hair that's the first step so you can use chocolate chips or hershey's but i thought i find that hershey's probably turned out better so do you want me to open our videos sure okay and what are we using a double boiler is that what it's called uh boiling water from there okay oh i think i got it okay um here you go your dad and uh put that in there think garbage right here for now uh so uh yeah i'm just gonna keep on going uh i think that should be enough for now yeah okay hey guys so we got everything into uh the things that they need we have some peanut butter is this a cup yeah a cup of peanut butter um how much of margarine is this one one cup of margarine uh or it's butter well you can use margarine or butter and uh graham crackers two cups of ground two cups of graham crackers and now we're just going to put how much icing sugar we're gonna put two cups of icing sugar okay two cups of icing sugar there's one so guys so for the halloween video um it's going to be so awesome because um i'm excited to show you my costume uh but i can't tell you right now because i want it to be a surprise and my brother's costume is awesome too and we don't know what my dad's gonna be yeah so i'm gonna pour this into here there there you want to put that in there okay [Music] there perfect and then i can put the peanut butter in here okay there is the chocolate melting right now yeah so the chocolate's still melting kind of takes a little bit we can stir this up okay can i stir [Music] my dad's just washing his hands this is hard work to stir guys so if you are making the this like if you're a little kid you should get a ground up top for like maybe the whole thing because it's kind of hard uh i'm gonna stir yeah so hey guys we're back uh we are just finished mixing this uh peanut butter cup uh inside i'm gonna smell it it smells exactly like the peanut butter cups you get at the store mmm yummy i want to taste it yeah we're going to make this done yeah okay now what are we going to do so we are going to get all these spoons and uh we're going to put it into the they're probably gonna be not exactly like the two different cups at the store because it'll be like mega peanut butter cups but there is makeup peanut butter cups but these will be mega mega because i've never ever seen peanut butter cups that big before so oh dad you got a little peanut butter cupcake yeah we'll get on there okay so uh yeah you got a skeleton right here i don't know if you guys can see yeah and we have a pumpkin over here so yeah i think you should check the chocolate there and see what we're doing just do a little syrup i'm gonna stir the chocolate bag i see like a few like more chocolate pieces that are not boiled yet guys so this part is hot so if there is a kid baking if there is a kid making these uh make sure maybe like uh help the kids stir this like it's like a very little kid because if you don't if you do something wrong like they accidentally put their hand in this it could boil their hand really bad so yeah just okay i think it's good i'm just gonna put it right here yeah okay okay guys so we have are we flat in the mall so we have a pot holder under this pot just so it doesn't burn the counter and then we're just gonna scoop the chocolate that melted into the just pour it on the yeah okay this is gonna be so good guys i can already tell uh so yeah we're just dad can i do one sure okay um which one could i do right there's a good one okay uh do i need a little more second that

and we just went to McDonald's and got a McDonald's breakfast okay yeah okay I went over to visit my family the other day and my brother handed me this he said mom ate one dad ate one and I ate one the fourth one is for you well I guess that's why they call it a share pack when I did this review today there's two things we're gonna fact-check number one well Butterfinger peanut butter cups get stuck in your teeth nope and number two one cup will leave you satisfied please note that since my mother ripped the package open we spent a lot of time scotch taping it back together okay let's rip that scotch tape back open again okay well the first thing I noticed that I don't really like is there's no wax paper on this peanut butter cup well I guess I'll just have to do a mod on it with these cupcake papers okay that's a little more of what I'm used to in a peanut butter cup I've seen a lot of people on YouTube eat their peanut butter cups in a slightly barbaric manner but I'm going to use utensils it'll be a lot more civilized okay I've prepared a little table setting here for the peanut butter cup boy I can hardly wait this is gonna taste good well as far as the taste test I'm gonna give it two thumbs up will Butterfinger peanut butter cups get stuck in your teeth well there's a little in there but it's not as bad as eating a Butterfinger bar however their claim that one cup will leave you satisfied that falls short I want another one right now and my family ate the other three I guess Butterfinger never counted on weird Paul I'm sorry Butterfinger I guess I'm gonna have to

chocolate do you love peanut butter do you love salty chocolate peanut butter cups then you are going to love this homemade reese's recipe here is the list of ingredients [Music] combine the ingredients into a mixing bowl and give it a good stir until it is super smooth [Music] i then proceeded to spoon out the peanut butter filling onto some parchment paper this time the peanut butter mixture was kind of runny so it made things go pretty quickly i used that cupcake liner as a size reference side note all of these peanut butter blobs are way too big i ended up making them way too large give it a little tap down to spread out the peanut butter then whisk it away into the fridge while those are chilling and getting harder start measuring out the chocolate and melting it follow the instructions on the package but i heated it on defrost then spoon the chocolate into the cupcake liners making sure to coat the bottom evenly you want a medium thin layer on the bottom this of course is going to be the bottom of your homemade reese's again give it a little tap to spread out the chocolate and this is what it looks like when it's all settled to the bottom and it's starting to set up note the thickness on the bottom layer note the thickness again all right our peanut butter patties have become pretty solid in the fridge next just place them into the cupcake liners ideally there would be a ring of chocolate around the edge i ended up making all those peanut butter patties way too big now we can start melting our chocolate for the top layer we're almost done [Music] proceed to spoon the chocolate onto the reese's i ended up using about one and a half cups of chocolate wafers on the bottom and about one and a half cups on the top here's a look at our final product after it's set up and it looks kind of like a homemade reese's uh the fruits of our labor delicious [Music] you", "WO4pNgSYw9A": "peanut butter chocolate you got peanut butter on my chocolate too

different increments of 15 to 30. pack your mixture and then cover it and there you go easy peasy i did have some extra peanut butter filling so i formed them to the balls and used some butterscotch

welcome back i'm avery lauren and i'm so excited for my new video today because i'm going to be showing you guys how to make reese's peanut butter cups and they're going to be so good and i've never made them before so it's the first time for all of us but i'm very excited to try these and i think you guys are going to enjoy these too so let's just get right into it okay so what you're going to need is some peanut butter and i just have jiff and then you're going to need some scissors some almond bark some cupcake liners preferably tin foil ones but we didn't have any so i'm just gonna spray them with a tiny bit of pam so you if you don't have tin foil ones then you want pam and i also have a bowl and you're going to need a cupcake tin pan it looks like this so i've got one of these and we're just going to start making them alright so i'm here with all my stuff and so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to take your liners and you're just going to put them inside of the pan okay there we go next we're going to just take a little bit of pam or cooking spray and we're going to spray the insides of all the liners but not with very much because you don't want your peanut butter cups to taste buttery all right now we're going to take the almond bark and go ahead and open it up and i just have some plain almond bark here and we're going to take about two or three squares i'm gonna start with two but if i need more i'll just melt the third one but we're gonna start with two squares and we're gonna melt them in the microwave at 30 second intervals so if you don't know what a 30 second interval is you're gonna cook it in the microwave for 30 seconds then you're just gonna pull it out and stir it and then you're gonna put it back in for 30 seconds and continue doing that until it's all the way melted okay i've got my two squares and i'm just gonna throw them in the microwave real quick for 30 seconds and stir it up all righty it's all melted and it only took me about three times i think it was to put it in the microwave to get it to all the way melts now we're just gonna take the chocolate and we're gonna pour a little layer of it into the bottom of the tins so just the bottom layer of each pin is going to be covered with some chocolate then you want to wait just a little bit because you don't want your chocolate to completely harden but you want to harden a little bit because you're going to add peanut butter next and you don't want the peanut butter to fall to the bottom of it because then it's not like packed inside i guess so we're going to wait just a few minutes and then when the chocolate is a little bit harder we're going to put in the peanut butter hey guys so while we're waiting i decided we're going to do a little fun thing on how well do you know me so there's a whole bunch of cards in this box of questions and i will reveal answers in a later video but i'm going to ask you a whole bunch of questions and i want you guys to tell me the answers to each question in the comments and i want you to guess and then i'll shout out anyone who's right so let's just do a few of these shall we okay not that one can't do the first thing because they don't invite me okay question number one am i a cat person or a dog person question number two have i ever broken a bone question number three which would i rather choose to live in a hot place like a super warm place or a super cold place question number four i don't think very many of you are gonna get this because it's never in any of my videos but we'll see maybe my friends will get it i know i have a few friends who watch my videos who just might get these so this question is what's my nickname do i like it or do i hate it do i play any musical instruments and if so how many this one i only think i have one friend who's actually going to guess this and i don't know if she will will even try and guess but we'll see so this question is what is my current favorite tv show oh and i love this one so yeah i hope you guys guess these right go ahead and try in the comments right now and then we'll continue our video all right you guys we're back here with our chocolate that's slightly cooled and we've got some peanut butter so some of the chocolates have cooled all the way and some of them are like halfway through so we're just going to start with cooled ones we've got this first in here and basically what you're gonna do let me come closer you're just gonna take it and take some peanut butter and you're just gonna put the peanut butter right in the center and you can really choose how much peanut butter you want i'm just doing like a half tablespoon tablespoonish maybe i'm gonna need a second spoon to get all the peanut butter off but i might do a little less than this for my other ones but basically you're just putting little dollops of peanut butter in and just spreading them kind of around the bottom and then once you put in the peanut butter you're going to you're gonna take some more chocolate and you're gonna pour it over the top of the peanut butter so you can cover it all up and turn it into a peanut butter cup all right even here we are with our final almost products it's a little messy now but we've got chocolate and then peanut butter and then more chocolate on top and i just kind of smoothed it out so it all covered it evenly and now we're going to take it and put it in the freezer so that way it'll harden faster and i'll get back to you once it's completely hardened can't wait okay so i just pulled them out of the freezer and they're completely hardened they look super good just for reference this took me about an hour to like freeze them all the way so now i'm just gonna pull them out of the tins and transfer them to a plate okay guys and here is the final product of course i will be doing a close-up for you guys and i'm super excited about these these look super good and we're gonna try them okay guys i'm here with my reese's peanut butter cup and i'm gonna try it now this is super good you guys this is really good you guys should definitely try this and let me know if you do try this a recommendation my mom gave me was to add powdered sugar to the peanut butter because it'll make you like stand up better and it'll kind of give it like a better picture yeah so that was my recommendation but these are super good comment down below if you try these and please consider subscribing thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all next week bye [Music]",

want to see me drink recipes you want to see me cook pumping anything thank you so much for watching", "edSyDyE9wWs": "I've been talking a lot lately about alternatives for holidays for recipes that are really healthy today we're gonna be talking about nutty butter cups I'm going to show you how to make that all you need is some sugar-free dairy-free chocolate I use our brain and love bars and I'm going to be showing you those and you need a little bit of almond or cashew butter if you're allergic to nuts you can use some butter so let's jump into it so nutty butter cups are absolutely one of my favorite desserts to make for several reasons one they're super easy there are two ingredients too they're really versatile they really work for any holiday for any party that you're having they just throw and they're a favorite so for my family my daughter's friends for sleepovers everybody seems to love them so you need about four ounces of melted chocolate of course I'm partial to ours brain and love because they're dairy free and sugar free very clean chocolate so I'm gonna melt it really depends on how much how many of these cups you're gonna make so I'm gonna melt about four ounces or actually more like six ounces right now I'm just gonna break it up dump it in a bowl now if you want to really burn proof your chocolate I'm in a microwave it you can definitely use a double boiler if you want to and if you put about you know teaspoon into two teaspoons of coconut oil depending on how much chocolate you have you know for an ounce to two ounces I'd say no more than a teaspoon a little bit more you can put a little bit more coconut oil but it makes the chocolate really forgiving so it doesn't burn and when you put it in the refrigerator or freezer it will set up really nicely and now 15 to 20 second intervals the reason you don't want to put it in longer you need to take it out every 15 to 20 seconds to stir it to make sure it's not burning so it takes about you just a little over a minute of doing that in intervals and you should have perfectly melted chocolate all right so now we're ready to fill the little cups with chocolate you're gonna fill the bottom only so you're gonna take a spoon like so so once you have the number of cups that you want to fill the bottoms covered with chocolate you need to put it in the freezer you know it really only takes with the chocolate and the coconut oil about two to three minutes but I'd say five minutes just to be safe put it in there so it hardens up and says so that you when you put the nut butter in it'll sit nice and firm you don't want it to smash down so I'm gonna put this in the freezer for just a couple of minutes and I'll be right back so now that the chocolate the bottom is set we're gonna now we're gonna put the nut butter into the bottom of the cups you're just gonna take a small spoon and you want to make sure it's about 1/2 of a teaspoon you don't want to get too much if you get too much you won't be able to cover the top of it with the chocolate the nut butter will seep out the sides and it won't look like a peanut butter cup so you want it to sort of look like a you know a regular peanut butter cup it's probably a little too much about that much about 1/2 teaspoon now you might have to heat your chocolate up for about 10 to 15 seconds if it starts to set it needs to be nice and melted once we're done with that we're gonna fill the top with chocolate make sure the chocolate goes all the way around the sides of the nut butter just take your chocolate and Syl and you want to get they don't have to go all the way to the top but make sure you at least go over the top of the almond butter or cashew butter whatever you're using perfect I'm gonna put this in the freezer usually after about 10 to 15 minutes they're ready to go and then I'll show you the final product so this is what they will look like when they're finished they look like a peanut butter cup now you can actually put them like I said in different decorative cups so for different holidays whether it's Christmas or Valentine's Day Halloween whatever they work for any occasion and that's what I love about them so those are nutty butter cups these are a favorite of my friends and family would love to hear the reaction of your friends and family you can post photos for me send me some comments also you can find us on on Facebook on Instagram and I would just really love to connect with you I want to know more about what you think about these", "c4l9IsHg1-I": "[Music] hi guys so welcome to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're stopping by and for the rest of you guys welcome back so today I'm going to show you a great recipe pretty much most you guys will have these ingredients at home your classic peanut butter recipe crab peanut butter cookies mother so yeah I tasted one the food so check these out so it's not nice check that out and then these I just did is a pinwheel kind of decoration for Halloween I thought would be fun so I'll show you how to do that if you'd like and yeah let's just jump right into those ingredients and get started oh one day I want to say it's what's nice about this recipe is you can use it with a variance of great ingredients I'll get more into that with the ingredients but if you've got cannabutter can of sugar can of flour can is shortening pretty much you can use any one or all of those combinations so as I said this is a great recipe to do simple easy no major equipment involved you know who said easy ingredients so let's get started alright so for our peanut butter cups what we are going to need is a half a cup of peanut butter now what I would recommend is all-natural peanut butter because that way you don't have as much sugar and some of you have no sugar and that's added salt to it and you're gonna have a much nicer tasting peanut cookie versus the commercial but if that's what you got no problem at all but like I said the old Naturals nice way to go with that because we do add all that other sugar so not necessarily needed in your peanut butter so I'll start again here so we'll go 1/2 a cup of peanut butter a quarter cup of shortening now I did Kanna infused shortening so that's what I'm using here a quarter cup of butter unsalted butter now you can use cannabutter obviously so 1/4 cup of can of that's what you've got one egg and you'd like it you want your egg at room temperature because if you had a very cold egg to butter it makes it go all lumpy and you don't want that in your cookies you're going to want a half a cup of brown sugar a half a cup of white sugar granulated white sugar or if you've got Candida like I've got I did a quarter cup of canna and a quarter cup of white then you want three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder sorry baking soda I always confuse those two we've got about three-quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and then you want one and a quarter cups of flour then really for equipment just a hand mixer stand mixer you can absolutely do this by hand parts lined cookie sheet one of these scoops make it really nice so you can make nice even cookies spatula and that's about it and what I'm gonna try want to try and see if I can do some Halloween coloured one so I want to do black and orange see if I can do them in as a pinwheel not sure if it'd work out but we'll find out together and other than that let's get started all right so the first thing we're gonna add is our butter and sugar and get those blended together so we're going to use our peanut butter and our butter and our shortening that's my peanut butter i quarter cup of shortening quarter cup of butter and you want to make sure that the butter and the shortening or at room temperature and we're going to put in our half a cup of packed brown sugar and our half a cup of where my quarter can and my quarter white sugar or you just a half a cup of white sugar and attached our paddle and get those blended together first OOP salsify plug it in electricity is an important thing so I'm just gonna blend that I'm excited until it's all well blended together and then we're going to add our room temperature a scrape down four inches I'm so not a neat person out of her egg and I will just get that blended in just scrape down your edges and now we're going to add in our salt baking soda and baking powder I like to blend those together before adding in the flour so that way to make sure that they get well blended and not get clumped into the flour [Music] he don't do that turn the blender off the mixer off and once that's well mix we're going to add in our flour and again we're just going to blend this tool that gets mixed together and becomes a dough [Music] clean off our side make sure your bowl is attached reattach my bowl scoop that down just gonna give it a final blend get everything front mixed together hopefully my ball will stay attached they kind of bent it making bagels one day you're not really supposed to need bagels in this so when you're when you're up if you know it starts to come together like this it's all coming together nicely and a taker get some saran wrap and we're just gonna put this in the fridge to chill for one to two hours or until it's firm so this is what your dough should basically be looking like mmm nice and pliable now what I'm gonna do cuz I said I'm gonna try that experiment I'm gonna split half of my dough I'm gonna do my colors and let them set separately and yeah I'm gonna try the pinwheel thing so just make sure to wrap it up really well and put that into the refrigerator for one to two hours I still sit until it's firm all right so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna split these I have no idea if the color is gonna take or not we're gonna find out really quick so I've used I'm using oil base colors but I'm sure gel colors would work just as well just trying to get this need to get the color needed in yeah many is parties so I'm just working this tool it all becomes an even color now you don't have to wait well I'm get it fully even because as it sets the color will spread out try the orange you probably rubber gloves or plastic gloves would be better doing this but of course I wouldn't think that ahead of time again I'm just gonna need this until the color all it gets worked through there we go Sunday's kind of pumpkin orange happenin now I'm gonna put these two sets think I'm gonna roll them out first a lot I think that might work better because they're more pliable now and then how lose sets that way so I'm gonna just set this aside did you use two pieces of saran wrap grab my rolling pin now this rolling pin is awesome because you put the disks on it and it'll roll it to exactly that size so they're like an eighth of an inch quarter or half inch it's really nice for those of us who cannot roll straight one do the orange then I'm gonna take the black one hey if I took off the top layer of my black player there and I'm gonna try and very gently lay this on top of the orange it is very delicate well I didn't work out according to plan that's okay we can fix it doesn't need to be pretty and then tossed it back on top here and you want to be very gentle so to roll you want to have keep it on the Saran wraps on the back and you roll it with the saran wrap kind of like doing a great role in a great big you-know-what and as you work just pull the plastic away it doesn't have to be that pretty just want to get it together because we're going to let that set in the fridge want to make sure it's together it's good rolled in the plastic even around a little bit we take the ends like that wisdom and it loose that's not making a sausage I'm going to put that in the fridge to set for when I meet with the other dough there and we'll be back and we'll cut these up and portion out the our cookies alright flora dough is ready we're gonna preheat our oven to 350 degrees and we're gonna set up our cookies and get them beat alright so aren't cookie dough with that so I like I'd like to use the small scoop not the smallest percolated I guess I don't know small medium scoop this way it gives us the perfect size and so just grab a scoop of your dough even or all you want to make sure that they're nice all evenly on the same side now I've got one of these baking mats and I'm going to try half with the parchment paper and half of the baking mat I want to see if it makes any difference see if this because the mats are supposed to bake them better so we'll find it so you're just gonna scoop that out and then once you got all your little balls on there for your closet peanut butter recipe just take your pork go down one way oops that was in the way and then just crisscross you just want to make sure to have enough space between them because they will spread out baby 1 now you do check out the pinwheels let's hope this work alright just gonna get a knife so you can use one of these straightedge cutter or source straightedge night first just take the end off I got nothing in there Oh check that out let's see how they bake up all right so we're gonna pop these toughest into the oven in your preheated oven of 350 and for 8 to 12 minutes or until they are lightly golden brown and I just want to pick up any any of the excess cookie just stick it back on if there is and we'll be back shortly and see how these puppies come out so ten minutes I check out my cookies so you want that I said just that nice light golden brown and we're gonna let those cool so I'm just gonna slide these over very gently to a cooling rack over here and we're just gonna let these cool for about 20 minutes to a half hour and we'll come back and give these guys a little tester all right check out this bad boy ooh let's give her a taste oh my god these are so good oh you got to give this recipe a try ma'am oh I'm gonna be eating cookies tonight so guys that's my demonstration there on some just classic peanut butter cookies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions or any at all please don't hesitate to put them you know we're down below and to thank you so much for joining me you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "ssLX1I7DtNs": "early in the 20th century an American biscuit company introduced a cookie sandwich it was two chocolate cookies with rich vanilla icing at the center this sandwich cookie created an instant sensation and almost a century later it hasn't lost its appeal people still crave this sugary fusion of crunch and cream dipping the sandwich cookie and milk is a tasty tradition and whoever started it must have been one smart cookie sandwich cook you start with pure granulated sugar this worker heaps bags of it into a mixer as he prepares to whip up the batter for the wafers he adds two kinds of cocoa the combination will give the wafers the desired taste and color a pre mix of salt and other ingredients follows a specially formulated canola oil mixture will transform these dry ingredients into a batter as huge beaters blend everything together they add water and the batter starts to look like a bubbling chocolate soup [Music] they add dry ice which chills the batter as it evaporates the lower temperature is key as they add flour to thicken the batter into a dough the dough will turn out less crumbly than it would have been if it had been kept at room temperature a premix of leavening ingredients goes in next one final mix and this chocolate dough is ready to go the worker shovels it onto a grate which protects his fingers as he presses the dough down into a molding machine this machine shapes the dough into cookie wafers while pressing intricate designs and the brand name onto them it turns out an impressive five thousand chocolate wafers an hour [Music] the freshly molded cookie wafers now moved from the silicate conveyer to a steel one it takes the wafers into a gas oven where they travel in a continuous loop for several minutes to receive an even baking [Music] after that fans cool the way first to the desired Chris penis the chocolate wafers then moved to another conveyor which feeds into a series of chutes [Music] then the wafers travel over ramps designed to

zoey [Music] what are we going to do are we going to put it in those all right so i'm going to fill this up and you're gonna shoot some chocolate in each one good job we're doing it with this because the spoon was messy wasn't it the spoon is messy way too messy thank you you have no salted sip stuff doll okay girl and they fill in the seed sauce on 15 minutes for 15 minutes good job that way they can get um that they can solidify can you say solidify solidify that's right [Music] chocolate chops okay so while those are in the freezer for 15 minutes we're going to tell you a little bit about [Music] the products that we're using we are using enjoy life allergen free product it is free from gluten wheat peanuts tree nuts dairy casein soy eggs sesame sulfate lupin mustard mustard that's weird fish shellfish in crustaceans whenever i was breastfeeding zoey we had to go dairy free because um she had an intolerance to vary i don't think it's as bad nowadays but we chose to keep dairy out of our life because personal preference what is that peanut butter i normally shop at publix but lately i've been shopping at different grocery stores trying to cut down on our grocery bill i think this is a kroger brand i'm not really sure they can't see it hold it up code turn that coconut over bucket lighters mini muffin lighters maybe these are mini messengers and we're gonna top them off with some himalayan salt is it pink yep pink is whose favorite color is pink who's me yours okay so we're going to top it off with some ladies [Music] let's see how it is [Music] well i'm going to show you how to do this okay so now that they are all solidified stay in the front it's a little fun we're going to top them on we're gonna put some almond butter on them almond butter all right there we go it's like almond butter now let me do the pizza oh you want to do the pink stuff uh-huh what is that called um [Music] himalayan salt himalayan salt top it off with some more wood started chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate cake i needed to film in the season saturday [Music] oh all right let's go wash your hands before you put the salt on because it's starting now for this side you want to take a tiny little pinch and just put it like that okay just a tiny pinch and put it on each one there you go don't do the next one good job you know pinch go to that one the next one i'm putting them in the seats i are about it out off yes so we're going to put these in the freezer for about an hour and we're going to let them solidify can you say solidify what does solidify um mean it means they're going to harden yes right now they're liquid so they move so when they solidify they're going to be a solid so so they don't move that's right what do we have are these homemade we see what are they [Music] so the reason why you have to let them um freeze for an hour is because the peanut butter is not frozen all the way but it's okay um [Music] [Music] leave a

are going to try to do the one pound uh reese's challenge now i thought this was going to be easy challenges from all the videos i've seen the people i've seen do this until i actually put this thing i saw it in front of me this is this is this is pretty massive so now i'm thinking i'm not even gonna finish it it's gonna it's not gonna be easy i think i'm gonna end up with a uh sugar high i'm not gonna be able to do it i got henry i think henry here can bang this down in five minutes or under just because i know how he loves these things as far as me uh i don't see it happening but i'm gonna give it my best chance um we gotta time a set here just to see how long it takes there's no uh there's no set time it has to be done in it's just we're just going to see if how long it takes us to do it and hopefully the phone we don't run out of phone because we only got about 15 20 minutes left on the battery here but uh how you feeling honey feeling pretty good but you're uh what's your guess on taking this down i got you in under five i mean what do you think i really don't know i i really haven't tried to like go for the distance i just eat it to enjoy it well today you're going to be pounding it down like uh molly skyla hello i don't know have it done in 45 seconds that's probably what she would do but uh we are definitely not my sky although yeah or anybody for that matter competitive years by no means but uh we're gonna give it a whirl so let's uh open them up these are just they're so big i've never actually seen the packaging before big this heavy little pound of chocolate that's huge that's that's like a small pot pie it's like it's like almost like the size of a pot pie that's only one of them uh man i don't know i do not know if this was gonna happen they come out of the shell either yes they do they come out of the shell easy um they smell good they definitely smell good i'm not this i don't know why i'm like a little nervous i you know i don't want to like not be able to finish it and i get a feeling it's not going to be very easy uh to get finished but we shall see all right i'm gonna pull mine out get it ready to go are you ready henry any last words all right uh i don't know if you have a bell to the clock but we'll show you the time i said just let's just see how fast it gets on all right three two one go wow it's thick that's a lot of peanut butter so good it takes a little bit to get it down one minute 10 seconds in trying to be neat for sure 60 ml a little bit halfway down my first one i'm already getting like that too much sugar feeling everything i'm going to first one in two minutes exactly oh it's really filling okay three minutes wow hard don't forget to like share and subscribe four minutes in i'm just finishing my first one almost i can say i'm not finishing this whole one i don't think you got 20 seconds get that five minute mark so wow down okay about 5.45 [Music] i'm blasting what do you mean you're blasting it's way too much sweet for me even though it's not man you're getting vegan even though it's uh don't even worry about the time even though it's uh in 10 minutes even though it's uh i'm tasting mostly peanut butter i'm chewing it the chocolate is just killing me but it still tastes like a reese's doughnut it does it's too thick i'm i'm tapping right there how are you gonna finish it oh my goodness that's a lot of uh i really didn't think that that was gonna be an issue for me like i said watching this until you see it in front of you and actually see how big it is i mean these things like these are really almost the size of spot five but it's heavy it'll definitely be a good commitment to sit here and do that you have to really love the reese's like he i know he really loves the reese's uh guy ain't no competitor to you by any means this is just uh it's too much too much chocolate i'm not i'm not a chocolate person to begin with and i'm actually tasting more peanut butter as i'm eating it but on my teeth it's like so sweet from the chocolate part of it it's so much i mean i got this it's just so much you know i don't know if you can see that in there this it's thick it's big like when i've seen it on other videos it doesn't look that big when they're doing it until it's until it's in front of you that's uh that's some work right there man you uh and it took you what would it take you when you did it in the 545 was it [Applause] so i know that's uh it takes some time to get it down it's like it sticks to your whole mouth it's like real thick once it's inside your mouth it's no joke it's a great joke i ran out of milk like how do you feel like your gut oh i'm good i'm really full and i actually uh ate light on purpose because i knew this was gonna be filling one of these is uh well again it's a they reach a half a pound that's a half a pound of sweet peanut butter and chocolate it started out tasting really good actually i was like i heard you say it was so good well if it wasn't easy but uh yeah guys check this out uh give it a shot something you can do i mean i'm sure if i sat here i could have finished this but it took me like a half hour probably because i'm going to get slower so i'm so full and the sweetness really does bother me a lot i'm not i don't really i'm not a huge sweet either to begin with so uh that just wasn't for me but uh that's pretty much it guys you have it there it's the uh one pound reese's challenge henry got it done in about five minutes 45 seconds he was off i was off about 45 seconds on what i thought he was gonna do it and and uh but he got it done uh like i said i sure could have finished that but there's no sense sitting here for uh 20 more minutes watching me try to bang that down and just feel terrible the rest of the night and i'll be taking that to work tomorrow yeah that's a dessert so you put it back it all looks full like it looked like today doesn't look like i did much in that second one but i can feel it but uh that's it guys we appreciate uh check out the videos uh want to thank henry for being in this video and until next time this is mike from empty reviews and more we'll see

you're thinking this is only the nectar to gods is some call it only the finest Mountain Dew kickstart big curveball massive massive curve ball that's not what we're reviewing today no no today's review is for Oreo trying to be excited about this it is some limited edition peanut butter cup fillet the Klem Oreos missus peanut butter cop set is again I apologize about the computer still being a little bit but uh moolah we'll get things taken care of hoping on I mean by taken care of get this open somehow it says whipped here lift easy open full time alright there's my nation\u00eds trying to get open a package so if the panelling tastes like Reese's Peanut Butter Cup with cream Oreos does that look appealing all right I don't know how we can see that it's not just a camera boy does that look real peeling one side is 10 and the other side is great boy does that look good nothing like some great filling on your Oreo dump from my recollection I remember Reese's peanut butter cups being gray none of these are like some sort of factory defect or this how that's supposed to be will just be them I guess it supposed to taste like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup well they taste like the package specified it did they lie to us did Oreo crush all of our hopes and dreams and finally after all these long decades finally attaining that Reese's Peanut Butter Cup or will they ruin everything no no now does this does this really taste like a fresh you know you know Reese's Peanut Butter Cup no does resemble it though I'm not sure about the flavoring I just want to kind of try something I want to try a little bit of each each type of flavoring see if there's a difference between the gray flavoring and the tan fly around make sense so pretty much you saw there's a great flow from the tan flavoring for each cooking the great flavoring is the chocolate on the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup you know that's on the outside whereas a tan flavoring is the peanut butter flavor itself no yes it does taste like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup however one thing I do need to tell you about these cookies is that you have to factor in the cookie itself which is of a chocolate flavor so one thing that you're gonna notice yes they do taste peanut buttery very realistic it does taste and so you aren't eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup with one exception would you have to take note of is yes there they do include the chocolate frosting ie the gray frosting but you also have to take note of this the cookie which is also a chocolate present a chocolate EU flavor one could say you know crispy cookie you're not even getting that I hope well you got a faction in the cookie dough it does dilute it in a sense it doesn't that taste like your pure Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but the cookie does mix in does create a more chocolaty flavor and you know that's one thing you need to be aware of so the peanut butter flavor itself it's a little bit drowned out it's there it's always a bowl you could definitely taste it but that's not as strong as I would have expected it to be and you got to blame the Oreo cookie for it nothing else you can blame so yeah that's one thing about it otherwise it really does taste very realistic it does definitely taste like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup every other regard do you know the color of the you know the frosting is it is unappealing you know grey frosting it is what it is though but it is unappealing yeah that's one thing one thing bad but otherwise it's alright price-wise you can get the whole package for about five bucks at any supermarket limited edition I believe that's worth a try overall though not too bad and not too bad at all out of ten I'm gonna give this an eight point four out of ten pretty good overall just a little bit visually unappealing and in a sense the flavor is a little bit diluted otherwise though fine player fine cookie I recommend it good value thank you so much watching this is rolling up to your food review and today we reviewed Oreos in addition Reese's Peanut Butter Cup flavor Krim thank you so very much for watching take care this is running empty in food of you and I'm your host Airport",

liners a mixing bowl and a hand mixer if you have one if you don't that's totally fine you can just use a mixing spoon and you're also going to need some teaspoon measures [Music] for ingredients i've already pre-measured mine and they're ready to go so i have 16 ounces or about two and a half cups of chocolate chips 1 4 of a cup of powdered sugar 1 4 teaspoon of salt one half teaspoon of vanilla extract a half cup of peanut butter and one tablespoon of coconut oil if you don't have this it's totally fine you could just leave it out so for the first step i'm going to mix the peanut butter powdered sugar vanilla extract and salt in a mixing bowl and i'm going to mix them until they're well combined with my hand mixer if you don't have a hand mixer you can just mix them all together with a mixing spoon now i'm going to mix the coconut oil with my chocolate chips and microwave it in 30 second increments stirring in between until the chocolate is completely melted if you don't have the coconut oil you can just leave it out and just melt the chocolate now i'm going to spoon about a half of a tablespoon of the melted chocolate into each liner and then swirl the chocolate to make sure that it covers the whole bottom of the muffin liner now i'm going to place the muffin tin in the freezer for about five minutes to let the chocolate harden now that my chocolate is all set i'm going to take about a half of a tablespoon of the peanut butter and form a disc that's just smaller than the mold so that there's room for the chocolate to go around the edges then i'm going to place the peanut butter disk in the center of each chocolate base now i'm going to put about one to two teaspoons of the remaining melted chocolate over the peanut butter layer and then use a spoon to spread it evenly now i'm going to stick these back in the freezer for about 5 to 10 minutes to completely harden now that my peanut butter cups are completely set i'm going to take them out of the liners and just set them on a plate and that is how you make your very own homemade peanut butter cups i hope you enjoyed making these and enjoy this tasty little treat the peanut butter cups can be stored in the fridge for up to four days thank you so much for watching bye", "wJacskAaQoQ": "hey guys how are you Stephanie aka AG so I do have some messages for you guys that I'm supposed to put out this morning I saw a vision of the Reese's Pieces chocolate I don't eat that chocolate you know and I'm not gonna say that um all chocolate bars are bad or all chocolate bars are good we all know that you know sweets are not the healthiest decision but um hey you know we eat chocolate candy we eat all that stuff you know um however what I'm gonna say is that when I did see the Reese's I knew that wasn't a message for me I knew God was giving me that message for someone and what I heard was not good okay thumbs down not good and so I'm not sure if this is something that if this is a specific type of ingredient that's in this chocolate that's not good and like I said I know not all chocolates are the best decision but when I see stuff like this and something is specifically shown to me it means that there is gonna be either a recall on the item or it means that there's something specifically in it that's a lot more toxic than like all the other kinds of chocolates do you get what I'm saying or maybe like a period of time around this period of time whatever batch that's being put into stores currently may not be the best kind of batch right or it can also mean like we'll see stuff on the media relating to this but this is definitely for someone as to Reese's peanut butter cups I saw the chocolate and I was told it's not good and not to eat it but that message wasn't for me like I said before cuz I don't eat that right so this is definitely for someone um you know or this could be just like a warning or spoil hear something about it later on the other thing that I saw was shown to me was we're gonna hear something very soon relating to Apple so this could be like a new Apple product coming out or this can be like something going on with a poll that we're gonna see in the media some type of information coming out and then what I also saw was I saw a number the number looked like 43 or 73 I didn't really see the first number but I saw the three beside it but I it kind of came in it like went away really quickly so it was either a four or a seven but I know there was a three next to it and it and then I saw the Apple sign that we see on a computer on the cell phones and all that stuff right so there's something going on with Apple with the number 43 or 73 and I feel strongly this can be that we're getting here something in the media about Apple sort of a news but this can also be stock if you're in the stock market and you are I'm not in the Apple stock market right so this is for someone who isn't in probably in the Apple stock market this could be a message for that specifically if there's numbers next to it right it could mean that it's gonna go up very soon because I actually just checked the Apple stock market and it's not really doing the best right now so it may mean that it there's gonna be a huge jump if there's anybody in the Apple stock market so I'm just putting it out for you okay yeah but if it's that fast not what it is there's we're gonna hear some news relating to an Apple product or something related to Apple okay the next thing that I saw was I saw two lighters okay I saw a clear lighter and I saw a purple liner and what I was told was for whoever you are who has that clear lighter or that purple lighter I was told to put it up put it up very high out of reach away from anything flammable away from like hairspray or away from like you know I keep it very safe away from the stove or away from the heater or you know what I mean and I was just told to specifically put it away I know we're supposed to be safe anyways with stuff like that but like I said when I get specific messages like this and you know it's common sense to keep stuff like that put away but we all make mistakes sometimes we do leave things laying around here and there you know but like I said when I get messages like that it is very important for someone who's going to be listening and it can possibly save someone's life okay so that's what me putting it out but yeah I saw the two lighters I saw clear one and I saw a purple one and I was told put it up safely away from you know anything kids you know put away from anything flammable and you know it's just it's just just that extra reminder I guess you know but the fact like I said the fact that it was shown to me definitely something important related to that okay thank you guys so much so I will talk to you guys soon if I get any messages or information I will keep you guys posted thank you guys bye", "LzRMdO_HrqI": "[Music] hey yo guys so today I'm gonna be giving you a review on on Rails dark chocolate peanut butter cups little ways some are for you and Justin star chocolate peanut butter cups and these are lower in carbs and then I'm also going to be comparing it next to Reese's peanut butter cups so get going so I'm gonna grab one of those and then so there's one that's so that let me look at the counter the card is real quick so for Reese's is less than 12 cars per one piece the only difference it is that the rhesus is milk chocolate not dark chocolate and dark chocolate is better for you guys and then on wheels peanut butter cups they're gonna be six carbs so we'll compare the size of sizing and everything to guys just feel better cups is well for this one for two pieces is 11 carbs so and they're smaller but so they all come in different so this was for Justin's this was the unreal one and then this is the you know your normal peanut butter races so two of these would actually cool one of Gracie's and then let's see if I got in reality if I got two of these so that'd be like so in two of these would also equal treatment Reese's so that's just like you know good lawyer my throat clear palette so these are like the unreal and intestines and then this is Reese's okay so I should try Reese's first I couldn't bear my my my mmm breezes are so good I can't have too many though like I don't see how people are just like popping them in their mouth like after a psych just alive okay and then this is unreal so very similar to them or you sees you can Emily does dark chocolate but it does not taste like the feeling of the Reese's peanut butter now first I was like this really taste that great oh if I wasn't comparing it next to Reese's I think it would actually be really like you know really good so I might go back to the Reese's what's your greatest favor like chocolate like there's more chocolate milk chocolate dark chocolate coming on down below I like I like dark chocolate lot more now since I like when I started doing about carb and there was what other chuckles that I could have set you know like you learned to get used to it and it it wasn't bad but let's see before that though like oh man guys I love white chocolate I really liked my chocolate okay mr. Issa so so this is justin's so the peanut butter filling is on inside okay i do like their dark chocolate better than the unreal it isn't like as like bitter [Music] okay so you know that uh peanut butter where I like that filling it's like powdery so now I was gonna like sit weird cuz I quit the Reese's just you know kind of like moist and like together and so it's a the unreal Swan but this one is like you chewed on this kinda like it's just like powder yes that's interesting cuz it looks like get us all together in there but am I here you know it like has this like bit of like a coffee flavor so that's interesting okay so I would say it may be like the closest but like maybe would be Justin's peanut butter close to like the Reese's or like you know kind of like the same feeling and on Rails it's like if you like the dark really dark chocolate on wheels for you if not in you're still trying to like have do lower-carb it would be Justin's so well that's pretty much it guys and

little that's it for this review I'm going to share with everybody so everybody have a good one thanks for your support have a good one bye bye", "Ool3cZlMo60": "hey guys so as you know I am a big fan of trying foreign candy and chocolates and such and one particular thing that I have fallen in love with these Reese's peanut butter cups as you can see giant bag purchase is such a mammoth bag of Reese's peanut butter cups even for me it could get a little overwhelming so what I've taken too lightly is actually baking these into a tasty little treats on the six weeks is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup muffin which I have improvised for my muffin recipe I really love which I think tastes pretty damn great I don't share with you before you begin pre-heat your oven to 190 degrees Celsius or if you're working on Fahrenheit which I actually am because my house strangely has a really old Fahrenheit based oven it's about 375 degrees Fahrenheit now to begin with we are going to combine all of our dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl two cups of flour one to one-and-a-half teaspoons baking powder 3/4 of a cup of raw sugar a tablespoon of cocoa and about half a teaspoon of cinnamon plus I couldn't just give a couple extra shakes that's movement because I love cinnamon mix up all of the dry ingredients are so they're nice and combined and we moved on that make a well in the center in preparation of our wet ingredients just kind of a little something like that now for our wet ingredients we have one and a quarter cups of milk 1 egg preferably room-temperature lightly beaten I'm three tablespoons of melted butter mix all that together and it stays you can also add in your Reese's peanut butter cups obviously I am using the miniature peanut butter cups and into the mixture I put about eighteen cut into little quarters I know Reese's peanut butter cups would be super expensive to buy anywhere outside all of the states I actually got these months for a really good price however the 56 ounce bag came from Costco for $16 I think he's pretty good value a mixture will feel a little bit greasy just because they're using raw sugar but that's okay it gives the muffin a nice texture in the end no need to mix it too much just until everything is combined and this recipe makes 12 so a regular whole cup baking pan is fine I like to bake my muffins in paper pens just for ease I know you obviously want to do now is just evenly distribute the muffin mix between the twelve pens so they're gonna look a little something like this and they're not what I like to at the end is a sprinkle a few more little chopped up pieces of miniature peanut butter cups on top like so and those are ready to go into your preheated oven for about 20 minutes you will have something that looks a little bit like this so that's it they are extremely easy to make and extremely tasty as well seriously these are amazing if you happen to know of any other candy based recipes I would love to know about it and try it out or perhaps where you're from is simply famous for a particular sweet or dessert let me know I'd love to find out is one of my life missions to try as many worldly sweets as I can anywho that's it for now guys I've got some muffins to eat so I'll see you next time", "-4JKY7a2DcI": "So what are we going to make?

peanut butter cups I've never tried these before something to eat them let's open them up and see what they look like I don't really know what they are like things as I'd say I've never eaten them before running this thing open the packet yet alone eat it right oh it smells like peanut butter that's a good sign there we go all working everyone gone there's every 30 dozen so here it is the peanut butter cup thing it's going to sit now all in one cuz we're not over it I don't like being a ball but a ton pay union that you really like them sent out of 10 would fly again what they ask is there a talk that code though I've got peanut butter in the middle and they're just chocolate basically it's very nice um yeah Reese's peanut butter cups very good when I will see later bye", "kinCdGaTWNI": "what is up guys how's it going my name is Andre and today I'm going to show you how you can make at home anabolic peanut butter cups so unlike regular Reese's peanut butter cups they're not full of saturated fats and sugars and they have only 100 calories per cup so the ingredients to start off are obviously peanut butter or preferably PB to pivot fit or some kind of peanut butter powder why use powdered form because they're reduced in fat and they have lower calories can make it with regular peanut butter it will have around 180 calories so keep that in mind so if you're going to use pivot to perk up you should have two tablespoons or 14 grams or if you use regular peanut butter per cup you're going to have 20 grams of peanut butter and the best kind is natural just peanuts and nothing else may be soft so the other thing is we're going to need our dark chocolate so you'll also need some kind of sweetener we're going to use stevia because zero calories you can substitute it for something else that has zero calories you'll also need a teaspoon of vanilla extract and we're going to be using some sort of protein powder I'm going to use pea protein you can substitute it for some other kind of protein or not use protein powder at all and as always a pinch of salt for the extra kick so while the chocolate is melting we're going to mix up our other ingredients so we're going to mix the peanut butter vanilla extract the protein powder and the stevia to combine the peanut butter mixture if you use peanut butter preferably you should use more running peanut butter and if you use pv2 just add more water because the protein will make it a lot more thick so we're going to divide that in five I'll have the ingredients in the description box below if you want to make like seven just divide those amounts by five and times them by seven I think it's simple math you can probably do it I believe you we're going to lay out you nut butter mixture and the paper cups and then you're going to place the ball to chocolate on top after that you can put it in the fridge or the freezer depending on the texture that you want to get and they come out really yummy and that's basically it that's how you have healthy anabolic low-calorie peanut butter cups and you don't need to cheat on your diet you can just cheat on your girlfriend

hash browns veggie sausage excuse me you like talking to your best friend there the camera you talk to it all the time I'm trying to make a vlog is that a problem anyways that's the crappy record you don't even upload well I'm working on that but every time I go to make a vlog something goes wrong okay and people are asking me to make vlogs for the second channel violet my other channel violets second you're constantly recording well that's what I'm supposed to be doing anyways I was going to make a vlog on violets second about smoothies and everyone everyone a great one care you agreed if I made that huge breakfast that we can have my smoothies and I already bought all the ingredients okay and I was going to make these nice smoothies put a hint of vegetables in them and have us have smoothies but apparently you disagree with that just a little hint of vegetables vegetables William you wouldn't even taste it it's just a tiny bit I'm gonna fusing it back and you put fruit with vegetables now I mean okay that doesn't were alright so if I take out the vegetables well you'll have the smoothie no I still don't want the smoothie but women you agreed to have a smoothie but I want a peanut butter and jelly that's all that's William I already went through this what else do you want to know just make you agreed if I made the big breakfast today as actually it was more like a brunch that we could have smoothies later mom they'll be dinner no peanut butter and jelly for dinner no you know what I haven't Meiji peanut butter and jelly since you were little I haven't been making it for a couple years William we don't even have eat that in this house my dad always has them for late-night snacks oh look you know what you're the one that's constantly calling him a scrub and you're gonna quote the way he eats is an example you know he doesn't eat healthy so if he eats something I can't eat it so like if he eats something they want to know on the play that you need it first of all I'm not talking about the planet I'm talking about us second of all it's not you we we already agreed to have smoothies okay I'm I never agreed that you know what I'm having smoothies okay you can go make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or two or whatever it is you want to make up no I don't know how to you go make them and have a nice glass you don't know how to William you helped make food before it's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you take out two pieces of bread what about let chocolate milk oh no I told you about the chocolate no before skin milk and I suppose you don't want to use my special bread do you no no I'm not using your special bread William so you want to use white bread and have peanut butter and jelly with chocolate milk let me tell you some things I have wrong with that first of all you should have it on whole-grain red not white bread second of all you should have skim milk not chocolate and you know what I'm in the time it took you to say all this you could have had my freaking and another example is oh my gosh don't listen to me when I have my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I don't have jelly on mine that's not even peanut butter and jelly well that's what I mean no I have a piece of whole grain bread and I spread peanut butter across it and that's how I have my sandwiches English well then and then I guess it's a peanut butter - a jelly sandwich no it's a peanut butter sandwich it's not a peanut butter - the jelly sandwich and I just yeah I don't put two pieces of bread together I just eat it by itself anyways William what excuse me oh you know what I need to make these smoothies for the vlog excuse me I make the smoothies no you know what I'll tell you what you want peanut butter and jelly yes I want me to beg you go make it yourself you make it no how come you made it for me when I was younger William you are a little boy like ten years old what's the difference between me and then and now uh you're 15 you're not 10 anymore there's a big difference so you're telling me you you're being ages don't what me you'd make up for defeat of our ages for a ten-year-old but not a fifteen-year-old well if you're a little bit more mature ages cuz you're a little bit more mature than a ten-year-old you need on attacked that doesn't mean you still can't make me a freakin peanut butter jelly in

got my favorite candy reese's peanut butter cup this is a miniature um what why is reese's peanut butter cup my favorite because i like peanut butter a lot and chocolate and peanut butter together is just like you know really awesome probably why i like the commercial growing up when um it shows somebody putting peanut butter in chocolate and how's that how did that commercial go man i can't remember it's like it was like someone took a piece of chocolate and put it in a thing of peanut butter and he took it out and tasted as like like a light bulb went off or something i didn't show something like that but i think that was kind of the the digest of it you know what i mean but anyway milk chocolate peanut butter that's what it says glow-in-the-dark wrapper another one from past halloween um on the entry table at work i just grabbed one one of each of the candy bars it says this is best by 2021 so they stay good for a while well this one doesn't look like it has much of a sign that it's been melted in a vehicle before it got here it looks like it's all right the other two kind of had that kind of look about it but getting the chocolate you can get the although you can't see the peanut butter right now you get it right through the through the top the peanut butter smells good oh yeah this has been melted yeah it's not in real good shape you can tell it's is kind of not coming out very good of the wrapper it's kind of sticking to it but it's okay it's gonna still taste good let's see if it goes coffee oh yeah peanut butter and coffee peanut butter and chocolate and coffee that's why not that i have had one yet but in the beer world they've made you know like peanut butter chocolate stouts or something like that which sounds really really good but

I have to get as many cookies as I can so this month's cookie of the month is an amazing Christmas cookie that I have so many great memories of baking growing up it's a miniature peanut butter cup cookie and it is so delicious it's practically candy in itself and I think it's going to become one of your favorite family memories to make this also to start you just cream some butter with brown sugar and white sugar cream it until it's combined a little bit lighter and fluffier and texture then you just want to add some egg to it some creamy peanut butter and a little bit of vanilla mix that together until it's well combined you may need to scrape down the bowl if you have any bits of butter or anything alongside the bowl or at the bottom in a separate Bowl you want to sit together your dry ingredients it's just some flour some baking soda and add some salt you can slowly add it to your butter mixture as the mixtures running on a low speed make sure to do it at a low speed or otherwise you are going to have flour everywhere and it really will be like a white Christmas in your kitchen not as fun once the dough is completely combined you can start making your balls I love to use a small ice cream or cookie scoop for this and they just need to be about one inch in diameter just make the balls and then roll them slightly in your hand to get them smooth and texture and then place them into a small or miniature muffin tin these are wonderful if you don't have these on hand and there are so many great things to make refuse you just want to place a ball in each one and then slightly press it down with your thumb or forefinger this just gets it started in the shape you're going to want it to be able to place a peanut butter cup treat inside once you have your whole pan ready to go place into a preheated oven and let it bake for about 8 to 10 minutes you want them to become puffed and slightly golden but not overdone on the bottom once you remove them from the oven you want to immediately put a peanut butter cup treat the bite-sized ones of course in the middle of each one and press it down until it's level at the top of the cookie it's best to have all them unwrapped from their foil wrap or however you buy them before you do this since you want to put them in still when the cookies are hot you just make sure to have them ready to go in a bowl then you want to make sure that cookies cool down for at least 10 minutes in the pan don't try to remove them right away because it'll be way too soft and just fall apart and you'll have melted chocolate and peanut butter and cookie all over your counter once they're cooled down for 10 minutes just using either a small paring knife like I sometimes use or any other type of small utensil just make sure the cookies break free from your pan I was using a nonstick pan so I did not grease them but if yours is not nonstick you may want to slightly grease them and put them onto a cooling rack and let them cool at least for another 10 to 20 minutes while they're cooling you can bake the rest your cookies and also you can melt a little bit of milk chocolate this is really just an extra little thing to do especially on the holidays and make them all the more beautiful place the milk chocolate inside of a heat proof Bowl and place in the microwave for about 30 second increments until it's completely melted stirring and in between and then I think it's easier if you just use a little bottle with a little tip on it or you could use a little pastry bag or you could even try to use a spoon and just drizzle the chocolate over them these bottles really do make such a quick and easy way to put this chocolate on there fitted with a little tip and you can just drizzle on the chocolate all over these this really just gives a finishing touch to these cookie bites i drizzle kind of an across hatch pattern and once you're done they are absolutely gorgeous and even more delicious your family is going to absolutely fall in love with these Christmas candy cookies they're one of my favorites and I can't wait for them to become one of yours also thanks for watching this video to watch more Christmas

packets and jars but I haven't seen the nice I was expecting to dump this out and have them be unwrapped but this is a really nice thing where you can just pop one in your in your bag or in your pocket or your backpack and it's it's all wrapped I love that I'm not sure why and now that I'm looking at the package it certainly looks like they're wrapped I'm not sure why I didn't realize that but I didn't so here we go I'm gonna take a bite interestingly they also have an average size and so similar to a Reese's but there's no paper on there so you do unwrap the foil but you don't need to unwrap that paper as well and that's nice it's good it's very good the peanut butter is very sweet the chocolate is is really good it's a different flavor but it's not tremendously different than a Reese's the peanut butter is not quite as sweet and I would say the chocolate is a better consistency than a Reese's it's smoother so I really like it but I'm very partial to races as well but this was really yummy I I really like it and I love the fact that they're miniature and they're individually wrapped in so that you can just take one or two and go and I would say it's got a very strong peanut buttery flavor probably stronger than a Reese's but again the peanut butter is not quite as sweet but delicious and the chocolate is a little bit smoother also delicious so I really like this a lot if you like peanut butter and chocolate I think you would really like this as well so thank you so much for watching if you like what you've seen and you would consider subscribing I would love that and I hope you have a sweet day thank you", "Xj-BqRE09C0": "[Music] i wanted to show you how i make mike's favorite healthy chocolate peanut butter cups he really likes them you start with some coconut oil and you're going to melt that in the microwave so it looks like water add some vanilla extract [Music] and a little bit of maple syrup this is your sweetener i only add a little bit but you want to make sure that it's 100 maple syrup and organic cacao powder this is my favorite good source of magnesium lots of antioxidants i added three heaping spoonfuls of this and then mix it up mix mix until it's no longer lumpy [Music] so keep mixing until you lose all of those lumps and then take mini cupcake liners and just add your a little bit of your chocolate to the bottom of each liner you just need to cover the bottom and then you need to freeze them for about 10 minutes so they get solid like that and then you add peanut butter i'm using just natural peanut butter i don't mix it with anything [Music] again [Music] pretty good for you", "qtBwSLiscp8": "[Music] hey y'all it's christy and on today's episode of bear street eats we're making peanut butter cup ice cream to make the ice cream you'll need 1 cup creamy peanut butter 2 3 cup granulated sugar 1 cup whole milk nicely chilled 2 cups of heavy cream well chilled as well a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract and you'll need reese's peanut butter cups and or pieces i think i'm going to do a a little bit of both today and i use a cuisinart frozen yogurt ice cream sherbet maker and i love it to start we're going to put our cup of creamy peanut butter in with our granulated sugar and this is uh two-thirds a cup and what we're doing here is we're going to mix them together and so grab your mixer and we're going to do this on low speed so that we can just get it incorporated so that it's not going to be gritty or grainy we're going to mix these together until you know that it's nice and smooth [Music] okay now that we've got it nice and smooth and i've scraped the bowl a couple of times and tried to make sure that i've got as much of it incorporated as possible i'm going to add the milk when i put that in i'm going to blend that on low speed as well and we're basically trying to get that as smooth as possible and until the sugar is dissolved which should probably take us about two minutes the last step we'll make before we actually have the ice cream prepared is going to be to add this heavy cream and it's two cups of it again it's supposed to be well chilled and so we're going to put it in and we'll stir this in so i'm going to try to stir as i actually am pouring and again this is going to make it nice and creamy and thick much more ice cream-ish i guess and once we finish that we'll put in the vanilla extract and again we'll keep stirring it and as we do that we're going to be able to get a better sense of how much we have actually made it's supposed to make about 10 half cup servings but if you're anything like us that's just not gonna be how that works out but we stir it it looks almost like one of those really fancy coffee drinks as far as really pretty and lots of different colors in there then i'm gonna put my vanilla in there stir that in really good as well and then we are off to the fun part okay our next step is really where we kind of do the hands off part so we're going to use the mixture that we've made and we're going to put it in our cuisinart ice cream maker and this is such a cool little thing if you don't have one highly recommend there's probably other brands that do something similar but i've had this for years have had nothing but luck we have a deep freeze that i keep the freezer part in so that whenever we get that hankering we can go grab it and we can put together some yummy ice cream so at this point what i need to do i've got that in there i'm going to put our ice cream churn inside put the lid on it goes right into place super easy and i used a bowl that's got that rubber grip on the bottom because i get a little carried away sometimes we make a little more mess we need to this actually grips the counter really well for me but it also has a spout so this makes this a little bit easier for me i am going to actually start the ice cream maker and i'm going to pour the mixture in as i do that all right now's the easy slash hard part wait the question art has to do its work and as it does it we will come back to it after about 25 minutes and we'll put in our candy i've got the minis that are already unwrapped and then some of the pieces i will probably cut up some of the pieces so that they're not quite as hard and i'll probably even cut up the minis maybe half or quarters but then we'll put them in at the end i'll show that to you in a little bit so you kind of get a sense of what the ice cream looks like it's good [Music] all right it's been going for about 25 minutes now i'm going to add in our coarsely chopped peanut butter cups and pieces you can do one or the other um you can do them both together whatever you want to do the recipe itself calls for not quite a cup of it but you can kind of do what you like if you like more crunch if you like more texture go for it it's going to be perfectly fine so i'll put this in and then we'll go for another five minutes and we'll be done [Music] all right we're done it has finished mixing and it is a super creamy texture it's pretty soft but i actually like it this way so i'm going to take a little sample don't tell anybody it's so good if you like peanut butter you're gonna love this but right now i'm gonna put it into an airtight container i'm gonna then put it in the freezer so it can sit and it can stay in there for a couple weeks i it won't you won't you won't have it in there long but this way it'll get a little bit harder a little bit a little bit less on the soft serve side but i hope that you really enjoy this we've made it for some friends tonight so we're looking forward to letting them try it as well but uh if you have it a little bit too hard i wouldn't recommend that you pull it out of the freezer about 10 minutes before you want to serve it let it kind of soften back up for you but you're going to love it i can't wait for you to try it it's good stuff can't wait for you to try it let us know what you think have a great day bye [Music] you", "k8xohVvH0PI": "[Music] [Music] so welcome back to another video today we have reese's and we have the new ultimate peanut butter lovers recess so reese's actually just released um what dropped the news on march 1st that is i guess national peanut butter lovers day so that is when they released this new product um no let me scratch that they released the news not the product the product is supposed to release on early april but i don't know what in the world happened um but i actually found it online so i don't know if it was like an accident or it was meant to be released online and we got ourselves a whole box um we didn't want to wait around until april so we just got the box and it got delivered today so today is the third it was shipped really quick um i don't know what happened during this like trip the shipment because it got like busted open um but it is all here we took one out but we haven't tried it we have not tried as you can tell there is one missing right here which is that one so we have not tried it there's it's a 24 pack so the difference with this one the ultimate peanut butter lovers and the regular peanut butter lovers is that the this one is all peanut butter coating so the other one had just like a thin top layer of peanut butter and then the bottom part of the cup was still chocolate so this one doesn't have any chocolate it's just the filling is peanut butter and the coating is peanut butter so a little closer look at all that peanut butter i'm so excited i'm excited because the other ones are really good the peanut butter ones are really good but like i said they still have chocolate so this one i just imagined to be so yummy i'm going to open it up yeah oh i'm so excited wait do we each get two what do you mean this is open one off or not what do we hate it all right you can look at it as well duh well it looks the same as the other one from the top all from the top layer right here right so this is what it looks like there you go so the same as the other one so now i'm gonna unwrap it though oh my gosh it's not big peanut butter look at this yep why no way cheers this is all good i'm in heaven it's really really good five out of five five out of five for me as well wow it tastes like a spoon full of peanut butter pretty much yeah but with that little like not crunch but i would just say that it's like a hard uh well because of the hard coating yeah it's like you put peanut butter in the freezer like the smokers peanut butter how this is frozen peanut butter yeah pretty much i love frozen peanut butter no wonder yeah that's exactly what because it's kind of hard but then we chew down it gets like soft it's so good yes i definitely recommend these i think they're gonna be um like limited time only once they finally release so definitely get your hands on them once they're out it is worth it should we hold on to these and like maybe sell them five dollars of um okay so there's one thing i haven't even told him but i had it in mind when i found out about these i actually found out on instagram with the recess um the reese's official recess instagram posted it and down below in the comments people were suggesting them to make a pb and j recess so i thought what if we just use one of these and spread some jelly on it oh i'm gonna try it yeah i wanna try it i wanna try it so we're gonna try it with some jelly on it just a little bit obviously we're not gonna put a whole bunch but just to see like would that be a good idea maybe in the future have like a jelly filled with peanut butter coating around or or reese's can put like a little packet of jelly inside like just so we can squirt it on it on there i mean yeah let's see if it's good all right let's see let's try it out all right so we're gonna go get the jelly and then we'll be back yeah we'll be right back a few moments later all right so we don't want to bore you with like spreading the jelly or anything um we got strawberry jelly and then we put some grape jelly i don't know if you can see i don't want to tell too much but we typically like grape jelly we don't really do strawberry jelly but we're gonna try it for the video um so let's see let's try strawberry okay all right just just because you know grape is better i don't know about those comments down below [Laughter] i mean it doesn't wait it does smell like a ppj sandwich of course i'm sure all right here we go pretty much peanut butter and jelly all you need is a bread should we get bread yeah it tastes like a sandwich what it really does right yeah i mean like i said we don't really like strawberry like that but it's good it's good with it i like that mm-hmm it was like a good amount too okay let's see i think this one's gonna be really good that great thing i'm really excited for that one if the strawberry one tasted good then yeah cheers reese's should definitely get on it it's good it's really good you know what reese's should buy smokers reese should buy or merge or work with smuckers to make their own sandwiches wow or just like uh the filling or yeah they should fill it or what they can do right put a little package oh a lego smoker package a smoker package in there i don't know i don't know i'm jelly in each of these i never pictured myself eating like jelly on a reese's even the other peanut butter lovers because they still had chocolate but this one definitely works with jelly wow yeah kind of weird i recommend it go ahead and try to buy the box and just try it out yeah so keep an eye out because like i said it's not supposed to release until early april but it's march 3rd so i'm sure if this was out already it's probably because it's coming out sooner than they announced um so just keep an eye out yeah could happen well there you have it please subscribe and smash that like button and we'll see you guys next time [Music] you [Music]", "I0jQ-AHaXKM": "today but we're making Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cookies this is more of a technique or a demonstration than a recipe but anyway this is how you do it I have peanut butter cookie dough here you can use any of your favorite peanut butter cookie dough recipes that you have this is actually half of the peanut butter blossom recipe that I made earlier and all you're gonna do is take about again tablespoon size of dough I'm gonna roll this in your hands and coat this in sugar and put it into a mini muffin tin this is a 24 muffin tin I got it at Walmart for $10 so they're really not expensive just put it in the muffin tin like that press your finger in the center and then you take a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup mini just like that set it in the middle press it down so the sides come up and look like that and you just do this until your pay in this bowl or until you run out of cookie dough and then you bake them at 350 degrees for about eight to ten minutes all right so these just came out of the oven that were in there for about nine minutes or so now I forgot to tell you that you can also use and if you don't want to make peanut butter cookie dough you can go and buy and use the pre-made cookie dough from the grocery store that's perfectly fine for these but yeah just let these cool a little while in the muffin tin this is half of a recipe and I got that eighteen cookies out of that so this makes quite a few and there you go hope you enjoy peanut butter cup cookies you", "42ZdL9dQ-Zo": "foreign so [Music] [Music] [Music] so okay it's like it's a lot is hi this is i'm and in the fridge to go meanwhile over here it's just gonna take a while so that was six o'clock yep all right so over here oh my god yeah just spread it to the edges [Music] so oh my god that looks good we're gonna eat all these oh my god that right there is a reese's peanut butter cup it's not as sugary as the store-bought ones nice smooth oh good so recipe cup of peanut butter a quarter cup of butter divide it up in tiny pieces and two cups of icing sugar and we mix it in a mixer and then we molded them into three sections and rolled them out put them in the fridge and while that was chilling we made uh two separate bowls of uh chocolate chips it's like quarter cup of shortening yeah so each one was 12 ounces and two tablespoons okay so in two different so what we did was uh 12 ounces of chocolate chips and two tablespoons of shortening in one bowl and then we did another bowl 12 ounce chips and two tablespoons of shortening with the melt of them you see now we melted them down made a nice smooth batter or chocolate and then when we were getting i scooped out the chocolate for the bottoms and then gina laid in the peanut butter pieces that we sliced up and then put chocolate on the top and about here i ran out of chocolate so what i did i actually made up a third bowl it's about 10 ounces of chocolate chips i guess i just took a guess and put in another two tablespoons of shortening melted that and then we finished still didn't quite have enough but but if these this doesn't here were in larger muffin cups so if they were in the same size as these they would probably look the same but it doesn't matter they're going to taste the same that's what matters the most there you have it reese's pieces peanut butter cups made at home", "IzuQ1WQE7OU": "this is part two because my time was up so now we're gonna have to have many parts just because yeah but it's mixing smoothly as i want it to be so yeah um but now we take now we take our cupcake liners i'm going to probably do like 10 or so maybe if i can but yeah i'm uh so you're gonna put one lighter at the bottom then you're gonna take your peanut butter and your smashed graham crackers that are mixed together in the middle and then a layer on top of chocolate i'll show you the final piece so yeah oh yeah for the first layer of chocolate put it in the freezer before you peanut butter then it will be all messy okay so i finished uh putting all the first layer of chocolate in the freezer so now i gotta put on the peanut butter graham crackers so yeah but um okay so now we're gonna make twix so i'm gonna have shortbread instead of graham crackers by graham crackers but um i got shortbread at the king super some so all you need is shortbread chocolate caramel so take your first shortbread and then i already have like chocolate from left over from like melted chocolate from leftover from luis but i'm gonna dip it sir supposed to get so much better okay so i'm gonna just like make this better so okay so i put the shortbread with the chocolate on it in the freezer to dry so but like this is finished so sir there you go", "EFs4FbbsKsY": "[Music] these chocolate paper these chocolate bitter cook while visa pleated hello everybody and welcome back to my channel since last week's carrot cake video was a little bit more labor-intensive I thought that this week's recipe should be really quick and easy meaning it'll take no more than 15 minutes to prepare and be ready to eat so using just five simple ingredients that I'm going to put in the description down below so you guys can follow along with me we are gonna be making some delicious and healthy chocolate peanut butter cups alright let's get started so the first step in making this recipe is to mix up our chocolate base so for this all we're going to need is some creamy unsalted peanut butter vanilla extract maple syrup coconut oil and some cocoa powder now we're just going to mix up [Music] while these science is cool all right I've just finished mixing the chocolate base and here I have a mini cupcake tin that I just lined with some cupcake liner so we can take our peanut butter cups out quickly now I'm just going to start scooping in any thin layer of our chocolate into each of the cupcake tins [Music] now that I've scooped the chocolate base into each of the cupcake tins and smooth it out to create a flatter surface I'm going to put it in the freezer to set while I start working on the peanut butter base to make our peanut butter base I've just grabbed another small glass bowl and put in the same amount of peanut butter coconut oil maple syrup and vanilla extract as we did for our chocolate base this time I just omitted the cocoa powder now [Music] now that our peanut butter base has been fully combined you can just take our cupcake tins back from the freezer and start scooping in our peanut butter on top now that our peanut butter is on top of our chocolate it's ready to go into the freezer to set so because we're using coconut oil it's going to set relatively quickly so you could enjoy these treats very soon after you make them all right and here is our finished results these chocolate peanut butter cups are an amazing and delicious alternative for the classic Reese's Cup they're also full of healthy fats which is why they should be stored in the freezer to make sure that they don't melt now if you enjoyed this video

[Music]", "unTv8w5UTHQ": "hi I'm Tariq Elam from living out and I'm calm this is my son David and today we're going to be making the best gift you can make for a teenage boy every time I've made this for a teenage boy they have absolutely loved it it's a giant peanut butter cup the recipe comes from our living on a dime cookbook page 266 so if you have a cookbook you can find it in here real easy it's known as peanut butter cups or peanut butter balls and we're just going to make it into one great big peanut butter cup instead of little ones today exactly yay okay so this is just a sixth ingredient recipe it's really simple and it doesn't even take but 5-10 minutes to put together so I started off by putting in two cups of powdered sugar confectioner sugar depending on which part of the country you live in and then we're going to put in one cup of peanut butter whoa that's really thick it's like and I did not get a fire sure measuring cup I use the same measuring cup for my powdered sugar and my peanut butter that's good I please spoon in there and then it's 1 teaspoon of vanilla but of course I'm just guessing these caps are approximately a half a teaspoon so I just do two caps and pour it in there and a half a cup of butter or margarine and we'll throw all this together in here and Dave oh whoops and David is going to mix it together and as you will see we only have one Peter my mixer Brooke but we happen to be in the middle of a blizzard right now and I'm not about to go down to the store to get a new mixer and at living on a dime we keep saying make do with what you have so that's what we're going to do so hopefully we can get this mess alright go for it so don't just do yep relay nope okay well just shake off the mixer okay now okay I do this all the time but if you're doing those kids don't do that I just put my meat beat mixer in and just hold it just above the goop and turn it on and it flings off everything and then I don't have to pound and pound together but make sure the adults doing that okay now you can see it's all pretty mixed together just a couple of little pieces are left now that's the filling I just buy this handy coating of the store that comes in the little things and now they even make it so it's in a microwaveable trade and I already pre microwaved it and this is like so cool I didn't know that they did this until this year so I've been spending all this time microwaving it but if you don't have the little trays or you want to use chocolate chips or something instead which you this is the candy coating but you can use chocolate chips just as easy and what I do is I melted in a double boiler and all of the boiler is is boiling water in a pan with a metal bowl and you just start letting it melt and you can see mine's melting here down low but and of course we won't use big oft about chocolate but um then you just let it sit over your water until it melts just keep stirring it and then you can use it that way that's what a double boiler is it's not anything fancy or impressive that's all it is it's just a metal bowl on top of a regular pan with boiling water okay so now to make your great big peanut butter cup this is just a regular pie tin it works best if you have the kind that has the big just because a holster I line it with some foil just like this okay babe I trust an assistant here okay so we're going to just line the inside face with a little bit of chocolate so just put a few spoonfuls but okay it's going to need more than a few spoonfuls let's do this there you go okay so we're probably about oh I don't know a third of the chocolate in there okay what the edge is so it's not dripping all over the place perfect good okay now he's spreading it around a bit out of the way spread spread and you can't just kind of go like this and we have to do it really slowly or else it'll like not do anything make a big mess P dump it all over the counter yeah and then we're going to pull it up on the edges like this tada be careful and just get it all around the edges like that and then you don't want your chocolate you want your chocolate slightly cooled because it makes it easier to spread it um sorry we're all sick around here as usual so that's what it looks like we're going to take a three minute break and pop this in the freezer look at the Majestic coating in its natural habitat it's freezing okay so it's really outside because our freezers full and we didn't have any groups up we have it outside because it's about you know exchanger grace yeah sixteen degrees and it's snowing and like six degrees so it'll get cold fast and get set up really quick like three minutes four minutes hey we're back from outside in the cold and it's all frozen okay it's not really frozen it's just set up it took about three minutes you think dave probably froze measurements okay so now Dave is going to spread the feeling inside go ahead dick please pop it in there go for it but isn't it cooling right yeah sure from there big ol blopps like huge people blocks that that just like those little tiny ones see I'm just mixing around getting it all down I'm trying to get stuff out okay so now we got this all in here okay that's good and we smoothed it all around and you want to make sure that there's more chocolate above the peanut butter so that you have room to add your chocolate then we're going to take the rest of the chocolate yay and let's see here I'll pour you spread okay okay so pour it in the rest of the chocolate Wow can you say delicious and just so you know for cost the chocolate cost me two dollars and 49 cents not that much not that much and the rest of the grates were approximately $1 give or take maybe less maybe 50 75 cents um I haven't broken it all down recently but it's around between 50 cents on the dollar that's really cheap then you just spread your chocolate all over to get your peanut butter covered now it gets kind of hard when you get towards the end because you got to work quick because the rest of it is cool you don't want to your chocolate to set up too quick so make it all fancy by here sort of just smooth it down okay now we're going to go let this sit in the refrigerator for approximately 1 to 2 minutes while it gets frozen or in our case we're going to set it outside because our freezers full what we're back yay okay so put this in the freezer it's all frozen up I did in between touch up the chocolate in a couple of spots that we realized we didn't get covered so here's the magic moment we hope you pull off foil and you have a humongous peanut butter cup yeah so how I freeze like this is I don't serious I take and do two large pieces of foil then I put it on the middle and I wrap it over the top then I tuck in the sides get this oil out of the way okay cut that side eh yep bring it down and squeeze again it's please sit down sweetie and you have a great big peanut butter cup I'm telling you every teenage boy I've ever given an assist to has absolutely loved it right day yes that's right so we're gonna put a great big bow on this and we're going to give it to some lucky cousin for Christmas or maybe one of my three sons or two daughters who knows and we will see lots of happy faces for big boys a movie they can't see something you need to like print off a big Reese's Pieces butter cup thing and the top well yeah that would work too so this recipe is in dining on a dime good book page 266 takes you about five minutes to make ten minutes with the wrapping if you do it really fancy like dave was suggesting and that's your three dollar Christmas gift for any teenage boy you okay so this recipes on page 266 on teaching the readers isn't asking for a sneak peek yeah so there you go all right let's sneak peek and they should have sneaky I know but head low we're trying to sell cover up your cigar time pasta too that's a little longer peek okay that's probably enough for now you got a

favorite little treats which would be little chocolate peanut butter and jelly cups they're kind of like a vegan version of resis but not really because there's jelly in them and there are a lot of healthier for you than a Reese's but they are very good they don't taste like they're healthy and they're not some of the ingredients are a lot better for you than what you would find in a candy at the store they're relatively easy to make but they are a little bit time-consuming and tedious to make because you literally just have to fill all the chocolate cups I mean you'll see but they are totally worth it like every time I make these I'm so irritated because I just want it to be over and then I eat them and I'm like it was all worth it so if you guys want to see how to make these little peanut butter cups then just keep watching ok so the first thing that we want to do is melt the chocolate and get our cups coated and the like base layer so I'm just gonna be using a microwave safe dish this is obviously just a measuring cup the best way to do this is over a double boiler but if you guys haven't been able to tell by now I really don't like doing more dishes than I have to so I microwaved my chocolate I'm using these Guittard semi-sweet chocolate baking chips these are vegan there's no like milk or anything in them use whatever chocolate you want I'm gonna kind of make like a milk chocolate and then I have these King David baking white chocolate flavored coins I got these on a in a three pack for like $15 on Amazon and they're really good they're a little little little bit I don't want to say waxy I don't really know how to explain it there's like some kind of oil in them or something like that but melted in you can't tell it's just like eating these plain I mean it's not supposed to be white chocolate they're like vanilla baking chips pretty much I put some of these in there too just to make this more of like a milk chocolate because I don't know I just never really liked dark or a bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate like it's just too sour and bitter for me I just like milk chocolate and I can't really find like vegan milk chocolate I don't know if I've had it other than like the rice milk bars but my cat's just joining us don't mind him okay I'm gonna just microwave this in 30-second intervals on 50% and stir it up in between okay so not everything is completely melted in here but I'm pretty sure this is hot enough that if I just stir it it's going to melt the remaining chocolate so I'm just going to do that until it's nice and smooth okay so I've started enough that it's completely smooth now I was gonna like kind of half-ass attempt to temper the chocolate with the method I forget what it's called but it's where you melt all the chocolate and then you just keep adding pieces of like regular just chocolate chips to it to cool it down but I don't even have like a proper thermometer to test the temp and I don't trust my like visual instinct on when it's actually at the right ten okay so I pre lined a mini cupcake tin with some mini cupcake liners some of them are different colors because they're from two different boxes but I lined them like this so I can just keep them in the wrapper and what I'm going to do is just place a very thin coating of the chocolate around the outside like I'm going to pour some in the center and then kind of wipe it up the sides and then once I've done to the whole tray I'm going to refrigerate it for a few minutes just to let it set because I'm not tempering my chocolate [Music] okay so now that I have aligned all of them with chocolate the worst parts over this is like the most tedious part I'm going to refrigerate them just to let the chocolate set some of these cups turned out very ugly shaped I dropped this tray right after I finished lining it I just totally knocked it off the counter and crushed a bunch of these but these are the last of my paper cups so I don't have any nice ones so sorry about that alright guys I upgraded to a ninja blender I got one on like in a Black Friday sale off Amazon so I'm going to just take one of the smallest nutri ninja cups and hit some dates and throw them in there and blend it up with a little bit of water to make a paste but like I don't know five or six dates I'm going to just add some like pretty warm water to this and some maple syrup and then blend it up until it's really smooth so I probably put like three tablespoons of maple syrup and maybe a quarter cup of water [Music] that's what I'm talking about it looks like caramel I mean there's still a couple little pieces but it's good enough so I put it the date mixture into a bowl I may end up there's like a whole date in there oh my gosh never mind there's like a whole date in there got abundant again actually I'm just gonna eat that one going to add like a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract like a teaspoon and a half maybe okay I'm going to use some powdered peanut butter I don't actually use pb2 anymore I bought I think the brand is called true night I just used this container because I bought like a huge container of it but it's like organic and I don't think there's sugar or there might be coconut sugar in it I don't know but it's better for you than this I think so I'm just gonna put I'm probably gonna put some real peanut butter too but I'm going to put like maybe half a cup in here actually I like this is like a cup I'm actually gonna add some almond butter because I've never made these with almond butter and I really want to try it and it's the crunchy kind just use regular peanut butter if you want you don't even have to use PB two if you don't care just use regular peanut butter use any nut butter that you want so I'll add probably about a half cup of this okay so I've mixed all that up so far I tasted it it definitely needs some salt because there's no salt in that almond butter and there's like minimal salt in this pv2 stuff or true nut whatever the heck the brand is so I'm adding about a half teaspoon of salt and I also need to add some more of the powdered peanut butter because there's just not enough about 3/4 cups again so these have had plenty of time to set up a little bit so the consistency of the peanut butter this is like perfect it if you use just regular peanut butter and powdered sugar you'll get an even easier consistency but the dates make this a little bit sticky but it's almost like a dough at this point like I'm basically just gonna roll up little balls and kind of just press them in here a little tip is if you do it like this the dough does get sticky so I just kind of dropped the little balls in there and then you just get a little bit of water on your finger and you can press it down and it won't stick to your finger so now I'm going to fill these with my current favorite jelly you can use any jelly or jam or marmalade whenever this is from the crofters brand it's organic berry harvest I love this so I just melted up some more chocolate just to make sure I had enough and I'm just going to pour it over the tops of these and then put them back in the fridge to set and then I'll let you know how they come out [Music] all right so once again I'm going to stick these in the fridge and let them set one final time this is how they end up coming out I just refrigerated them for I don't know like ten minutes or so well I mean I've made these I can't even tell you how many times I love making these you can take the jelly out if you're not into that you can use regular peanut butter like I've already said whatever chocolate you want it's heavenly I love these I hope you guys enjoy this recipe I hope you guys make them and let me know if you do and if you end up liking them and if you guys know vegan milk chocolates let me know so I don't always have to like make stuff up that is going to finish up this video I really hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for subscribing if you have and I'll see you in my next video alright bye", "j1xyUExc-kQ": "but i just did it you want me to do it again yeah do it again after you press that record this one yeah oh no

directing girls are doing some sort of project to finish up school project at the end of the day well welcome we are here today i'm gonna make another action-packed cocktail for the world now and not just the cwk world i know the entire world those of you that know us those of you that don't it makes me nervous you're here with us now you're in our home i don't care at all right now i'm comfortable because i'm with people i know and i'm pretending i'm speaking to those people even though i'm talking to johnny he's like your daily affirmative johnny wilkinson from ohio and who's johnny wilkins pablo escobar i'm talking about all these characters around the world but welcome to all of you we've had a humdinger of a week we made the pearl harbor on monday we did we made a redo of the negroni with campari versus aperol which was a nice tasty cocktail very fantastic now today we're going to make a new cocktail yep new one today we got kristen over here making cocktails again but before we move forward the question i have for the world and me and those of you that are capable of answering and those of you that are on the youtube can still answer after the fact on the comments section yeah everybody can comment comment down below like rate so the director the director and kristen right now are two huge huge fans of shit's creek oh yes accurate but i love it what is over 10 years ago what is like your favorite tv series from over 10 years ago friends i mean i mean just so like it's one of those you scroll through the you know of everything on tv right now and you're just like oh friends is playing might as well watch that since i've seen this episode 100 times don't care 27 i would like to watch seinfeld all the time i love seinfeld right it sounds good i always like seinfeld i feel like a lot of people that did seinfeld didn't do front like it was in either or i did both i like seinfeld more but i still appreciate the friends aspect but the sign fell for now it's oc yeah yeah but they're trying to like compile 10 years worth into one and it's a show about nothing really so that's the thing is this a can i say gray's anatomy because it's still going on even though it was still it was happening 10 years ago that's right er oh er was good so that's your favorite that was like the start of like the whole medical drama thing because i love house too actually was that the start of medical drawings was math yes that was a little different that was popular once the most popular show three years was great too the one he is a great one but i really like gilligan's island okay it was not airing when i was it's a great time i expected one of you to maybe say saved by the belt oh say but i wish saved the bell was still honest grace that's a good one too willing yeah but it's not as good as all love's rest but it's it's still a good one though but one and a half minutes now then the charlie sheen is crazy what about something more recently in the last five years again grey's anatomy still applies you still want grey's anatomy my answer in the last f and it's actually more than five hopefully you could have put game of thrones on that what about breaking bad yeah no because game of thrones ended terribly and i'm still mad about it you could do like madman this is us mad men that's a great show that's was that more than five years ago right yeah yeah i'll say last 10 years um that way i don't even know that way i guess that way i could say breaking bad breaking bad scientific old breaking bad news even though it's still not right everyone says the wire but we still have not seen it but we started to watch it and we we should we unfortunately we're still trying to read we need to watch dexter and we need to watch the wires we tried the race we've never watched dexter never christina i watched like half of the first season that's a great one horrible ending as well the most awkward thing that 70s show is that we're actually doing a cocktail right now this is a cocktail show we're supposed to make it it's not a it's a tv show today it's a readings of tv shows this gets brings my next point this is probably why we have 263 members of cwk right now yeah and we have less than 50 subscribers wtf people what is going on i mean do you love me or not they just haven't gotten around to it and they've gotten around to it sweet understanding i never watched that which i probably should have because my whole family grew up in in a funeral home yeah like generation above me and beyond now i feel like i'm not going to comment on the person themselves they can do that if they want to but just a reminder this is a kids family program please don't make comments on the site that are derogatory even in a joking way because facebook will oh yeah put you on probation someone got on prep someone on that on our team in our world who was just joking around was put on probation and that character knows who they are but i'm just basically saying even if you're joking around because people's children and stuff are reading these things and they're going to be like oh my god also facebook but facebook reads it all anyway facebook is a member of us and they love us so if so facto try to keep it clean um so we're here today we're gonna if you can see some of the ingredients that are uh on the table here we're gonna have a fun cocktail we're gonna do something different tis the season jay says he's the one yeah so j just gave up the fact that he's the bad guy i told him if he stops being a d-bag for a second facebook will be fine with him so why don't you tell the world what kind of a fun we're gonna have today for cocktail nice friday afternoon sweet treat we're making a peanut butter cup martini tell everybody a fancy tell everybody about our peanut butter cup martini our peanut butter cup martini has oh i forgot to put it on there because we didn't agree no no numbers that's all right i know i know the types of ingredients i don't know the actual ingredients we're going to number i told you today today's a show i thought it was going to be a great time it was a great day i was frazzled by the girls running around all over the background and then you guys are doing things and good crazy so it's everyone's fault yeah so it's together with those two some things two ounces i would assume two two ounces cups of peanut butter with a ski i gotta speak normally now you know what two ounces of peanut butter whiskey three quarters ounce of chocolate liqueur a half ounce of cream and you garnish with a peanut butter cup but when i tried to do the garnish of peanut butter cups they split into half and pieces and stuff so i ate them and now we just have a sprinkle of chocolate flash's gonna put some shavings on there so either way you could put the shavings on there obviously the peanut butter cup would be a little bit more fitting but i think that because this is gonna be such a sweet treat it's gonna be delightful anyway tell us a little bit about this recipe for the peanut butter cup i sure will this peanut butter cup martini recipe was listed on total wine online's cocktail corner on december 2nd 2020. oh that's that's last week literally last week the cocktail is sure to be a hit for dessert before dinner before bed for breakfast basically any time oh anything goes here so this is why some of the characters know i was on the way to the oakdale liquors last night which is not agreed to sponsor us yet but they will they will um spend a couple hundred dollars and i got some of these unique ingredients that we don't always have around here because i'm not gonna so we're gonna make this peanut butter cup there are hundreds of yeah we don't even shake around here it's literally it's like that's our first show the first day there are hundreds of recipes for peanut butter peanut butter cup martini hold please we're doing great is there even ice in here no yes there's something okay all right so there are hundreds of recipes for peanut butter cup martini we're using this one here today so sometimes they have vodka in the recipe sometimes you have uh peanut butter cream ill cream things like that we're using sugar ball peanut butter whiskey which a lot of people are familiar from the last couple years and people who uh a little bit on the sweeter side are like oh i drink whiskey now because of the peanut butter one which is fine so they're gonna do this it's about 35 percent drizzle with one little chocolate i'm gonna do that at the end so it's not too drippy that's the whole point it's fine yeah but only a little bit like a mudslide we're gonna drizzle chocolate inside it but i don't want it to be too drippy yeah so today and also i was going to make this i was going to make this this drink last week but i was unable to get the godiva chocolate liqueur and then i finally got it yesterday when i went to the stove now this screwball yeah is that it's epic glugging by the way well i was looking it up and uh so it's this husband and wife team from ocean beach california he is a former bartender and he basically just says he grew up in cambodia moved here cambodia yeah and and lived in the states for like 25 years met this girl who who was living in um ocean beach california born and raised there they are stephen and brittany yang um and now he was a bartender and someone asked him to make like this kind of a cocktail so he made the cocktail and he's like why don't i just try to infuse all that kind of stuff and put it into a whiskey itself so they made that all the characters that used to work at the bar they called all those people the misfits screwballs so then they called this and named this drink the scripture the screw bit yeah i mean it's whiskey oh that is delicious good i have a chocolate cart we'll be using this for other things coming around the holidays so you're ready tis amazing a little bit of cream i should make my stomach feel great [Music] i was expecting that i actually expected like your brother to chime in and be like that's diabetes that's exactly what this is i'm gonna get a sugar which is why i'm gonna crash if you notice in in cwk we never made any of these style drinks like the first hundred and fifties it's just now everything we're trying to really be well-rounded that we do everything on the show and it's not just all those whiskies and gins and vodkas so we make pretty much anything any time any place so if someone's interested in some fun cocktails we're gonna do it now look at the way she's gonna do a drizzle here you basically go around the edges and you just let it fly nice soft drizzle on there fancy we're gonna do one the baby cup for amy yeah i would like my initials drizzle okay i'm gonna try and write amy on it oh it's like just put an a i don't know what okay i see my name kind of it wasn't there it was there totally now what's interesting is also if you go on youtube for all of you that refuse to subscribe to us and you just search search for uh not better cocktails with keith yeah there's so many ridiculous things out there for cocktails with keith there was a couple that started on st patrick's day that their name their show was cocktails with the keats because their last name was keith and they made a couple of same practices cocktails did not measure right i don't know i don't think you put enough screwball enough you definitely put it in six ounces i put in five but that's not the measurement it's fine it's fine we try basically the cocktail science is usually something you want to follow because you can't usually just put in two ounces five ounces seven and have it just turn out i mean it wasn't that so she just put whatever she wants in here no i thank you for my sip of i'll make it out of all my entertaining let's see how this is it still looks nice and fun let's give it a whiff it smells like chocolate it does smell chocolatey it smells creamy and delicious you know if we wanted to go if you want to go the route of total total booze on this you could just throw in some baileys it kind of already tastes like bailey's some whipped cream on top it's a great idea it's not too peanut buttery i want it to be more peanut buttery is that a thing you definitely taste a lot of the chocolate yeah and what's it i mean i probably because you didn't put enough of the stuff in no i did the right parts i know so there i think it's delicious it tastes great it tastes like a mudslide yeah it tastes like it tastes like a mud slide in a cup which is weird i want it to be more peanut butter because it has whiskey i actually thought it was going to be super peanut buttery up maybe because of the peanut butter sauce next time instead of chocolate mm-hmm you know yeah you know the peanut like it comes in the same chocolate sauce bottle but you it's like basically just liquidy peanut butter just put on like now this is like in the last couple weeks one of the this is the second time we made one of these weird kind of cocktails like a fruit it's like a sweet treat what was the last week this is way better than the pumpkin pie matinee yeah absolutely that didn't taste pumpkin tastes peanut now what was fun about the which is funny because the pumpkin one tasted like vanilla and this one tastes like chocolate neither actually tastes like what it's supposed to well this is a chocolate is supposed to be part of this a peanut butter cup has chocolate with it so it's there you make a point mensage yeah um put in more screwball is the suggestion no i think we don't have to pour it in right now yeah just put it a little bit right like we're just we're 30 seconds we're gonna adjust horse correct oh that's nope neat that's too many just you do your own you're the best there you go now look at that string thank you it's good that's good it's not small like peanut butter oh that was too much you could take some more now taste that it tastes really nice no i can taste it because i put it in there yeah but i put on more mine's better um but again this is where we have a recipe but we can adjust it and so just as a reminder and taking a step back wednesday was a very big day for cwk we officially kicked off the youtube but it was actually the first time that i've been um hired to be a virtual mixologist so i did that on wednesday night and what i kind of reiterated to those people there is that basically we were making a cocktail which we will make on the show so i'm not going to tell you about right now but they didn't have one of the ingredients they didn't have grenadine for example and they ended up wanting to use they had they used cranberry juice instead right you try it you build off of that and maybe you need to do more or less of other ingredients to make it right i mean if you think that this is like right in your wheelhouse and it's going to be a cocktail you want then mess with this and find it the way you want maybe you put in more peanut butter whiskey and a little bit of and you put in the bailey's and whatever you want if you want it to really knock you knock you over and you put a lot of booze on that do like three ounces of peanut butter whiskey maybe three quarters of the chocolate liquor and maybe a half ounce of baileys and stuff right so most of the times when we're having like whiskey not like a sweet whiskey like this it's anywhere between 40 and 50 right this is 35. this is closer to being like a rum or a vodka like in terms of percentages so don't be afraid to put 33 in there i mean i'm not afraid i mean we're professional booze bags but i think this room now that i put a little bit more in there i really like it yeah it does actually now have more of a peanut butter like aftertaste yeah this is nice you would get if you went out to dinner though you take this instead of your dessert yeah this would be a dessert you have this as your dessert and you'd be like this is great i really like this have it as much dinner what's that smell like this peanut butter so they have a screwball and there's also the there's a few different styles but the two most prevalent ones right now are screwball and scatter brain scatter brain both neither one is spelled properly but the scatter brain has a weird emblem to it but it's a little bit cheaper than screwball's not spelled correctly okay oh so the screw uh range is between 25 and 30 dollars and the scatter brain is between 18 and 25. but i bet you they do the exact same job i couldn't find the scatter brain yesterday this recipe on total wine had scatter brain you need to go in total wine right so that's what we're going to do but we did speaking of which i did spend x amount of dollars yesterday at the liquor store and we bought a bunch of things that were treats to get us through so we got we got the chocolate we got the peanut butter we got some banana um banana liqueur from the banana cabbage banana amy doesn't like bananas well we're gonna give it to her in a cocktail she'll drink it i'll drink it in a cocktail i mean okay disappointing name the thing she wants kelly name the cocktail she want sister my sister hi sister my sister yeah i don't have a sister look at this now this is a treat kelly that you would actually drink actually yeah this is a peanut butter martini peanut butter cup martini kelly i mean because go get one basically you give her a couple you give her anything you give her like one glass of sangria and she's sideways what was that when she came over and i gave her like a whole jug of strawberry margaritas that was fun that was a fun day but now that we now that we enhanced the peanut butter whiskey on this i want to give it a higher grade oh yeah we have to rate these yeah with the adjustment 7.8 that's too much for you kelly's laughing um do a 7.2 though that's a that's a good score if you're over seven you should be drinking this it's a sweet treat now let's let's hear from the director um i wanted to refresh my memory on what i read in the pumpkin martini but i would probably i'll tell you right now that would be great thank you [Laughter] thank you you did a 7.5 you know what i was going to do 7.5 this time but i like this better so i'm going to go 7.6 i was expecting you to say the same as me but i like it a lot better about point one better it's nonsense nonsense now again also just for those so as we mentioned we went through the whole peanut butter thing there's different styles of peanut butter out there that you can get there's also different styles of chocolate liqueur so if you can't find the godiva don't worry about it again the recipe online did not have caniva it had like what is it called bogata chocolate liqueur sure many different styles of chocolate curves out there this one is more of a name brand so it's a little bit more expensive but at cwk we care nothing about money and we just spend it [Music] also today as a reminder to everyone today is the three months since we ran the cwk5k but as we mentioned we are on the 12th today's the 12th today's the 11th i've told you this twice already well whatever i thought it was the 12th wait we're going on tomorrow so it's fine yeah it's this weekend anyway three months this weekend but as we're we're i'm gonna call us partners uh we're partners with soul sisters running club that's who acquired my services the other day this weekend is their 5k so it made my fat lazy ass go out and run today not that i wanted to but that was a good thing it made me do something my plan is to run tomorrow morning i don't know after all these you've had one you'll be fine i don't have more act like you've been here before well i mean it's assumed that this isn't going to be my only one assumed now we'll listen to the spinners do you like the spinners like the song working my way back to you babe it's all right anybody got anything fun for us online no kelly's laughing because we were making fun of her being drunk you know i remember the day she went shoe shopping on the way home and she was going up and down the isles looking for shoes for the kids and she smelled like boobs and she couldn't remember why she was even doing that [Laughter] well anyway this is a good drink you try this drink at home get your peanut butter whiskey mix it around try some stuff i think i think also the peanut butter whiskey would also go nicely in egg dog so i think you can put it in the egg nog it's going to be super sweet then but again some people want that tastes good it's not for everyone it's definitely not for people that are allergic to peanuts as it just says contains peanuts it has peanuts i assume the people that are eligible to drink are also wise enough to know stay away from the peanut butter well i mean it might just have peanut butter flavoring not actual peanuts i would stay away from it anyway yeah um stay away yeah if so fact though for all our youtube friends like subscribe comment below and thank you guys for watching stay safe and drink up bye", "ywXwDZxserQ": "hi

fun time and i got my hair all tied up and i just dropped something so hang on a minute i'm gonna make sure i got all my supplies up here anyhow i got my hair tied up because i don't like to have my hair flying around while i'm cooking anyhow tonight is gonna be our first session of candy making and tonight we're gonna make peanut butter cups one of my favorites y'all know i always cooking my favorites well anyhow this is a really good recipe to make homemade reese's peanut butter cups so please share and like and comment on and everything else and share it and ask your friends to follow me and all that good stuff okay right now we're going to make the filling so the filling we're going to have four sticks of butter now this makes a lot of reese's cups so you might want to cut it in half if you don't want to make a whole lot but i end up giving a lot of them away and all that so when i'm making them i just go ahead and make a lot all right there's our four sticks of butter now we're gonna get two cups of peanut butter let me try it like this let me go ahead and get this out of here two cups of peanut butter all right there's one cup get the other cup how's everybody doing tonight y'all getting ready to make your christmas candy and your christmas cookies and all that good stuff if we make it too early then we don't have anything left by christmas but i'm gonna try to make uh different ones we're gonna make some oreo balls one night we're gonna make some coconut bon bons one night i know that's two things and we're gonna make some other stuff that you dip in chocolate so y'all pay attention to the page and you'll see it's coming but this is the first one we're going to do is the peanut butter balls i mean not peanut butter balls peanut butter cups i also make peanut butter balls but we're not going to do them we're going to do peanut butter cups because i think they're much easier and they taste so good all right let me throw this over here we're done with the peanut butter we gotta put two teaspoons of vanilla well we'll go ahead and start creaming this together i'm just going to put it in this stand mixer because i use that thing for everything so we'll just go ahead and start creaming together that butter and peanut butter and i'm gonna put in two tablespoons of vanilla i can see it's squirting out all over the place and then while that's mixing up we're going to get our chocolates and start melting our chocolates now these are little chocolate wafers you can get them in the uh like at walmart or a craft store like michael's or one of them craft stores but i got these in fairfax it's called friends cakes and candies or something look in your town and see if you have a candy making supply store and you get these in they're little these are the chocolate ones they're just little wafers and we're going to melt them we're going to melt them in this thing here it's called the double boiler so we're going to put i'll probably put about a half a pound or so i don't know how how many it's going to take i'll put about half in there and i'm going to turn this iron over here and over here i got a little pot that's got some water in it so the idea is the double boiler that water's gonna steam up and melt this chocolate so we're gonna let that start to melt while we're whipping this up then i'm gonna get right back to you right we cream that together next we're going to add some powdered sugar it's going to take two and a half to three pounds now this is a two pound bag so i know i'm gonna put most of this i'm gonna put all of this bag in there and then some we'll go ahead and start doing it a little bit at a time hopefully it won't go all over my counter start putting in a little bit at a time and in the meantime we're melting our candy over there starting to melt and i'll get right back to you when i get all the sugar put in all right y'all put those uh two pounds of powdered sugar in there and this is about another pound so that would be three but i think i'm only gonna do about half of this so that would be about two and a half pounds and i had to change and put my dough hook on here because this is getting to be pretty thick and it was it was flying that powder all over the place you gotta watch want to throw that powdered sugar all over the place i'm gonna let this mix and come right back at you all right it's almost mixed up now what we're gonna do is we have these little paper cups i'm gonna lay some of these out we're gonna make us some little balls out of our peanut butter put them in these cups here all right i'll get started and show you this is what your peanut butter filling is going to look like this big old clump of stuff [Music] and you just take it out and you just got to see how much is going to fit in whatever size cup she got because you want to be able to go down in the cup and then we're going to cover the top of it with them you can put chocolate in the bottom you just have to kind of guess what size cup you got here we'll try a couple and see now you don't want to get too much in there or you overflow your cup usually i just go ahead and put them in and let the chocolate go around it and i don't worry about putting chocolate on the bottom that's just an extra step let me pull this out here so you can see all right so we gotta i'm gonna go ahead and fill these up and then i'm gonna show you how we're gonna do our chocolate be right back all right here's our chocolate melting now i wasn't paying attention to it you got to really pay attention to it i got it i think a little bit too hot and it gets kind of a little bit thick that's a little bit thick to work with so what you got to do when you go to that candy store you buy a bag of these it's called paramount crystals and you sprinkle some of them in there don't take many and you melt them in there and that thins your chocolate down see how that does it melts in there and now look at that chocolate it's getting thinner because we want it thin we want to be able to pour it over these things all right so we're going to put a few more in here i want to make sure it's thin enough to pour just melt them in there real quick keep that on keep that on low there all right here we go now the way i do it as i pour this into this little cup i might have to have a oh yeah i'm going to splash it around because i don't see so good well hang on a minute i got to get a funnel all right let's try this again with the funnel i guess you can see that right there all right we're gonna get as much of this we're gonna fill this little cup up this is and i bought this little thing at the candy supply store where they have the candy supplies they sell these little things they're about two dollars for this little squeeze thing but you'll see how much easier it is here in a minute all right we're going to push all our chocolate down in there and i'm just stick stick that stuff right back over there put the lid on this now some people microwave this but i wouldn't recommend it it's not really you're supposed to melt your chocolate and then do this so if you can see i'm gonna see how it just starts coming out you can just go from one to one so right now i'm putting a little bit of chocolate in each one of these cups and what that'll do when you put our peanut butter in i got nine of them right here going i'll try to show you we're just going to press that down and just put your ball down in there press it down into that chocolate and you can see the chocolate's going to come up over the peanut butter just pressing each one down in that chocolate just like that just like that and then you're going to come back and you're just going to cover it up just cover the top you don't need a whole lot of extra chocolate over how much you really want can you kind of see that there so they go pretty fast if you got one of these little squeezy things i guess you could use an old ketchup bottle or something if you wanted to so that looked pretty good just shake them there a little bit like this on the counter let's see bring it toward me like this and then see how they look and they'll harden up and they're gonna be good i'm gonna come right back and show you all right y'all can kind of see right here that one tube of stuff that i squirted in here it made 25 of these and these are pretty good sized reesy cups now you can buy a smaller cup but i already had these so that's the size i'm making all right talk to y'all later all right i want y'all to know i already made 71 of these size reese's cup and this is how much filling i had left over so i'm going to put that in the refrigerator until i can get more chocolate and i went ahead and cut one and two so y'all can see it how rich and creamy the inside is real smooth it's not grainy like a real reesy cup it's real smooth that's good alright bye bye", "OMqzoe_O5R8": "ladies and gentlemen let's try again oh no

I am bringing you two\ndelicious sweet treat recipes. That's right. And they're going to be gluten free,\ndairy free, super filled with fun. Alright. Hey, this is Emma from the future. So what I just said doesn't exactly line\nup with the thumbnail, but trust me, we'll get there. You've seen my channel before. You know that things have to\ngo wrong before they go, right? That's how to separate dessert cups. Ended up becoming one, which is kind\nof beautiful if you think about it. Anyway, enjoy the video,\nEmma, from the future out. And it's the celebrate celiac awareness\nweek in March, which is on the 13th until the 20th of March. You know what I thought, Hey, why not\nrun my husband and I ragged and do a recipe every single week. And so that's the stop. We have chocolate peanut\nbutter cups, name a bed, a duo. You will eat peanut butter, smooth or\ncrunchy, your preference, cacao powder, coconut oil, a favorite amongst many. So. And it kinda be like, and\nyour sweetener of choice. You might be wondering, Emma, I'm you\nagainst health, wellness, Wang, crease that of stuff like this. You know what I am, but you know what\nelse I was like, Hey, I want to spend $27 on a little jar of this just to see\nwhat it's like to see what all the fuss is about. And you know what. It's just something to use. But if you don't have this totally\nblind, just use maple syrup, honey Stevia, if you're so inclined, a Garvey\nnectar, coconut nectar, the so many things you can use. Make sure it's a liquid though, because\notherwise it'll be super grainy. Okay. For the coconut oil,\nwe're going to melt it. Can we coconut an oil? It's one of those like health wellness\nthings that people think is so amazing for you, but you know what? It's just coconut oil and it\njust works well in this recipe. And it doesn't taste too coconutty. Ugh, gross. Let's get this marker waived up. So now that that's done, let's add\nit into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. You have cacao powder, peanut\nbutter, smooth some soap. One time I over salted, one of my\nbrownies I made and it was just like a, it was like casing the\nocean over and over again. Let's put in some of this monk roots. We are in a, huh? I feel like a scientist every time I use\nthis, you want to keep mixing it around until there's no lumps\nand it's pretty smooth. We want our lives to\ngo smoothly as well. We don't need any of that drama. We don't eat any of that chaos. We want to have a Saturday afternoon\nfilled with ease, relaxation, chocolate, peanut butter. You were lucky because I\nbought some new molds today. You might be wondering why I have such\nsmall little pups and why there's so much of this. Well, I wanted to make a little\nbit extra because it's just fun. Yum's like, why not? But also. That's why it's fine if no, actually\nit was their race. I thought it was her. It is. Who would win in a fight? Chocolate. A peanut butter. I think peanut butter cause\nit's a bit thicker, you know. Chocolate's amazing. But um, yeah, just unfortunately\na bit more sensitive. I'm sure you could probably do it the\nway needed and what I'm doing now. In fact, I have no doubt that you could\ndo it way later than where that I'm doing it. I'm going to put these\nbad boys in the freezer. Cup number two is our caramel carbs. That's right. But before we get onto that. If this was the kind of content you like\nto have, why don't we give it a like one? I'll give it a subscribe. Why not encourage me to keep making this\nkind of content if you a cane, because I really helps me. I'm a words of affirmation kind of gal,\nbut otherwise, let's get on onto the recipe, but this one, we're\ngoing to need maple syrup tahini. Hold on, hold you decide and coconut\nbutter, three life-changing ingredients that are going to make you most\ndelicious caramel cups you've ever freaking tasted. I had so many that I got sick. We are going to put this in the\nmicrowave for a little bit of time. You don't want a Lumbee caramel. I've got a boat. We've got our whisk,\nbut I'm able to sear it. The most delicious of all the syrups. If you want the measurements with any\nof these recipes, I'm giving them my channel, go to my Instagram, there'll\nbe a corresponding photo, and it'll have all the measurements and the full\ninstructions of the recipe that I love to Haiti, not just good for hummus. Let's give it a slow whisk. You might be wondering why I\nchose such a small bowl for this. I have been known to break things. Alex and I have been married for almost\nfour years, and I've almost single handedly broken all about glasses. Our guests drink out of mugs, so when\nI can find something that's sturdy, liable, then I just lock it down. I trap him, lock them down,\nand then they can't leave. So when it looks at smooth and delicious\nand lush and Royal, it looks Royal. We're going to go and\nput it in a little cups. As you can see, our previous cups\nhave already started to harden. Let's add to the fun. Here's a celiac FAC. May contains. So any product that has an ingredients\nlist and it says may contain weed, Bali, gluten, any of that stuff is not\nactually celiac friendly because there is a high chance of that still\ncontaining gluten either because of cross contamination and the production\nline or because things weren't cleaned properly. And so as a result, we need to view that\nas may contain poison, not to fear my gut, not to make us not\nempowered enough food choices. But just so that we're aware that even\njust a little bit of gluten is toxic to us and we are worthy of safe food. You know what, this would\nbe great with as well. You can put this sauce\non your ice cream. You can put it on your hot\ncross buns on your toes. Oh, you little muesli bars and\nyou make it home on your popcorn. Oh my gosh. Can you imagine this on your popcorn? Amazing. Let's put this in the freezer, shall we? Hey guys, it wouldn't be my channel if\nsomething didn't get put as a roadblock in the middle. So the chocolate peanut butter cups. Perfect. Right? So good. Right? However, the caramel cups slightly\nsolid, mostly gelatinous, just in case they do not end up freezing. I told you that we had some leftover\nand then I was gonna use them up. So you know what we're going to do? We're going to lay them y'all. We're going to put a chocolate peanut\nbutter caramel cup masterpiece together, and you know what? They're going to be better than\nthe caramel cups on the earth. This was meant to be\nexactly what I'm doing now. You thought it was just\ngoing to be caramel. Nah, but you know what? Because it's not going to freeze, but it\nmight still might still freeze, but in case it doesn't, it'll be an amazing\ngooey center in these chocolate cups. So it's been a day fun fact. This is a real kitchen. We've been praying better. Look old. Turned out fine. I'm going to put the rest of\nthese back in the freezer. I'm going to deal with\nthem in my own time. And then we have our hybrid of the\nchocolate peanut butter cups and the caramel cups. I'm interested to see a cross section. Let's open one up cross-section. Absolutely perfect. We've got chocolate peanut butter cups\ncombined with caramel cups making for a good time. Yeah. These work that well. Thank you. My husband just was like, will. Yeah, dude. I'm going to give it a buy it. I kid you not. These are probably the\nbest things I've not, Oh my gosh. This turned out Alex wanna try some. The chocolate Houghton\nperfectly as it's meant to. Had a good, nice. You know, snap in this delicious caramel\ninner like so smooth, so sweet, and so lush. You won't need more than one because\nit is so rich and delicious and wow. That was like literally\nthe best thing of me. I'm gonna take a bite of my\ntruck, peanut butter cups. I know they're going to be delicious\nbecause I've had them before. So good. And you put these in the freezer cause\nas you can see, I'm a mess, but I don't mind. I just know that many, many,\nmany people bind reminder. These are a frozen treat. So you shouldn't take them out unless\nyou're going to eat them straight away. They're not something\nyou can just take out. Leave for a bit at a party. So we filmed an outro yesterday. An ending that now completely\ndoesn't make sense. Oh my gosh, that turned out perfectly. Especially those caramel cups. They froze so well and\nthey came out so perfectly. I would like to do a refresh. Outro saying thank\ngoodness I turned out okay. So subscribe. Give us a like one or comment if you\nwere as surprised as I wasn't turned out. Okay.

friends and family it's cousin ryan and since it's the week leading up to halloween i thought it would be fun to try a couple different halloween candy items with you guys first off we've got reese's peanut butter cup pumpkins that have reese's pieces in them now i'm a big fan of both reese's peanut butter cups and reese's pieces so this really uh spoke to me as i saw it in the candy aisle and then we've got reese's pieces white pumpkins big white chocolate fan so i thought these are both something we need to try out on the channel here and give you my opinion so i'm going to just crack these open now right off the bat that does not really look like the pumpkin on the wrapper here but as long as it tastes good that's all that matters this is peanut butter goodness and carol i'm thinking of you right now after that peanut butter cup ben and jerry's i'm liking this a lot i'm really liking this a lot the reese's peanut pieces are sort of indistinguishable in there you can feel a little crunch from them and it's just a slight crunch but oh my gosh those are good all right interestingly enough these are 160 calories a piece and the white chocolate ones are 180 so there's 20 extra calories with the white chocolate who would have guessed and again i mean it would be cool i think it would be cool if they stamped the pumpkin face into these that would be a nice extra little cool touch but they don't so we're gonna eat them anyway wow i wasn't sure how i'd feel about the white chocolate and the peanut butter but i'm a fan i'm a big fan i'd say both of these are a buy um i will recommend both the hersh or excuse me the real hershey's reese's pieces reese's peanut butter cup reese's pieces peanut butter cups and the reese's pieces white chocolate pumpkins both really

Africans made peanut stews peanut butter as we know it today was invented in 1890 by an American doctor he used it as a protein substitute for people whose teeth were so bad they couldn't chew meat the best peanuts for making peanut butter are runner peanuts because their uniform in size they roast more evenly than peanuts that vary in size they arrive at the peanut butter factory already shelled to make a 500 gram jar of peanut butter it takes 565 grams of peanuts that's about 1,100 peanuts the first step is to roast them the nuts travel through a hot-air roaster heated to 204 degrees Celsius the shaking motion moves them around so they roast evenly more than 3,600 kilograms of peanuts go through this roaster per hour when they come out they've turned from white to light brown next they go into another machine which fast cools them at room temperature using suction fans that circulate air quickly this rapid cooling process is critical it halts the cooking and prevents the peanuts from losing too much oil next the peanuts go through a machine called the blancher it removes the outer skins by rubbing them between rubber belts then it splits the kernels and removes the heart of the peanut which has a slightly bitter taste but what's discarded doesn't go to waste the skins go to farmers for pig feed and the hearts go into bird feed the peanuts land in a big stainless steel hopper from there they drop down into the grinder to be ground into a paste at this point the other ingredients go in salt sugar or another natural sweetener and a small amount of hydrogenated vegetable oil which acts as a stabilizer to keep the peanut oil from separating and floating to the top of the jar peanut butter contains no artificial coloring or artificial sweeteners it has no preservatives either yet doesn't need to be refrigerated the peanut butter is finally ready all that mixing has heated it up to 60 degrees Celsius it goes through a cooling system to bring it down to 38 degrees now it can go into jars peanut butter is a healthy protein rich food with plenty of vitamins minerals and fiber it has no cholesterol but it does contain fat the good news is that more than 80% of that fat is unsaturated in other words good fat that may actually help lowers certain cholesterol levels in the blood the bad news is that the rest of the fat content is trans fat or bad fat it comes not from the peanuts themselves but from the hydrogenated vegetable oil that's used as the stabilizer to keep the peanut oil from separating if you want to avoid that you can eat all-natural peanut butter which doesn't contain a stabilizer you'll just have to stir the peanut oil that collects at the top of the jar once the jars are filled with peanut butter they go through the capping machine the caps have an aluminum seal inside as the caps pass through a heat machine the seal drops down and adheres to the top of the jar creating an airtight seal a machine prints the production date and the expiration date these unopened jars of peanut butter will stay fresh for one whole year", "ADIDkjTK93w": "[Music] yo what's going on guys this looki from a little TV and we're back with a

cases and you need a tray and you need a big bowl so let's get started first of all you have to melt the chocolate so I will see you okay I so while that's melting you want to pour in your butter and you have to beat it okay guys so now I'm done beating and the butter so now we're gonna pour in the icing sugar and we're gonna mix oh and the icing sugar doesn't go everywhere and now what you do is guess what can it be technical now so now is creamy so now we're gonna pour in the peanut butter so I be I pour it and my peanut butter so now we're gonna be in it now we're gonna go to the next step okay guys so now we're gonna add in two tablespoons or chocolate and in our cases one red more and now we're gonna tap like this and now you want to get your peanut butter or filling and you want to

be making peanut butter cup stuffed brownie cookies chocolate chip cookies at that doesn't that sound good but before we get started if this is your first time here don't forget to Like and subscribe especially if you like tips and tricks for your kitchen and sometimes really unique recipes and sometimes just stuff that I make everyday so to get started with this one though I have already made up some peanut butter not peanut butter excuse me chocolate chip cookies and normally I would use just what you buy in the store in the roll but they were out so I just made my own and I just used a chocolate chip cookie mix you can make your own from scratch too but I'm gonna set that aside for now the next thing I want to do is mix up some brownie batter so we're just gonna use a regular brownie from the box so 1/4 cup of water the brownie mix and I don't think we're gonna have enough room in here I decided to put it in here because well because it has a spout on the bowl and I thought it'd be easier to pour so I've got to grab another Bowl okay I think we're ready now I'm gonna dump this in here yeah and we'll get it all mixed up better in a little bit all right so I'm gonna put in 2/3 of a cup of oil and chew eggs and then we're just gonna get this all stirred together all right that looks good but I do want to go and scrape the rest of this down make sure I guess that wasn't the most brightest idea but oh well alright so one last stir here and then I have got 12 peanut butter cups so you need a package of 6 is what you need so 12 cups and all before we add those in we're gonna go ahead and take our cookie dough and I've got one of my little small scoops here my stainless steel scoops and I'm just going to put a scoop in each one of these alright looks like we have a little bit left we'll have to save that for a snack later and then I'm just gonna push down on my dough into my pan alright so once we have all the cookie dough pressed down we can go ahead and add our peanut butter cups and I got to tell you I saw where it said six on the recipe so I got six but I got the individual ones and actually with six packages of like a regular candy bar so you get two in a package so it was twelve so I had to go buy more and what I realized was I bought these at all D's and I bought these I think at the gas station or somewhere oh so if you go to all these new thing you're getting a really good deal look at the difference in those really not so what I want to do is turn these upside down and I'm gonna put all my bigger ones on this side I'm gonna put my smaller ones on this side so that way I can see which works out best and I'm putting these in here upside down so when we pour our brownie batter it goes right over the top and kind of spreads out and I'm given them like a little push just to make sure they go down in the cookie dough a little bit alright and then yeah this would have been much better if I could pour this with a spout anyway we are gonna go ahead and pour the brownie batter over the top just enough to fill the cups alright so once you have them all filled up it's time to put them in the oven and hopefully these don't rise too much this first time I've made these I just saw this recipe the other day and I thought my husband would probably love these I have to make them so the ovens on 350 degrees I'm gonna put them in there for about 18 to 20 minutes and like I said hopefully they don't rise too much because they are filled to the brim so I just took them out of the oven and I started take him all the pain and I thought I better stop I want to show you how I got him out so what I did was I let him cool for about 10-15 minutes and then I just slowly ran the edge of my knife around here so again you want to let him cool just a little bit so they kind of set up and they're just a little bit firmer and then like I said run your knife all the way around the edge and you want to keep the bottom of your knife really pressed against the side so you're not cutting into the brownie and then run it around and it should loosen it and you know cutting brownies is always just a little bit tricky especially if you're like me and you like a moist you go to cut them and you just get like most of the insides of the brownie all over the knife what I found that helps is if you use a plastic knife to cut your brownies but we're doing something a little bit different here today so then I just flipped my pan over and the ones that I ran my knife around came right out so I just really gently turned them back over I don't want to flatten them too much and then I'm just gonna let them cool and then I'll probably photograph on but I know you guys would probably want to see what the inside of these look like so I'm gonna go ahead cut it open but I gotta be honest like peanut butter is not like my favorite I do like homemade peanut butter but look at that it's not really melty I guess peanut butter cups don't melt really like peanut butter melt I mean the homemade peanut butter I make is like really creamy but peanut butter cups have like sugar mixed in with the peanut butter so I guess I was expecting it just to be creamy in the center but let's give it a bite I was much more than a cookie super super rich definitely chocolatey and peanut buttery it really is like a peanut butter cup and a cookie all mixed together anta brownie i mean it's really really good especially if you like peanut butter cups and I would probably like it better if I had a big glass of milk or while it's still warm maybe some ice cream on anyway I think these are a lot of fun to make and I'm betting you could do different types of cookies on the bottom and maybe different types of like maybe candy bars in there I know I've made a brownie that has like a Snickers little Snickers bars in the bottom of it that I do in my rock crock I may have to do that for a video too someday but anyway I hope you all enjoyed that this was a lot of fun so thank you so much for watching I will see you next time bye [Music]", "o1Hy1ikrjR8": "hello everybody it's your boy chillwill and today i

are on discount at my local Dollar General whatever reason it was 85 cent everything was 50% off so this end up being forty-three cents so that's a good deal that's that's how much you used to be a

didn't like dark chocolate I'm gonna do it on minute ribs and they had like the 102 I hated it what do we don't get I don't mind dark chocolates now what do you know don't get that you only taste the

weren't delicious enough when you had peanut butter to the mix wealth hits nuts and my chocolate peanut butter truffle cups are outrageously good layer upon layer chocolate and peanut butter so I'm gonna start with a chocolate crust it's easy enough to whip up by hand and this makes 12 individual truffle cups that's 1/2 a cup of flour and I'll add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and in this case it doesn't matter if you use regular cocoa powder or a Dutch process I'll drop in 3 tablespoons of sugar and give that a quick sift is basically a shortbread style crust very simple this is 6 tablespoons of unsalted butter that I've let come up to room temperature and I just use a pastry cutter you can even use two butter knives and work the butter in there we go so now I spoon a little into the bottom of each cup just loosely for now and then you can use the bottom of a glass or a tamping tool like this I dip it in flour and I just gently press down this is all set for the oven which I have at 350 and it only takes 12 minutes to bake ah very nice they are cooled you want to let them cool completely before you fill them see how they level out so they're all set for that peanut butter truffle filling so the first thing I do is measure 6 ounces of dark chocolate in here I have six tablespoons of creamy peanut butter I'll add a tablespoon and a half of corn syrup and now I'll take this over to my water bath this really is the best way to melt chocolate just an inch of water and it's really just the soft gentle steam that slowly melts the chocolate go now that this is melted it's ready for the first truffle layer you can really smell that peanut butter now what I'm going to do is pour in just a thin layer over each of the crusts just enough to coat it doesn't have to coat completely you can really see how smooth that is I bet you didn't guess you could make truffle filling out of just chocolate and peanut butter now what I do is just give it a little shake and it spreads that truffle layer now it's time for the next truffle layer this time I work in white chocolate with a peanut butter it's a smaller amount two and a half ounces of white chocolate and I'm working a combination of cream and peanut butter into this layer I need five tablespoons of cream that's the same as 75 milk pour that right in I'll take this back to my water bath again and just melt this until it's smooth I'll set it aside to cool just a little bit I've got three tablespoons of soft butter and I'll add to that six tablespoons of peanut butter just combine these together now that this is nice and smooth I can add my chocolate cream mixture combine that and now for the icing sugar 3/4 of a cup that quick sift in I don't know about you but I love when a peanut butter filling has that little bit of salt to it so I add a quarter teaspoon of salt if you need to you can switch to a whisk at this point to smooth it all out I'm just going to drop my piping bag that's fitted with a plain tip into a glass because my filling is fluid it just makes it easier to fill this way [Music] nice even layer and just like with the dark chocolate layer and give them a little shimmy just make sure it's nice and level now back to this dark chocolate peanut butter truffle mix I'm gonna pour on top of each and another little shimmy and then the finishing touch a little chopped peanuts right in the center of each now these truffle cups need a little bit of chill time a few hours to set up but once they've set up they can actually be stored at room temperature [Music] and here they are out of the fridge fully set this is what I love because once you pull them out you can see the layers even with the paper cups peel it away you can see the combination of the cookie crust then chocolate peanut butter then white chocolate peanut butter and more dark chocolate peanut butter mm-hmm I know where the milk is [Music]", "0a0PMss8BA0": "hey chefs what's up welcome back to my youtube channel

it's a very good thing to have because it makes the chocolate so much smoother that is not proper grammars sorry um and it just tastes a lot better and then we have our double boiler with some boiling water and a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips you can use um like a bar of chocolate you can use fancy chocolate whatever chocolate you can use but we're just using some simple chocolate chips okay let's get cooking okay so now that we have our ingredients so so we have our chocolate and our boiling pour it in and then you put our coconut oil and you want like okay sorry okay look how beautiful this chocolate is can you see this there's like no chunks and it's melted so fast so okay our chocolate is done melting like look at this it's very bad so good so beautiful amazing and then so all you have to have is your chocolate and some like peanut butter because reese's have peanut butter and sugar but we just need peanut butter and you can use cookie butter and like sun butter and any butter that works for you because there are so many allergies out there so this is a great way to make it unique to your diet or what you can can't eat so the supplies you will need are silicon molds okay i don't care how to pronounce it um silicon mode molds and um we're using these cute little heart shaped ones and i have ruffles on the sides yours can be totally straight if you want but these are so cute and then if you want to do the design on a little marbling um that we're doing with peanut butter you can get some toothpicks and use those for it and then you are going to need however many people you have you're gonna need that amount of spoons to scoop stuff up so okay so now i'm to teach you how to make one so of course you need your silicone molds because we're using some cute heart-shaped ones we said earlier so first you're going to grab some i mean some chocolate and then you're gonna add some peanut butter on top of that yeah so much peanut butter and then you're gonna just add a little more chocolate over it to cover up all of the beautiful yummy peanut butter okay so now i'm gonna teach you how to do a twirling technique so now that she has made her so i'm just gonna give her mine yeah and i am going to do a swirling technique so what you're going to do is take a a toothpick and go ahead and dip it in some peanut butter really good and then put it on your thing and just swirl it around and get all that excess peanut butter as well get it really really good just make sure make sure not to dip it back into your peanut butter because you don't really want chocolate in your pizza no matter yeah so once you're done with that you can just um put it down or somewhere where it won't get messy very beautiful so now all you have to do is put this in the freezer for like two to three hours and then your beautiful chocolates will be done yep let's put it in the freezer this is what they look like so once you have let them freeze you can go ahead and clean up make make sure that you make cleaning up a super fun way okay okay so we're peeling hours out mine whoa that's so easy okay i got my now that's so good okay so eva made hers very cleanly and she's going to she lives here it's hard to focus i'm gonna come back so there is eva's she probably put some chocolate chips on the top but in the outer layer i put a little like outer layering and it's like so clean and nice okay sorry guys the focus is not very good but it's so beautiful and they do tend to start melting but like they just look so good like look at that and you can like i did i made this a little differently i did peanut butter chocolate peanut butter and then some chocolate chips on top so let's see mia's okay so mine has sticks in it because we wanted to know whose was who's because i do have to take mine home the side is pretty clean and the top is just swirled and the side right here broke a little bit but that's because the peanut butter didn't freeze properly but overall i think it's really good you guys gotta start making your own make sure to hit that like button and subscribe and the most important thing cut cook see you guys next time bye as you guys noticed i did have some chocolate on my mouth but that is totally okay i couldn't resist trying one before filming this undoing them and they are so good you guys really gotta try this recipe bye", "yi2fuW9KKgw": "[Music] we're back with another ron reviews unless you're a stranger to the channel you know i'm down with peanut butter and i might be a small reese's peanut butter fan so anytime i get a chance to try new reese you know i'm down for it new from reese's it's the chocolate lovers peanut butter cups we'll also be looking at the new reese's take five arguable two american reese's products that i just recently got from a box from rare snacks toronto massive reese fan massive peanut butter fan sweet and salty always hits the spot i love reese let's check these out disclaimer i tried to get the peanut butter lovers but they sold it so i went with the chocolate lovers we're going to start with the take five and this is what the reese's take five looks like you get two of these bars per pack take five is a classic bar one of my favorites delicious hershey's chocolate caramel peanuts peanut butter all on top of a pretzel it is a magical burn here's the disclaimer apparently it was always made with reese's peanut butter so really this is just a branding change but i got no problem with that because this bear wasn't standing before and now that we know for sure it's reese in there it makes sense sweet and salty and still in my opinion one of the best spurs let's try out the reese's take five let's do it oh guys it's one of the perfect combinations salty crunchy pretzel the crunch from the peanuts a little bit of salt from the sweet peanut butter with the caramel and then the classic chocolate outstanding seriously it is one of the best bars i've ever had and with an orange package it still holds true absolutely delicious guys what does ron think of the new reese's take five bear it's not new it was always rhys but it's a nice new package seriously one of the best i've ever had sweet salty crunchy all the notes in this one guys ron's given the reese's take five ten out of ten amazing bar so let's move on to the actual new product [Applause] and this is how the chocolate lovers cup comes in the package as i mentioned with all reese products it comes down to that ratio let's check this one out we'll note the peanut butter didn't stick on bottom i guess it's well coated and this is how the chocolate lovers cup looks guys it doesn't seem overly different maybe a little bit more on the sides let's check it out yeah so what i'm noticing is it's more on the sides not on top and bottom so it still should have a great ratio the american chocolate is a little bit different than canadian so other than that it should be that classic reese i love reese can't wait let's try it it's reese guys sorry it was melting on my fingers i had to put it back in the little wrapper sweet salty everything you love about a reese with just a touch more chocolate not a whole lot but enough to say it's a change the biggest thing i'm noticing is the difference between the hershey chocolate other than that it's only a slight bit more chocolate but it doesn't mess with that ratio a whole lot so it's still a very satisfying race experience so what does ron think of the reese's chocolate lovers peanut butter cup a touch more chocolate but everything classic a better wreath cup so you know i am down with it and just something magical about a reese's cup guys i gotta give this the exact same as i would a reese's peanut butter cup ron's giving the chocolate lovers reese's cup 10 out of 10. nothing beats a reese's cup well there we go a quick look at two new american bars that i finally got to try well arguably new the reese's take five and a reese's chocolate lovers peanut butter cup i love reese i love these guys you need to check them out if you're in canada and you want to get your hands on this check out rare snacks toronto if they haven't been stuck they'd be glad to hook you up it's been another quick round reviews and see you guys next time you", "2UikS_gi1Ik": "it's a long time since we've done a YouTube video how does it feel to be back feels good I recorded a YouTube video I recently quit my job so there's that so I'm hoping start recording again every Friday and uploading every Sunday and we are back to our second fight videos guys we're gonna compare a traditional treat to an healthier option and see which one is better or see if the healthy option can replace this sweet treat whatever okay so we're back to it today is peanut butter cop skies peanut butter cups this is like my childhood and it can't be Weesa pick these out of the like Halloween candy bowl so that we wouldn't pass it out to other kids we have seen these and all of their sister counterparts on the market they claim to be like organic and healthier while all the important ingredients in this are organic they are almost identical to what's in a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so calendar riots we're looking at 230 and 210 so not a big difference there and again you might find how your calories and healthier options just because it's more wholesome ingredients and the day those can be more calorie dense but irrelevant to what we're talking about today both have quite a bit of added sugar 16 grams 22 grams I mean this is 16 grams of fat 15 grams of fat and 12 grams about here and let's talk the saturated fats for a second this has 8 grams of saturated fat and this has 4.5 it actually has more saturated bad interesting saturated fats definitely the one that's not the best for you but those monounsaturated that's whatever those are the ones that are better for you that we find peanut butter not butter and all that stuff but anyways this is a good saturate this is half the amount of saturated fat so just you know to put it out there this also has quite a few more ingredients in this little guy over here and most of them aren't like abnormal from what you would find in chocolate but you know a cane sugar elect in the random other chemicals that keep things fresh or longer same thing here this one has I don't know what TBHQ is but I might look that up citric acid to maintain freshness dextrose sugar so buh-buh-buh-buh stop anyway so really at the end of the day these two are not that different the homemade version the whole my version is gonna have five ingredients so that's just chocolate I use enjoy life chocolate tips not sponsored but wish it was so hey you know no added ingredients in my peanut butter maple syrup no had an ingredients in my Mabel syrup coconut oil obviously no other ingredients Matt and I'm vanilla extract it so just five ingredients it takes about an hour to make if you include freezing times but if you're not including freezing times when you could be doing something else then I would say max 15 to 25 minutes actually super quick so I'm gonna pull those out of the freezer now cuz I actually already made them and I'm gonna have you guys watch that in just a second my brother and his wife are coming over they're gonna try all three options today I'm so super excited for that we're gonna see which one they like better I really have faith in the ones I need guys I really think that these might be the winner today but a lot of candy guys so I don't know are you ready cuz I'm ready also a loser I've actually never tried these before I so kind of excited for that but definitely sorry her she's sorry Reese's you are losing today I am so by an especially busy playing this game but I love it so which one are we going to take a second by of but anyways I really just go cuz I talk too much [Music] that's it you know it's real life I made this they selling anthem you know really like look at that we have your traditional Orissa cut okay Justin's reishi cap okay so this is the marketed healthier version that is sold basically everywhere but like we talked about their ingredients are still still long ingredient list and not necessarily a healthier option and then this is the whole made version so only ingredients are chocolate chips coconut oil maple syrup and peanut butter MIDI 911 married brother sister-in-law my brother my sister okay so um actually don't miss candy like this isn't something that I would crave you know but it is really good Justin's got never had me neither [Music] that looks like almond butter peanut butter I just tried to pick a better straight yeah thank you falling out of the cup it's interesting I like that one is not a sweet but like after you've had that it's like the texture is these are hard guys everyone needs to take them the texture is right there so did all have peanut butter yeah okay this is our homemade [Laughter] hmm I feel like I've never tried an almond joy but it tastes like melon join them this has to go back to the second bite like what when you take a second bite of this little salmon I would take a second bite of this versus anything else I would take a second bite of this one I think I would especially know he was homey this is really good it's actually a surprise I think the best thing of all mm-hmm so some of the end cut off just a little bit but the verdict was that the homemade one was the best wine we all might agree that going back for a second bite on the homemade one was better than going for a second bite on the Reese's Cup and the Justin's Reese's Cup but even a laden said I went back to the Reese's Cup after trying leanness and it just didn't compare and I the taste was muted the sugar did it have the same [Music] before yeah attached to it and it wasn't it really just felt guilty afterwards having Leena's was a better eating experience and it tasted better and I have to say I'm surprised right yes this is a candy guy for the home yes indeed anyways just ban just saying the healthier option can totally be better [Music] peace out guys follow me at living with Lena for more tips recipes and fun right that's where I like the work outside the fun stuff is you see my face every day don't forget to live locally my", "mhxYsEusUW8":

delicious just as it is and if you head over to that recipe she has tons of comments of followers and fans that absolutely love this recipe but let's take it up a notch chalk zero has came out with peanut butter cups i mean come on peanut butter cookies peanut butter cups do you know where i'm going here a peanut butter cookie cup remember them we haven't had them because there hasn't been

in this video I'm gonna show you how to make one of my new favorite smoothies I'll have it sometimes in the morning for breakfast I'll have it throughout the day sometimes I'll have a post-workout like it's a good all-around smoothie pack of protein tastes awesome before I get into it though I did want to send a shout out a big THANK YOU to kasoori if that's how you say it I hope it is they sent me this personal blender in the description you'll see a link to where you can get a discount on from November 15th through December 15th use that link you'll get a discount on the price but yeah I'm super excited to use this thing it's new it can do so many like things I haven't even read all the stuff that it can do but it can do like smoothies salsas it's got a few different settings on there like pulse auto blend - this thing is nice I got these extra cups so here's like the blender cup here's the actual like machine so and then it comes with these two extra cups so like you know to-go cups all these lids are interchangeable so that's awesome it's got like a little cleaner for it right here this thing a little cleaner and then I got some instructions in here which I have not opened yet which I probably should but we're just gonna get into this smoothie I hope you guys enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] it's creamy smooth and delicious thus for real is one of my new favorite smoothies there are obviously some alternatives that you could have used don't think that like when I make these things you have to make them the exact same way like you can try different things you can use different items like so for the almond milk for instance some people like to use regular milk I just regular milk doesn't sit well with my body so I don't use regular milk I think on the milk is healthier again that's kind of why I use it and then I used you know two bananas frozen I think frozen worked better in these smoothies you could have used fresh bananas or you could have went with one banana instead of two if you wanted to cut back on the carbs a little bit I used the optimal nutrition gold standard whey extreme chocolate milk there are many other protein flavors and you know options out there you don't have to use all nutrition you don't have to use the chocolate milk make it the way that you want to make it but this is one of my favorite ways to make this movie and I really enjoy it I think you have to try it also make sure to check out that kasoori the lender links are in the description I also will have a video coming about they sent me a pressure cooker as well

into the taste test of the reese's and peanut butter cups i just want to make a quick announcement so first of all sorry for the shorter length videos it's all i'm able to do still such as taste tests the grey stuff but hopefully next month our government is going to relax a lot down so that will mean being able to meet up with people and travel we also have a massive announcement possibly coming next week i need to make my mind whether to share it next week or not so yeah um hope you enjoyed this short clip and hopefully more travel videos will be soon which i can't wait to film for you guys peace okay guys welcome to another video so today we are trying um white reese's peanut butter cups so i did find these in the local store when i went shopping um and as a bit of context me and ignite the fire did try peanut butter cups in a previous taste test video but i think it might have been one which got corrupted which was a few years back now so as you know i don't like peanut butter from the grey's video but in reese's it's okay so yeah it's just basically a white reese's peanut butter cup i know in america these are probably really common for you but over here we don't even have butter fingers anymore so yeah let's give it a shot way softer mm-hmm okay i i can uh immediately tell it is better than the gray's peanut butter that was really bitter but of course this probably has a ton of added sugars but as a whole it tastes a lot better um and it's melting all over me so i'm going to do something a little different in terms of packaging you've got the kind of iconic orange with white so it is quite eye-catching and in terms of the and the cup itself it comes in a little paper like holder um and the taste and texture is actually really nice the peanut butter itself is it a little gritty but i think that's how it's meant to be especially due to the added sugar and the white chocolate isn't overly sweet which i like um and the taste of nuts is strong as heck but it is peanut butter so that's how it's meant to taste so overall i think these are already good if you want me to taste butter fingers i would do that but so far reese's are nice and i think i'm going to hopefully get a bigger bag of these and enjoy these so yeah thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one guys peace", "M5jBu9XBpMM": "hey y'all today I am bringing y'all an exciting recipe we're making copy hat Reese's peanut butter cups so with things like this sitting around in my kitchen because of Easter time this gal is really wanting some Reese's in this one little 30 gram Easter Egg there is 16 grams of sugar in it no we don't need to eat that so today we are going to make a very low carb friendly Reese's peanut butter copycat so you don't feel deprived when these are in your house you're gonna make your own low-carb version then it's gonna be fabulous let me show you how to make these you're going to need just a few ingredients for this recipe you're gonna need some peanut butter powder I use jiff some swerve or some erythritol some sugar-free peanut butter this is the grind your own peanut butter that I got at Kroger some of this unsweetened baking chocolate some vanilla extract and then a mold to put your peanut butter cups in so I actually found this one on Amazon and it has the little Reese's Cup shape to it so this is what I am going to use for my molds today I've got one teaspoon of vanilla 1/2 cup of my peanut butter 1/2 cup of my powdered peanut butter and 2 tablespoons of my powdered erythritol or swerve and we are going to combine them all together in a bowl [Music] now we're going to stir this all together and combine it into a big ol homogenized mixture I ended up adding about three tablespoons of water to this mixture because I used the grind your own peanut butter it was a little bit drier than most peanut butters so it didn't have as much oil to help come bind the two but see how this is kind of like a crumbly texture you know the texture of the Reese's peanut butter center is a little bit more chalky so adding in the powdered peanut butter and mixing it to a consistency where you still can form it into a little ball but it is still kind of crumbly is I think the perfect consistency to make it taste almost exactly like a Reese's but what I'm going to do is take a little bit of my crumbly mixture and form these into little balls that will fit right into your molds so don't make them too big unless you're going for a giant Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so let me make about 25 of these or however many I can make with this because that is how many that fit into my mold let's go I got all 25 of my little peanut butter balls to go inside of my peanut butter cups and now what we're going to do is melt the chocolate to finish these off but you're gonna need some of this 100% unsweetened baking chocolate bar because I made the peanut butter very sweet I am NOT going to flavor the unsweetened baking chocolate but if you would like you can totally add some liquid stevia and stir this into the chocolate to make it a little bit sweeter for you I broke up an entire unsweetened chocolate bar into this glass measuring cup because I figured it might be easier to pour the chocolate out that may or may not work that's just my thinking now and we are going to pop this in the microwave oh and then move on my junk out of the way but we are going to pop this in the microwave for 30 second intervals and stir it every 30 seconds until it is nice and melted so let's start melting all right I've got my chocolate all liquefy this so what I'm going to do is add this chocolate to the bottom of the mold throw in one of my little peanut butter balls and then cover the top up with chocolate so let's get to porn just FYI I can guarantee y'all I'm gonna be super messy but that doesn't matter we're going for taste not prettiness okay I went back and add it in a little bit of sweetener to my melted chocolate because it was a little bit too bitter for my liking I started making such a big old giant mess I decided to make 15 of these things I'm about to stick them in the fridge and let them Harden and I will show you how they turn out I just pulled my little peanut butter cups out of the fridge and we're going to pop them out and give them a try look how cute this is you can't tell me that that's not adorable let's give it a try alright here's my little peanut butter cup Cheers does that not look like the inside of a peanut butter cup I am pretty pleased with myself right now definitely it would highly recommend sweetening that bitter unsweetened chocolate but these are really good they satisfy that craving I have for those Reese's sitting over there on the counter well guys I hope you enjoyed that

obviously either on the website or on instagram but it's gonna be at gnc and a couple other places but i really hope you come to vitamin shop and i hope you come to gas stations somewhere where i could just like run in really fast to pick it up all right we are on to product number two product number two i am very very excited about because i am a peanut butter cup connoisseur so when quest dropped these your girl was very excited so let's do a little bit of history quest has come out with a peanut butter cup before there were two peanut butter cups they were not the worst thing but they were not the best they were big they were chunky they were in kind of a they were not okay so see this package that package was like twice as big they were in two cups and you have to push like pop them out of the cup and every time i did that i would either drop it on the floor or drop it on myself or whatever so the packaging wasn't my favorite they tasted okay but they were super super dry it was a healthy peanut butter cup these are supposed to be reese's dupes i love reese's so i'm ready to be very excited or very hurt so let's talk about these things you know kind of as the way on the way i'm trying them we have less than one gram of sugar per serving the serving is both cups thank you quest for not playing us and making a serving one cup because that's messed up so we have in both of our cups 190 calories 15 grams of fat 13 carbs 4 grams of fiber less than 1 gram of sugar a little bit of the erythritol which is like a like a fake sugar kind of like aspartame or sugar alcohol and 11 grams protein so we are about to open them up and see so here's what she looks like there's both cups and all their glory right so they look promising nice and dark regular reese's size i wish i'll see take the wrapper off there we go hmm these taste just like a reese's i don't want to be gross and like talk about mouthful these taste just like a reese's these are delicious quest you absolutely nailed it these are so good you can see kind of on the inside it's like real peanut butter like instead of the powder peanut butter because that's what the other peanut butter cups were they were kind of like that powdery like pb2 peanut butter the one where you kind of mix up with the water and like turns into peanut butter this is more like actual peanut butter the chocolate is very good it's sweet it's yummy this is really really good these were at vitamin shop i got them yesterday they were 249 250 something like that but quest uh sometimes does pretty awesome sales where they like buy one get one half off or you know they especially do that with the cookies and stuff these are amazing if you like greasy cups if you're looking for a reese's cup do i 10 out of 10 recommend so this has been super fun to do i am super excited to get two you know super new things and talk about them and try them on camera with you guys have you tried either of these things yet have you gotten uh your hand on a ghost energy if you did which flavor did you get i was really torn between getting the tropical mango and the red berry the sour patch but i was so intrigued by the sour patch that i had to just go for it um have you tried the peanut butter cups what did you think is it a real thing is it uh you can kind of taste it it's not really the the real deal let me know in the comments below please let me know what you want to see next i will be linking in the description box the places to get the quest and the ghost i don't know how much longer they're going to be doing the pre-sale of the cans but i'll let you know if it's still going on and uh with that i will see you in the gym bye", "Lez8OfdMg-o": "today on drinks with Diablo don't be seized peanut butter

Kelly from misra today we are going to be making peanut butter cups these are just like Reese's peanut butter cups that you have on Halloween or find at the store but these ones are easily to be made homemade there's only two ingredients that you need for this recipe and that chocolate that you can melt I have some chocolate chips if you have a Hershey bars for example left over from s'mores or from trick-or-treating those work really well too I'm so you need 1/2 a cup of chocolate so I'm going to measure out in my cup here 1/2 a cup of chocolate I got just a little bit leftover of milk chocolate chips and I have a few leftover of semi-sweet chocolate chips it doesn't really matter whatever your taste preferences is gonna work perfectly fine so I'm going to get 1/2 a cup of chocolate in a bowl that I can put in the microwave and this is a glass bowl so I put my chocolate chips in and then I just need a quarter cup of peanut butter I'm using smooth peanut butter creamy peanut butter but you can also use crunchy peanut butter if you have that and you can also use almond butter or any kind of other nut butter that you have one trick that I've learned is that if you spray the inside of your measuring cup with some cooking spray it makes it so that the peanut butter comes out a lot easier from your measuring cup once you're ready to dump it in your Bowl so I'm going to spray my measuring cup a little bit with some cooking spray and then I'm going to measure a quarter cup of peanut butter into my measuring right this is a nice recipe too because if you don't like it a peanut buttery or if you like it with a lot of peanut butter flavor you can adjust how much peanut butter to chocolate you like in your recipe alright so I have a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a cup of chocolate chips in my bowl now I'm going to microwave it so that it's all melted and smooth I'm going to start with 30 seconds in the microwave and give it a stir and then go five seconds at a time after that until it's nice and smooth [Music] I'm done with the microwaving stuff I'm gonna come close so you can see that my peanut butter and chocolate mixture is very smooth there's no chunks at all in my mixture but it's also not very hot so I that's why the five seconds at a time is very important so that you don't overcook or burn your chocolate all right last step of this recipe is going to be to put the peanut butter cups in a cupcake tin this is a smaller cupcake tins for mini cupcakes if you have a normal size or even a jumbo size muffin tin I would suggest just filling there the cups a little bit with waxed chocolate but it doesn't really matter you can do however much do you think is a good a good amount so I'm just gonna use a spoon and I'm going to clean my mixture into the cupcake tins and now I'm gonna put this in the freezer until they cool and they're solid alright my peanut butter cups are nice and solid they've been in the freezer for an hour and a half or so so I took them out of the freezer I had a little bit of a hard time getting them out so I Rianna just a little bit of cool water around the outside to get the peanut butter cup out of the cupcake tin so I just kind of use a knife slide it down the side of the cupcake tin and it'll pop right out here we go if they're a little bit soft on the sides you can always put them back into the fridge just like this on a plate instead of in the cupcake tin that's all there is to it I hope you enjoy the street we'll see you next", "oyJkkA2UHY4": "tonight I'm reviewing peanut butter caramel from Archer farms for those of you not in the know Archer farms is targets store brand and it's pretty hit or miss and what a misses it misses big-time the brand as a whole is fairly weak but when I saw this flavor I just had to pick it up it is vanilla ice cream with that caramel peanut butter swirl and peanut butter cups and chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces sounds interesting to me I got some new ice cream I got my extra medium employee Hills shirt let's get to it first spoonful damn this is pretty good stuff stick with in a bowl oh you know there's a peanut butter cup a little mini peanut butter cup if I'm not mistaken there is some waffle cone in there as well there we go waffle cone he's actually pretty crunchy there are some other flavors have tried to do that mixed in when it comes off a little spongy you know because it gets a moist cold and it doesn't have that that crunch so off the good start here so while I haven't got a lot of swirl I got a hell of a lot a peanut butter cups mad peanut butter cups up in here we got a little waffle cone in there you can see and I'm enjoying this a lot the swirl is definitely more peanut butter and then Caruana will get much of a caramel taste out of it but it's very peanut buttery so can't really complain there's just a slew of many people under cuffs in here I found some more of that swirl and them hiding in the middle there as you can see there's peanut butter cup in there swirl it's basically a peanut butter swirl it's not really very caramel peanut butter cups on peanut butter cups now I can't vouch for your pint if you buy this Argus's for mine I'm more than satisfied with mix-ins for an archer farms ice-cream I gotta say I'm uh I'm pretty impressed now the bass is probably the worst thing about this ice cream it's just a plain lighter vanilla it was melting really quickly and it just doesn't really add much to the ice cream it's kind of just there which isn't so bad because the mix-ins carry this one big time there were tons of peanut butter cup the chocolate coated waffle cone was crunchy the swirl even though it wasn't peanut butter caramel the peanut butter swirl was tasty so I have no complaints about those elements of the ice cream at the end of the day Furniture farms he's pretty darn good probably the best flavor I've ever had from there and I give it a strong seven out of ten thanks for watching guys see you next time", "UFxpqQVezrU": "panthers thanks for keeping those haters out there today we're gonna be making the world's biggest peanut butter cup so let's go all right so what we're going to be using for like the outline of reese's paper cup um is this like pile and a half like pie outline thing it has like the little groove as you can see like right here as the groove that reese's peanut butter cup would right up here so uh yeah now let's get the ingredients the first ingredient you're gonna want is semi-sweet chocolate chips the next ingredient you're going to want is peanut butter the next ingredient you're going to want is room temperature butter and the last ingredient you want is milk chocolate chips the milk chocolate chips is a preference um we're just going to combine the two um you can really use any chocolate you want depending on what you want we're just going to use these two fruits in it all right we actually need two more things and that is a bowl and some sugar so uh now we're gonna get on to melting the chocolate so let's get into it all right guys so we're gonna need a decent amount since we're building a big one we're gonna need a layer of chocolate on the bottom of the bowl um like on this bowl right here we're gonna layer um we're gonna need bottom layer chocolate peanut butter chocolate so we're gonna need enough to do both layers of chocolate so we're gonna probably fill it up to this line so we're gonna do two thirds of just like semi-sweet chocolate so like something like that and then or like maybe like that and then we're gonna have some this milk chocolate we're gonna add a little bit of milk chocolate in there give that like a little bit of layer and maybe a few more like just a little bit more just to fill it up a little bit more should be enough um yeah all right so now we're going to basically be putting this in the microwave so we're just going to get in the microwave and since there's a lot of chocolate we're just gonna add it for 30 seconds this is what it looks like after 30 seconds in stir it a little bit um and then put it in for another 30 seconds [Music] it looks a little bit better after another 30 seconds make sure to stir it until it's like really nice and like smooth um you can probably put it in for another 30 seconds after this and then let it um smooth it out like let the remaining heat melt the rest of the chocolate another well a minute 30 in the in total but 3 3 30 second intervals really smooth so like perfect stir until you feel like it's super nice and smooth like how it's looking right now and then start to pour one thing we almost forgot to do is put the canola oil in or the spam put it around spray the pan on the sides alright guys so now you need a paper towel to spread it around spread it around the wall maybe you don't put as much as you did all right and then the next step is to dump in the chocolate all right guys so now we're going to add the chocolate hopefully it doesn't slip i'm probably gonna use all this chocolate yeah we're gonna have a little i'm gonna have to do another thing of chocolate here for the next layer make sure you're getting as much chocolate out as possible so those things we gotta do you can kind of scrape it scrape it off so now we have to spread it around and we'll see once we're done so here's what it looks like here's the final product and yeah there's some on the sides hopefully um it'll turn out better than it looks we're kind of swinging this um but yeah now we have to let sit for 15 minutes just pop in the freezer and wait 15 minutes until it's done all right all right so now we have to add a cup of peanut butter so i'm just gonna add it in nope um we might have to do like a little bit more since we're making a lot a big thing of it we'll see when we're done alright so next up the ingredient that is next is two tablespoons of butter uh room temperature butter maybe we're just gonna put a little bit more all right guys so now you're gonna add um a a fourth of a cup and a tablespoon um you can add more or less depending on what type of chocolate you use it's just to sweeten it up we use milk chocolate so we're not going to use a bunch so yeah let's stir it all right so now we're going to mix it with the ham mixture so uh here we go three two one all right so i'm going with the peanut butter and the chocolate is done cooling it actually looks pretty nice um but uh yeah now we're gonna dump the chocolate into here oh that's definitely enough i think it's like the perfect amount all right so now we're gonna add some more chocolate and put in the microwave so here we go all right so now for the final step what we have to do is we have to take the rest of this chocolate and dump it in here so i'm just gonna try like this wow oh my gosh whoa that is satisfying all right so we have finally finished and all we have to do now is plop it in the freezer and wait about 20 minutes until it's done and then we can try this baby out all right so we're about to put in the freezer for the second time for another 20 minutes and yeah it's been 20 minutes guys it's finally done it's pretty heavy actually uh we'll see upstairs wow look at that beautiful nice swirly all right so it all comes down to this moment in about two hours and two more minutes in the making so it all comes down to this one flip oh here we go i know how to do this [Music] oh is it not coming out all right so we have just cut it and now we're going to oh crap the bottom kind of is sticking still oh we have half of a piece i guess that'll be the best you'll have to do yeah the bottom is kind of sticking all right guys so it is done finally um there's some technical difficulties but in the end they came out pretty nice um let's dig in it's kind of difficult to get into it [Music] that's really good wow that's way better than i expected oh my gosh that's a milk that's gonna wrap up the video guys hopefully you guys enjoyed make sure to like subscribe to our panther and we'll see you the next one peace [Music]", "qvyurtBFNM4": "hey everybody just a real quick video because i've got some

more expensive vegetables you know I'll pay two three dollars for a head of broccoli you know it's the same as the United States the United Sates expensive too it's like on the same ballpark three dollars per head of properly whereas bananas I mean a very good deal the United States you can find up to them I don't know seven bananas for a doll or something like that Trader Joe's does five you but you can get even better than that here it's double acai twenty but has well fifteen if you buy a lot there's so messy that big shout out to and nikka kado avocado I don't know it's a girl or boy they have a Twitter and they tweeted me to do this i won thank you Nick cacao avocado fan fan account for always retweeting everything I have tweet and liking it up and all that stuff mmm oh my gosh so I have eight here eight how are you into I wanted other reasons it's raining today oh so you saw the beginning I think yes Martha the rains coming down actually actually just stop once I turn the camera on and I was upstairs with mr. noodle and Roberto in there and their palace I call it a palace it's like a little bird Palace I have a lot of room oh yeah a great combination anyways they were talking to the rain a minute it's like this Oh mmm-hmm I love leashes for month oh oh yeah by the way please defend me in the conference oh my gosh she's seeing such fun healthy food well this is my first time having a Reese's for probably two or three years I am in tell you the last time I've had a Reese's was my first time having ice cream sandwiches since college college that was two thousand eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen seven years ago and nip ricotta avocado tweeted me I read all your tweets by the way just like I read all the comments it was like please do and ice cream sandwich I was like okay okay I got you covered today sometimes it focus as well sometimes it does it all look at this explosion oh gosh I'm happy yeah I feel really happy today I'm gonna call me I think because of the rain rain makes you calm especially where I live the sounds of the reign of are really nice little the sounds of the rate of are very very nice you guys you hear it very like if it was raining at nighttime I don't have to use my white noise machine you guys know I'm a very picky sleeper I I mask I've earplugs I have a mouth mouth guard I have a fan I'm to have a white noise has to be cool I'm very picky it's hot here so we have a family of us of well I use a white noise on my phone there's this a pile of oh there's an a pile of that actually use relaxing melodies I actually I found it two years ago I stirred using it and I just put on the rain white ways by it I love it when it's really raining outside at nighttime it's the best white noise ever this should almost be a challenge because the challenge is to eat them before they fall apart you know let's do this one here oh look at this melting mmm oh yeah I'll break it up for you guys - it doesn't really tear well there's no messy but I love it oh I think the last time I've had ice cream was in Bangkok Thailand hey I usually went to this restaurant where they have the world's largest ice cream sundae I mean or the basically ate half of it it was did we yeah pretty much I found that for you guys in a much moment and around that time all you guys were telling me please do more sweets I'm not a huge sweet person like if I'm hungry I want peso noodles cheese but since I eat sweet stuff so sparingly it's very nice way I do have it you know mm-hmm I've had four pcs already and I love the way they smell they make me think of Halloween you know when you do things over and over it becomes less exciting like if you live by the beach the beach is less exciting and if you take a special except there once a year I lived in Florida people thought else out the beach all the time and I was like no mm Oh super hyper hyper sweet strawberry oh I think I like the video Lamar yeah that was just like very intense sweetness I like the subtle so I'm not a big sugar person anyways was I saying oh this is making me think of Halloween time I'm licking my fingers like crazy I'm so sorry oh I would go trick-or-treating with my family and then after it's rehearse reading maybe it out for I don't know an hour maybe an hour and a half I don't even know I was it came back to so my perception of time was very off there for long adults it still is well I remember we come back and me and my sisters everyone would dump their Halloween bucket full of candy onto the table and my parents would sit down with us for another hour or however long I took and go through the candy one by one individually because you know when it's night time you don't really see what people are putting it you just open your bag and they put something in there sometimes you get a hand select but even that it's kind of it's hard to see if they have a porch light on or whatever the house saw spooky if their decorations you don't know what people are giving you and so my parents would sit down and we'll go through each individual can do to make sure that it wasn't open injected with something you know it's a scary world there's sick of people to get pleasure out of seeing others suffer it's like those crazy those disgusting channels on YouTube that literally make they profit off of other people's suffering discussing just just there's some very vile human beings in this world they get this sick pleasure out of watching and other people have a bad day and talking about it and making it even worse yeah um my favorite candy was always Reese's receipts as it reasons or Reese's I think it's Reese's I don't even know I just eat it look at this this has nothing no we're gonna do could you make a Reese's sandwich this is so insane I can't believe these are melting a store look if you want to join me and goes like no oh wow actually when we talked about last night I said let's do it together people like to see us too much focus together people excuse me get sick of me or leave me to change that's when these pickles came in but everyone seems to hate this place so I got to do mrs. pickles in private so we're gonna do this together and then do this when he's like no I'd rather stick to my diet you can do it I was like but I bought all these so that's one of the reasons why there's more we were both gonna be here and here it is mmm it's like a peanut butter milk shake haha so good I should put morning very messy should I do dad let people be surprised and maybe half my eating shows are messy anyways but not like this this is like oh my god this is so good look at this tell me you guys are jealous they're gonna watch me eat all this sweet stuff making me think of Halloween like I said how is my favorite holiday growing up cuz I loved witches I love scary movies I love suspense I love mystery Halloween is also very nice whether it's fall the leaves are crunching beneath your feet as you walk down the sidewalk it's crisp it's cool all the nice style my favorite styles scarves jeans builds but not like snow boots like pants like nice pants stylish boots that's Halloween time that was always my favorite time of year okay these are getting so melty it's not supposed to do that okay so these two I bet by the time I get to them they're going to be unedible know what I should do I can eat them later let me put them into the wrappers I'll be right back I'm gonna put these into the wrappers put it back into the freezer so you can eat it tomorrow or the next day because they aren't falling apart I'll finish this one I'll be right back I'm back home I got a spoon because as you can see oh it's so good though and a little can ice cream says it tastes like vanilla of course but the texture is different than other cut ice creams I've had before it's very fluffy it's like if as if they would mix ice cream with whipping cream whipped whipped cream whipped cream I know it's crazy my whole life I grew up saying whipped cream 1 whi peed whipped cream and then I got to the ripe old age 15 I looked at the box of like wit bean  who says whipping cream and then the container says whipped cream whipped cream but you know sometimes you speak so fast that the the ends of the words just get chopped off that's why sometimes it's really hard to learn language depending on who's speaking if they're speaking fast there's a slang Oh how many guys sent whipped cream ice cream with I'll have ice cream with cherries on top with whipped cream note says ice cream on top with whipped quipped cream or a whippin green crazy don't worry he'll ah so I don't think I'm really there you go it's not that hard delicious oh my here wild parrots those are the corn parrots that's what they call them the corn the farmers hate them they need everything not bad not bad I would have one more yeah oh it's okay so I bought to get married and I was like oral and I'm gonna save them for a future for a month mom he's like yeah I don't like them okay even if you like them you know he can be wait once but he told me I don't like pcs I don't like peanut butter chocolate together so say okay these have sat in here for a few months now May June July August like four months five months and I was like okay today's the day I mean I'm like there's three luck today how's it or that he's like yeah I made even before my diet I was like oh okay surprise that's okay but I have this one chocolate spray I mean this stop spilling I mean I feel full this was a I mean you're supposed to eat one maybe two I ate six eight six ice-cream sandwiches I even realized it just flew by look at this well that's really fun and then all my lips or teeth no hmm I'm pretty mindful about that sometimes I'm editing a video and I'll see that there's something in the corner of my mouth or there's a little drop of ketchup right here mustard over here and it stays on for minutes I'm looking at the screen saying wipe your mouth ah I can't imagine what you guys feel watching and I think probably ruins the experience that's that's what makes this hard - yeah I mean yes I'm eating but I also eat like a normal human being I'm not like oh let's cut it with a knife and you know I just you shove it in if I was eating popcorn I take a fistful you know I know you'll be like piece by piece most real-life human beings don't eat in a way that's photogenic that's aesthetically pleasing but I'm making my job out of eating for you guys so I'm torn between just being real because I feel like people enjoy watching real people at the other day I don't like watching half these YouTube channels they're out there that are just stories or edited every like five seconds to jump-jump-jump cup junk up you only seen them smile I mean yes that brings people happiness no no doubt but if you if you film daily it's gonna get a point where you can't keep being a character you know like some youtubers that I really enjoy I've never seen them sad or cry like oh can I can I press that button just to see some waterworks please maybe that's just me but anyways with the whole eating thing it's not I'm not doing jump cuts and like having a perfect presentation while eating I'm just eating like a normal being a human being right so that's interesting it's interesting I get comments all the time why you're so disgusting comments all the time saying well you make it look so delicious I'm hungry now so I really depends on the person at the other day anyways this was a very short mukbang I didn't do much talking in the beginning I think when they have film to today you guys so I want to tell you I mean I am staying up all night tonight I got on a bed at 1:00 p.m. it's now 4:30 I had a breakfast but this was likely a big you know guys have been tell you I mean to have one big meal today yesterday was six Big Macs but I was out on my bike for an hour and a half today I had green juice I sweated out a lot of sodium so my eyes aren't as puffy this morning I woke up like this so sometimes in my mouth bugs if I wet my double chin is like really massive it means uh you know maybe get exercise yet or there's still some sodium buildup in his blood can't speak for everyone that's just a personal that's my indication of yeah what do we touch it in so I have been in a very bad schedule in terms of sleeping and in terms of being alive right so I got the flu the moment I got back from Canada which is a month and a half ago it seems like yesterday those there a month and half ago came back from Canada called the flu I really thought I was dying from diabetes kidney failure and then I was if doctors got blood work everything's fine by the way if you haven't seen that video yet please check it out I want all my subscribers to watch that so they just on the same page and they can hear what I have to say that healthy that I'm okay especially now that I'm back in my routine I'll stop there you can watch the video to get all the details and all the drama about what what happened to me what else I say oh so I got the flu so my sleeping was really my eating was off everything was off so I would be waking up at like 2 p.m. but then I won't get tired till 2 a.m. and then I'm having dinner at midnight and this has been I've been trying so hard to get out a cycle if you've seen my tweets I'm like guys help me what should I do well I'm still working on it so today I'm like I put my foot down said that's it I'm just not gonna sleep tonight I'm not gonna sleep so that tomorrow I can have breakfast at like 7:00 a.m. lunch at 11 or 12 do my mukbang get like 11 that's what I have always done like 11 a.m. like right in the middle the day and I got my dinner for I love an early dinner so that by 7:00 8:00 I'm winding down it's great I love that I feel so much healthier that way even if I'm eating unhealthy foods well that doesn't count for proper sleep proper hydration I drink a gallon of water every day I exercise I'm eating fiber I'm doing green juice it's like I'm making sure it's fine but it's been really difficult ever since I got sick so it's been a month and a half of not sleeping right and waking up so late I mean I I sleep okay I'm dead like a rock when I'm out but if I you know with the white noise in the air masking everything but uh I I always feel more refreshed if I go asleep before 9 p.m. rather than after 9 a.m. even if I sleep for the same duration there's something about it that happens to the human body melatonin production is natural that happens when the Sun Goes Down I feel like deep sleep happens better with the stars in the Sun I don't know how exploit it I'm not a scientist but I'm just saying that's how I feel so anyways I'm gonna film a second look bug today this was very short not much talking except for now I'm gonna film a second deal for you guys and I'm gonna do it at like 11:00 p.m. and we step in to edit both to keep myself awake I'm also gonna go in Yunel for the first time in a long time to chat with you guys and your guys are gonna help me stay awake and we're gonna have fun so well you're

is fudge of fun swim and today i have a new planet to reveal it is marshmallow top reese's peanut butter cups and they are super delicious thanks for watching don't forget to like subscribe and comment goodbye", "A-ATSlDEW-s": "hey guys so today i'm going to be making tiny food i'm going to be making some peanut butter cups but in tiny version so i'm basically going to use these molds i made of my pinky finger and use them to put the chocolate and the peanut butter the only exception to the mini part is that i use the microwave in a big bowl for the chocolate but i feel like transferring it to that bowl this bowl will just take time i don't want it tartan so we're going to start just going to take our little mold make sure when you make them press the bottom like this or on the table so that it can sit up mostly and then just put in some chocolate i don't want it to like cover it all the sides edges and fill part at the bottom all right i just ran out to the fridge i'm gonna do it every time i make one of these you know what this one's just a little bit too long okay that's better shoot okay trying to work fast the chocolate does not melt or not melt uh harden so just just gonna fill it up and move it around the edges just so that it keeps the peanut butter in there but also so that the bottom is a little bit full okay i'll put that in the fridge next one a little taste test i can feel it hardening this is bad all right okay last one oh wait now there's one more after this never mind okay so we're just gonna swirl it around so that hoof inside is covered and last one for real i'm just using some milk chocolate chips for the chocolate but you can use dark chocolate or really any chocolate that you like unfortunately for this i don't have measurements i would just say a barbie spoonful or just however much you think your pinky might be bigger smaller than mine or you could just use like a straw even for your mold all right i'm gonna look at the first one i put in the fridge to see if it's hardened it has successfully hardened and stick my finger in and oh might have needed a little bit more time but it's okay so now we're going to take some peanut butter i would use creamy definitely not because i like that one better just because chunky might not be good for this especially because it's mini okay so now we're just gonna set this over here i actually think this was the first one i did but that's okay i'm just gonna fill it with peanut butter too it's hard to get the spoon in there and just kind of try and shove it down as far as you can so you have room to put the chocolate on top and i'm making these for myself or family so it's okay if i lick the spoon in between every single time this is the one i'm most excited about it just looks the longest i guess i don't know it's the deepest so i can really shove it full of peanut butter i might need some more peanut butter in this tiny bowl okay last two i think all right yeah i might need some more peanut butter on this tiny bowl actually i might have just enough this one's an awkward shape it's like a taco that's okay last one okay and because they're so small they only need a little tiny bit of time in the fridge but you can make this in big form with cupcake liners um it just may take longer to cool so for my chocolate i'm going to put in another microwave for about five seconds 10 seconds so when you put in the peanut butter you don't need to refrigerate it it won't really do anything to the peanut butter because it's not melted okay good good good now we need to take the chocolate and we'll use this one just here why don't i put this so you can see that and we're just going to take it and glob it over top maybe don't use that much so it covers and then put it on my miniature baking pan shoot i dropped the spoon all the way in there also if you're using a small spoon and you want to put it in your mouth to lick it be careful so you don't swallow it okay just gonna add the chocolate on the next one now where i'm getting all this miniature stuff um part of it is the total from the totally tiny set i got yesterday that i showed you guys yesterday and the other part of it is just random doll barbie stuff i've had for a while and also make sure you wash this with like dish soap and water i probably should have said this at the beginning but make sure you do that i did before i turned on the camera just so it's clean especially if it's been like in a bin full of doll accessories or something like that okay now i'm gonna stop these in the fridge for a minute to harden okay so this is the totally tiny glass bowl actually that's the only totally tiny thing um these little things which i didn't use this which i didn't use and this which i didn't use uh oh and this i did use are just barbie stuff i was originally gonna make something else but i would need like heat like candle or something i couldn't use the microwave so i figured something you don't have to like bake um well tomorrow i'm thinking i might do another mini food series or i think i might start a mini food series um and just make mini food it's fun so tomorrow i might try something different maybe tiny whipped cream i would have to use that little blender i'm curious to see if you could really whip something not look not like a blender like a mixer could i think i'll do that the other tiny foods i might have measurements but for this just a glob that's hard to really measure alright i'm gonna go grab the stuff out of the fridge okay so they're not ready yet but um i could make like real versions of these maybe we'll do that maybe tomorrow i'll make like a big version i don't know yeah i think i'm gonna stick to the mini it's more fun but tomorrow maybe i'll do i'm trying to make tiny whipped cream see if that blender could really whip something i have to press the button a lot of times because you have to press the button every time it goes the the blades spin i know it's kind of late for when i do my videos but i was hanging out outside okay it shouldn't be ready now they are ready all right so now i'm just going to think i camera or my phone and unpeel them so basically i'm just going to and take off the foil from remove the foil from them they're not all going to be great but i'm hoping they look pretty good okay so this one's not so bad um and taste it there's a very small amount of peanut butter in that it's mostly chocolate well they also stick to the wrapper a little bit not too bad though let's try this guy it seems a little more solid okay so oh this one seems better this one seems a little less so this one seems a little bit better maybe not i'm just crushing it no they're not they're just crushing in my hands i had to eat it all right so maybe i'll pop these in the fridge for another minute so the last two i just did kind of crushed in my hands um so i'm hoping the other ones actually come out okay i did actually do this before i made the video i tested and it worked fine maybe they just need more time but um yeah i think tomorrow i'll make the whipped cream and i'll try and get you guys some measurements so you can hopefully repeat it if you have a tiny mixer okay because i'm impatient let's go look if they're ready so i'm down to the last three i really want them to work so i'm going to be extra delicate and careful when doing them okay just trying to unpeel them carefully carefully oh i think it's working i think it's working i have to unpeel it never so gently unput okay so the side of it is a little bit melty so we're gonna put it on the plate and put it in if just set it to the side so it can hopefully harden a bit more and we'll look at this one okay this one looks good no it doesn't okay hopefully i can still make this work i just don't want to touch the actual thing because i'm going to crush it my fingers okay so it's good i don't know where to put it it's gonna put up my finger so it looks pretty good uh where do i set this okay right there i don't have anywhere else to put it so that one worked pretty good actually i could put it on a napkin here there someone worked pretty good um let's take a look back at this guy i'm just gonna have to do it okay he worked pretty good now the moment i have been waiting for this is the one i want to work so bad let's hope it works so so far i know i've said this in everyone but for real he actually looks very hardened this one i don't know why i'm calling him this one actually looks very much hardened is it it's always the side it's always the side the side is always the hardest part oh wow that looks good okay so i'm gonna set these all back on the pan and we're gonna put them so you can see them there we go we made some awesome tiny oh no reese's peanut butter cups i hope you guys try this i will see you tomorrow with my tiny whipped cream bye guys", "tPd0Pypo17A": "what's up teach every little bastards it's fun size review time honey roasted Reese's Cups once again Hershey's producing candies inspired by different taste small around the country just ones representing G a the flavor of Georgia is honey roasted and yeah I'm pumping cuz it's a Reese's Cup here we go guys it's a little melted but tastes just fine there's a strong honey flavor very strong you know what though I was afraid that's gonna happen you guys know I like sweet and salty stuff but I prefer more salty than sweet the honey in this Cup makes it a little bit too sweet and typically I give Reese's Cups ten out of ten I got to drop this down to a nine out of ten sorry guys it's just not perfect to me your mileage will vary greatly I'm sure", "JAn9ekBYB1Y": "[Music] [Music] you", "kk64Eu5AlYs": "good morning you chubby little bastards it's fun sighs view time the Reese's peanut butter cake donut from 7-eleven so we got a cake doughnut peanutbutter icing Reese's peanut butter cups and a chocolate drizzle all part of a balanced breakfast let's see how it tastes I'm gonna be real with you guys I would eat a piece of dry Roland if it had this Reese's Peanut Butter Cup topping but underneath that is the typical 7-eleven cake doughnut and that's not a good do you mind and that's not a good thing it's a little too dense it's very dry and while the topping itself the icing the recipient cups the drizzle is delicious the doughnut is not very good so if you're like me and you bought this pretty much just for the topping you won't be disappointed but as a doughnut it doesn't score very well I'm giving this one a 6 out of 10", "F0ByPbzjtBY": "[Music] hello my small fat adaptive family and welcome back to is it worth it the series where I get kita friendly foods or gadgets and I review them from the point of view of someone that has been in ketosis for over five years today we are looking at a slim fast product slim fast is a replacement meal company that is well known for its high carb shakes and its high carb bars however quite a while back in the USA they released a ketogenic category that's sort of getting bigger and bigger as time goes on and as a brief it's been really really hard for me to get a hold of these but I finally done it I'm only looking at one product from the keto category of the slim Fast Company and that is the product the kind of kickstart at this whole keto section for them and that is the slim fast keto peanut butter cup fat bombs does it really have the stats to be considered a fat bomb in terms of macronutrients per peanut butter cup you are looking at 90 calories 8 grams of fat 2 grams of protein and 6 grams of total carbs but two of those grams are a rifra tall and 3 grams of dietary fiber so the net carb count is one gram per peanut butter cup most people define fat bombs by their ingredients and the fact that the macronutrients will be made up of 90% fat macros wise yeah I would consider them a fat one so now let's look at the ingredients they have a milk chocolate coating which consists of chocolate erythritol cocoa butter whole milk powder inulin nonfat dry milk soy lecithin vanilla extract salt and stevia leaf extract then there's an MCT oil blend which is palm oil palm kernel oil and coconut oil then there's peanut butter of reference milk protein isolate peanut flour peanut oil stevia leaf extract and salt and as always I will talk about this expensive list of ingredients in my pros and cons in a little bit but first let's talk about the taste and the texture of these cups the chocolate looks lovely and glossy they are even and shaped a very similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so far so good getting into the cup was a disappointment I was expecting it to sort of have a soft rip like every other peanut butter cup I've ever tried keto or not but it wasn't I had to bite to snap a thing in a fist to look in the middle and the middle did not look like thick tasty peanut butter somebody commented on my last review requests and they said slim fast keto PP cups are very bland and tasteless save your time and money and well they're not far off the chocolate itself was like that really dirt cheap chocolate that you get in an advent calendar it was overly sweet and had a really cheap taste to it that left they really artificial aftertaste in your mouth and the peanut butter was anything but peanut butter I actually don't think the innards were sweet enough but I think this is because of how overpoweringly sweet the chocolate itself was it didn't taste like peanut butter and I can't really tell you what it tasted like because the flavor just wasn't strong enough to compare it to anything if anything it reminded me of coffee rebels sort of the texture of coffee rebels that and I think it's like prolly in the middle of praline chocolate that sort of texture it wasn't a peanut butter cup as we all know and love it so now let's talk about the pros and the cons starting with the pros by macro count these are 89% of fat and the protein is low at 2 grams and the net carbs I would consider true because these sweeteners they're using are sweeteners that have a low glycemic index so they're not going to spike your blood sugars so the macros on these are good and the other Pro is the convenience you know that kind of food that you just drop into a bag and it's easy to unwrap and eat wherever you are I now want to talk about the Pro / cons which can be either all kind of depending on who you are the ingredients are in the / / cons today because there are some good ones and some not-so-good ones the sweeteners are surprisingly good a RRIF throw toe has a glycemic index between 1 and 3 in Ulan has a glycemic index of 1 and stevia leaf extract has a glycemic index of zero so like I said all true good sweeteners that will not spike your blood Sugar's to be honest I don't really have a problem with the chocolate or any of the milk products that they've used because whilst they are yes slightly higher carb ingredients they're obviously not using enough to spike the carb count now I don't like the sheer list of ingredients but my problem lies with three ingredients that is palm oil and the palm kernel oil and the peanut oil my issue with the palm oils is nothing to actually do with digestion or or health or anything like that my issue is the fact that we don't know whether the oil is sustainable and if it's not sustainable palm oil is often produced in a way that devastates rainforests and its wildlife and my problem with the peanut oil is health-related when things are cooked with peanut oil it generates oxidized lipids which are molecules that are known to cause heart disease and by consuming peanut oil you are consuming linoleic acid which is a poly unsaturated fatty acid that is known to spike your omega-6 omega-3 ratio and high omega-6 will cause things like inflammation and other symptoms that we literally lower with keto so what is the point in doing keto if you're just going to have these snacks that reverse the benefits of it finally in the Pro / cons is the price if you live in America you're looking at about $10 for 14 cups so that works out to 71 cents per cup which seems absolutely fine however as a Brit it cost me 13 pounds not including posting and packaging for 14 that works out to 1 pound 7 a cup Americans that is $1 32 cents for that piddly little thing it's just ridiculous which brings us into the Cotton's the keto section of slimfast is mainly in the United States of America and Canada so if you're outside of those two places you will find it a lot harder to get ahold of these products and you're looking at a much higher price when you do find it in these special online diet stores the size is a con I was expecting something a little bit bigger it is it is literally bite size another con is that these are not filling enough a fat bomb is filling but because these are overly sweet and they taste cheap they just leave you wanting more and more of them which is the complete opposite purpose of a fat bomb I've already spoken about the taste and the texture there absolutely a corn I don't have anything else to say on them so slim fasts keto peanut butter cup fat bombs are they worth it no they're not worth it you are paying for a commercial product that does not appear to be made with the intention to help quito folk out of the good of their hearts and the reason i say this is because if you look right on the packaging it says text keto plan 2 4 4 2 2 2 for a free 7 day meal planner and that planner implies that you have to buy their other keto products they might have the right intention but I I just I don't personally believe it it is not worth buying something that is this expensive for a cheap artificial taste and a bit of a weird texture with a huge huge number of ingredients in there it's a gimmick and I beg you not to fall for it but with that being said that is all for this video
