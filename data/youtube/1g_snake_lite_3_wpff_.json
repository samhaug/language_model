{"c2zn8hrEVdo": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome back to another live stream getting ready to get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it

the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get

forty-five percent of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all

won so everybody go ahead put in your final answer delete all your other answers that you may have put in when i'm done taking this dab we're gonna see who won", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "6R7zVe4XPeY": "What up Cannabis Growers, and welcome back\nfor another lit episode of GreenBox Grown! \u00a0Now and today's video I'm going to be doing\na product review, and the product I am reviewing is this wifi-enabled digital trichome scope. Now this product makes looking at your trichomes\na million times easier when compared to your traditional jewelers loop or non digital trichomes\ngo. And the reason being is because of this thing\nactually syncs up with your smartphone via its own app that you can download from the\nApp Store, and what it does is allows you to record while simultaneously seeing what\nyou're looking at with the scope. So afterwards you can we watch that video\nto see exactly where your trichomes are in terms of development and then of course you\ncan play it in slo-mo so it is easier to see them then during that live feed. So in today's video I'm going to show you\nguys exactly what comes with this product and its packaging and then I'm also going\nto do a little demonstration where I show you guys how to use the scope while demonstrating\non my Gorilla Glue Autoflower plants that I am currently growing for my Stealth Grow\nSeries. Now for those of you interested and picking\nup this trichome scope, I do have a link to it on Amazon and that link is also right here\non your screen and I will also have it listed Down Below in the description of this video. All right so now. That you guys know what we are doing in today's\nvideo, let's get started with that overview of the supplies that come with this trichome\nscope in the packaging. Okay so here we are with the packaging and\nall of the supplies that came with it, again I think this was around 40 or $45 for the\nscope. And what it came with was of course it's charging\ncable which is a USB cable so I just use my butt from my smartphone charger for that. And then I plug it into the wall. Now it also comes with this cool stand for\nif you want to position it while looking at a sample on your table or if you just want\nto put it like that while it's charging it's pretty nice. And then of course it comes off of there and\nyou have the trichome scope itself. The scope does come with a desk cover that\nClips over the edge there but since we are about to use it, I have removed it already. It is just a piece of clear plastic that Clips\nonto the end. Now you will see that it has the power button\nright here and you just hold that down to turn this on and then once that light comes\non that means it's powered up. This dial right here with the LED right underneath,\njust controls how bright the LED at the end there, that light or LED light is at the very\nend of the scope. So you can see like that is all the way up\nand then there it is off. So that is nice to have, it's a nice feature\nand then you also have this button right here. Which is actually these two buttons to zoom\nin and zoom out, and that is for once you have synced up to the app and you've got your\nlive feed going you can use this if you want to zoom in at a little bit of a time. Or you can use this dial for adjusting the\nscope so it goes from 50x to 1000 x once you have the dial all the way to the left that's\nfully zoomed in and then all the way to the right is zoomed out. So let me turn it off real quick so I need\nto get set up first before we use it. But that is pretty much everything that comes\nwith. \u00a0The cool features that it is wifi-enabled\nso you can sync it up with your smart phone and just watch what you are doing through\nthe screen of your phone. Or you can take pictures like I was saying\nyou can take videos which is what I'll be doing here in a second. So if you are the gorilla glue autoflowers\nfor my grow series and this is what we will be looking at up close for their trichomes. So let me just give you guys a little look\nup close at the buds, they're looking really Frosty and they are about a week to two weeks\naway, I would say about a week and a half away from being ready for their flush. So they are getting pretty close here and\nlooking like a nice yield for autoflowers. And I think this exhale CO2 bag has a lot\nto do with that. So let me get the scope setup and hooked up\nto the smartphone and then I will be back to show you guys those close-ups. Alright so we have a quick look at the buds\nwe are going to be looking at with the scope. That's the Gorilla Glue Autoflower, And these\ngenerics come from Growers Choice seeds. So let me give you guys a good little zoom\nin on these guys. Looking pretty good and getting close to being\nready like I was saying, all right so can you to using this scope or any scope really\nis you need to have obviously a really Steady Hand. So what is nice as this has a nice extension\nfrom the lens so you can get that nice you can push it up against the bud decently to\nhelp stabilize it and that way you don't get all that sticky resin on the lens of the scope. So here we go, we are actually zoomed in all\nthe way right now on the scope so let me zoom out and start with the zoomed out shot for\nyou guys. Okay so we can see a decent shot right there,\nand looking pretty milky with some clear. I'll keep zooming in, that's a nice shot for\nyou guys, and yeah as you can see I can get it holding pretty steady if you get the fans\nturned off and that way there is no Breeze working against you. And then keep zooming in and we'll get a nice\nlook, look at that! You can see they're looking good, and yeah\na little too zoomed in right there so let me Zoom back out. Yeah you can see those trichomes and the little\nheads on top, pretty nice. And again this will be great for obviously\nchecking when they are ready for Harvest, these are not looking there just yet. It does look like we are looking at some trichomes\non a Sugar Leaf right here. So that is why they look some Amber there. And again those mature faster than the buds\nso want to make sure you are looking at trichomes on the buds to determine when they are ready. Alright hold on one more quick look for you\nguys here. \u00a0 Sugar Leaf, stem or something sticking out\nfrom an old fan leaf. Here is a pistol that we are looking up closely\non, so that is like those Pistols that start off white sticking straight up and then they\ncrow in an orange slightly. And then there are some trichomes off in the\ndistance a little bit for you. Alright so here's a nice last look for you\nguys, nice and up close and then so yeah. These ones aren't fully developed on the sugar\nleaves here so we do have some time to go, but there is your guys demonstration with\nthe trichome scope! All right cannabis Growers of that concludes\ntoday's product review of this digital wifi-enabled trichome scope. And again I really like this especially when\ncompared to the traditional jewelers loop or your standard non-digital trichome scope. Just because of how easy it is to record and\nthen play back the video and just look at the trichomes at that point. And then you don't have to try and determine\nwhat stage of development they are at while looking at that live feed on your screen or\non the scope. Because it is going to be a little bit shaky\nwhen you first start using it until you get used to it. And then of course because you are looking\nat something that isn't sturdy you know on a table in front of you. As always thank you guys for watching today's\nvideo, I really hope you enjoyed it, and until next time\u2026 Happy Growing!!!", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's the big trip

loaded up here bottle textile the reason that we do that you can see the bottom how its folded in the two corners are inverted we reason we do that as it holds the proper surface area so we can get a consistent measurement every time so we know how much pressure to put on this thing so that's how it's measuring the touch of measuring the bottle textile via the surface area so if you don't fold it

"EeRJkuHnYXg": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow today is a great day it's feeding day welcome to my 2020 2021 winter growing season i'm growing cream caramel and orange sherbet cannabis plants today's uh the day where we feed them and in this video today you're going to be watching me make another batch of fox farm and a general organics nutrient mix for my ladies it happens to be wednesday march 17th 2021 and um i'm following the fox farm soil feeding schedule and that's basically what what we're sticking with here and let's see if i can get to it i will show you what we're going to do today i'm kind of following it but i also have to admit that i i've i'm adjusting it as i need you know and so we're still in the fourth week we got tomorrow is the last day of the fourth week but we're still in the fourth week so if we look at what we're gonna do today and i've already written it down we're gonna go with big bloom three teaspoon grow bigs two tiger bloom's got two we're gonna add them we're gonna this will be our first time adding binby to the mix that's a bud sweetener we're gonna do three of those three of the bimbi and then we're still gonna hit that cow make two two teaspoons of the cow mag and we're gonna hit that micro brew one more time half teaspoon uh and that's pretty much all we're gonna do we'll add all of those which is quite a bit but we'll add all of those and we'll check the ph level and adjust up because we're going to need to more than likely and then we'll get a measurement of the electrical conductivity and the parts per million p uh as well so if you look down here you can already see shit's in the way but you can see we've got i've already i've got all the numbers already put down three two two three two and a half these are so these are teaspoons these are milliliters and this is for three gallons in milliliters so did that first then got my jars together here so each one of them here so big bloom all of them have as you can see they all have their measurements pre labeled so it makes it really easy i'll use one of the pipettes for the microbe because it's only seven and a half milliliters and also a pipette for the ph up which is hiding in the back and you can't see it but that'll be the next thing so first off we'll get back here get my spot and uh we will do like we always do we'll start by adding water adding rain water this is rain water that i've collected and it's been sitting in the shed for a while and it's at room temperature and i'm not going to talk too much let's get through all this because we'll have plenty of time mixing ingredients one is done number two and lastly number three and yeah i'm i know a lot of people would say to add uh half newts now but i'm going to go ahead and stick with the fox farm schedule continue full newts and then going with the sledgehammer to flesh and see how that works for me so much for talk not talking huh all right good enough there's three the rainwater has been working extremely well i'm really proud of the fact that i was able to use it and it's working great so let's go ahead and get our [ __ ] started and i'll slide this over just a little bit like that we'll start with actually you know what we'll just leave it here i'll do it like this start with big bloom 45 milliliters all right one down now we're going to start the stirring game every time we stir okay first one done next it's the grow bag so we'll grab it of course we gotta shake it up and this is 30 milliliters okay stir it up again next is tiger bloom shake it up 30 milliliters in goes tiger bloom mixing them up three down three to go mix it as soon as i'm done with this i'll be uh putting the air bubbler on it as i always do and then uh feeding the plants i'm excited to use this bembe for the first time really excited to use it i say first time this grow when i say that 45 milliliter this has molasses in it a little bit a little bit of cane sugar and some other [ __ ] basically and uh i was in the back in the day or my previous grow i grow i just use straight molasses but this is actually supposed to be better for it because as i said it's got uh it doesn't it's got earthworm castings okay probably can't see it but earthworm castings guano so yeah it's got four percent fructose cane sugar and beet sugar and four percent glucose looks like they don't put molasses in this one huh you used to have my oh there it is yeah there is it's there anyway that's what we're using first time should make the buds sweeter tasting a little bit i don't know if that's really true but a lot of old timers go with with it so we're going with it here cow mag two more left cow mag is next shake it up sorry about the did not know my bell was on my ringer i like to keep that [ __ ] but on vibrate only but obviously i didn't do it properly cow mag the messy [ __ ] cow mag definitely messy cow mag is definitely one of the messier ones for sure and it don't help when you're clutch like me and you make and you spill it that don't help either i do not know what my deal is with the cow mag and why i always got to make a mess with it but here i am with it making a [ __ ] mess it's okay it is a mess though you guys probably i don't think you can see what i'm doing well off camera here but it's a mess it's okay [ __ ] it it'll be all right that's why you have paper towels all right last but not least microbe brew let's get some microbes in there stir that up this is gonna be seven and a half milliliters so grab this one ff which is now fox farm was flawless finish and we're gonna do 7.5 so we're going to go right up to there and this one we'll see if we can get it we'll do that there we go man this [ __ ] stinks i know i say that every time i use it but it does all right where are we at seven we're at eight seven five is right there a little bit more there we go and it goes microbes microbes and more microbes whatever the hell else is in there okay one more stir it's a hell of a concoction i'll tell you that where do you think we're going to be on ph 5.3 maybe probably we will find out here just a second i'm gonna clean off a little bit of this uh one though on the outside of this pipet it's it's a mess okay let's go ahead now and grab our forgot to do the parts ph before after and mount okay i wrote those down what do you think we're going to be we'll start off with the ph first and get in the [ __ ] way shake it off wipe it off blow it off and see where we're at 5.3 looks to be yup 5.3 it looks to be okay so we start with 5.3 now we need to think about what happened when we put those in last time and what what now i've actually got more in there than what i had last time but if we look at 5.3 here and we're putting in not everything not everything all right here we go that 5.1 we put in 12 milliliters to get to 6. so let's put in 10 milliliters and see where we're at because we do have more [ __ ] in there so we'll put 10 milliliters of ph up in and see what happens and hopefully i don't overdo it so we'll grab this put this over here zoom back out so you can see where we're at what we're at and what we're doing and 10's way up here i'm gonna go to here i don't know if you can even see that i can't tell yeah almost we're almost there that should do it now i did too much that's that is eight nine we'll put in nine see what that does so that is nine might need to add more don't know but stir it up nonetheless i want to be between 5.9 and 6.3 basically if i can get between those values i'll be all right let's see where we're at at nine shake it off wipe it off blow it out turn it on get back over here [Applause] so that's right telling me 5.7 this isn't enough that was nine at 5.7 so we'll write this down nine and uh we went up uh 0.4 we went at 0.4 and it was at 5.7 so if i do 0.4 that'll be 6.1 so if i do another 9 let's do 5 let's do 6 more mil let's do five more we'll do five more that'll be 14 milliliters there's five beautiful and stir it up i'll just leave the no i'll put the lid back on i know me i'm a clutch stir it up real good where are we at now hmm we were at five seven we just put in five more let's see where we're at five eight five nine basically so that was five nine let's back that out and do some more math let me bump it up a little bit more i may add just a few more that was 5.9 of course that's pretty good i could leave it there actually five eight five nine a little bit acidic i guess that that was five milliliters so that that was weird that went up uh three it's about right i guess so i think we'll just bump it up with another milliliter more milliliters and that'll give us uh 16 milliliters let's do two more there we go and two's down here there's two right there that's gonna be it it's gonna be definitely within my range now we're gonna call it so that's two more so that's a total of what did i say uh seven and nine sixteen milliliters so we'll write down 16. and what do y'all think here let's stir it up what do you think's gonna be okay let's see we're at five nine i'll just put in two more milliliters i'm thinking six one six two it's actually five 8 and change really if you want to get technical about it but it was i rounded up but let's see where we're at yeah just bumped it up a little bit which is fine i'll get to six almost 5.95 really is 5.95 oh should i go a little bit more didn't really go up much did it that too it went up a little bit let's do uh [ __ ] it let's do two more let's do two more that bambi's throwing me off for sure all right we need to get back to here almost there don't overdo it there's two more and we are i am done i really am done i don't give a damn i know i said that before but i really am now done no more if it ain't it ain't it but it's gonna be it because i'm really in the range already so i'm just bumping it up a little bit more which hopefully uh didn't go crazy on me at the last second shouldn't have though okay wipe her off now we should be i'm gonna say i'm gonna say six actually that's the plan it's gonna be six turn it on stick it in shake it around zoom up look at that [ __ ] dead nut six all right perfect so we did 18 come down here it's a mess we did 18 so i just added two more and we're at 6.0 from 5.3 now time for the ec and parts per million shut that off put that back in back to here let's grab this ec meter now shake it off blow it out turn it on clear it because it's got a clearer this is going to be parts per million first so we'll go ahead and stick it in there and let it set and it's flashing 1643. is the ppm and what's it going to be three probably 3.5 3.5 wow good deal very happy with that off and back in the solution it goes okay so we have done it we have made another batch of fox farm and general organics uh some nutrient solution mix and we have ph upped it with general hyponics ph up base solution so what we put in we put in 45 milliliters of big bloom we put in 30. go down here one more time 30 milliliters of grow big 30 milliliters of tiger bloom 45 millimeters millimeters milliliters damn it milliliters of beembee if i've been saying millimeters is not it's milliliters uh 30 milliliters of cal mag and micro brew is 7.5 milliliters so we started off at a at 3.5 sorry we started off at 5.3 we put in 18 we got to 6.0 the ec is 3.5 and the ppm is 1643. and you know what comes next bubbler but i can't leave it in for real real long because it foams up with this uh micro brew in it but we'll put that in next get a little air flow in it and get some oxygen infused a little bit more oxygen infused and we will go from there so let's put it in get that in real quick i just put in one for now because it see how it bubbles how it foams up i should say may not foam up as bad as i thought ah let's put both in help with it let's try it okay they're both going beautiful let that sit for 15 minutes or so bubbling away if you get that oxygen infused into it uh and then we're gonna start feeding three bottles or three pints per plant two and a half pints bottom half pint on top and that's the way we roll anyway thank you so much for coming to my channel and watching my videos please like subscribe click the bell share my videos with your friends post a comment below that would be awesome i really enjoy having everyone come back i want this to be a community where we all learn from each other and grow and if i can teach you something today i'm happy to do it if i can at least entertain you then i'm happy to do that i really do appreciate you coming by and watching my videos with all those [ __ ] out there that's posting right now everybody's posting a video about it thank you for being here i do appreciate it i'll see you all on the next video and as i always say happy smoking", "xlnARC0CGB0": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow welcome to my 20 20 20 21 winter growing season today is saturday march what is today march 13th my ladies are in their fourth week of the growing season and it's flowering season for them firing stage of the growing season i'm medicated sorry guys basically they're in their fourth week uh third day fourth week of their flowering stage and they need to be flushed they've been fed three times and they needed to be flushed so in today's video i told you in the last video i wasn't going to show you but [ __ ] it i'll show you if i can figure i can maybe show you without showing you the actual plants themselves then we gotta figure it out uh i'll show you how i feed again and uh watch the ladies drink because they're ready trust me the leaves are saggy sagging whatever you want to call it so it's time to do something and feed so when i come back we're going to start the feeding process or the flushing actually with three pints of of sledgehammer flesh per potted plant and that's a three gallon potted plant in a fabric pot we'll be right back this is a cannabis reviewer all right we are back this is the cannabis reviewer we got him pushed down we're on the scrog side and both have creeped caramels with the fox farm ocean forest in them and as you can see that they're dry now but we're about to feed them so uh what we'll actually do is i will zoom in real quick and we'll start with the first one here on the left and uh go from there so let me get my [ __ ] together and we'll start oh i should show you first too hold on let me show you okay i'm back up here i'm going to be using this container here all right let me zip back up a little the other way there i'm going to be using one of these to fill up one of these and you'll see me pour two of those in two and two and a quarter of those in there and then we'll do another uh three quarters up on top so let's get this started without further ado let's get this started go ahead and zoom down onto that this is where we always start first music you hear in the background that is the music i'm playing for my ladies and it's a bunch of different stuff uh music and sounds crickets and just different frequencies okay number one watch how she sucks it right up she just drinks it right up this is a ph balance to 5.9 you can go watch my previous video you can see me making it i did have a little bit of foaming issue to deal with so i had to cut off the air bubbler this is number two now we're going to do a quarter of it and then three quarters of it will go on top i would uh say i would recommend though when you do decide to air bubble this don't do it for very real long time because it will foam up like a beer and that can be an issue but you do want to do it a little bit all right now we're going to do a quarter of the of it in here almost i don't know if you can see that or not because i am way up here but i think you can so now we're going to do the top suck that down that's something there we go now we'll do the top and at first you just put a little bit around it because you need it to start to soak in you don't want it to run off this to the side you don't want it to run off to the side and drop down you want it to soak down through so you give it a little time for it to break the surface tension and bring that down so it'll allow it to absorb into the moisture once it gets that first soil tension go moisture once the soil tension gets broke from the first time it will do a better job of just dropping right on down into uh the soil and dropping through it seems to be working and doing a good job this way uh nothing seems to be having any problems give a little bit of time let that let that liquid soak down i don't know if you can see the liquid soaking down through the soil or not because i'm here watering it can't see what's on the screen but hopefully you can see it hopefully you're not seeing my ugly mug just but yeah that's what we do let's put it in there all right number one is done that's how you do number one so same thing for number two now and uh you just rinse and repeat basically see look at that i already drank it up i already drank it up these aren't movable because they're scrogged so these have to stay where they're at the others are movable and i would i actually rotate those with the uh every few every few days every time i feed them they get rotated or if i decide to trim them they get rotated and it helps because the light's not uniform not never is on any of this all right first one down watch your drink that's number one there goes my sounds like they're with my fan unclipped yeah we'll get to it later let's do number two now number two watch the lady drink now we're going to do the third bottle just like we did the last one put in a quarter of the bottle into here a little bit more not much there it is see that i think you can see that now let's go ahead and get to the top all right now same process see if i can figure out how to do this without getting in the in the way do a little bit first do a little bit first to get that surface tension broke otherwise you can still see some of it still drips out from the side see that right here from the side but it does work pretty good give a little bit of time for it to break through that surface tension of the soil and kind of work its way down and then we'll hit it again and let it sit i love this method here this method works great simple easy it might be more time consuming but what the hell take your time and everything that you do right your plants will love you for it that is for sure and i'm gonna admit i'm gonna probably wait even a little bit longer and start cutting some of this out i don't want to rush these too much i'm trying to rush to get through the video so i don't take so long but maybe i should just let it sit and we'll just cut out sections of it that would require that i'd have to stop talking though wouldn't it i know right oh gosh thank you guys for coming and watching the video i hope that what i'm doing is uh appreciated and worthwhile because that's why i do these videos try to make them worthwhile so we got that done and look she doesn't drink all her she's thirsty yep she's thirsty so we've got uh these two done and it's looking pretty good looking pretty good we'll work on the next three and uh we'll go from there i don't think i'll show you the next three i'll show you kind of how i do my [ __ ] because it takes a little ah it takes a little time to do the other three to be here all day but that's how i water i wanted to show you how i do it i'm gonna go ahead and get the other threes done oh [ __ ] better zoom back in i don't want to show you too much see how they're saggy though uh come back man i'll be putting a post on another video here in a couple days you'll be able to see my see how they look please uh come back every week please like subscribe click that bell tell your friends post comments below share my videos all that [ __ ] is great i appreciate it i want this to be a community of growers that help each other out and enjoy what each other does and uh that's the plan so appreciate all of you guys and everyone coming to my video coming and watching them and everything please keep coming back i am the cannabis reviewer and as i always say happy smoking", "6foOf4sH2T8": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I just ran some bubble hash I still got a [ __ ] little more to run this is just a little bit running around right now this is what I came out looking like these one that's the first I'm gonna take it out into some bedding that guys give me one second hopefully you guys can see this alright that right there is the first one that I run and I think that's the 90 micron and that one is this as a 30 micron same first run and that's the second one of the of the 30 and the and the 8 and the the 90 micron mixed together so that's what I ended up getting out of it I haven't weighed here the way that I take my my water out of my half guys there's a couple of different ways to you can just crumble it down and let it dry and put it on some cardboard or you can use a mat like this this is basically just a 25 micron mat and you just get the hash together you squeeze it together I'll show you on this one just squeeze it together and you squeeze out all the water and you can put a towel over it and so got all humidity out of it and what you're left with is the ball of hash and you can do this a few times you can do this as many times until you don't get no more eventually what's gonna happen is gonna get so sticky it's gonna stick to the mat as you can see it's already done in the past it'll get so sticky that it'll start sticking to the mat and it'll be really really really like putty and then from there on you can let it dry 24 to 48 hours depending on how dry you want it I don't like my hat my hair just stays pretty moist because it's pretty sticky it's usually dank I don't really use a lot of trim this is more buds than anything else but you can see how good the quality of the hash is and this is bubble hash guys people always talking about drying their hash out breaking it down there's a lot of different ways to do hash guys not just one way there's hash as part of the oldest concentrate ever I mean like the first concentrate on the oldest so there's so many different ways to use it and so many different ways to dry it and in consume it that people just don't realize how to do it or they just think that they know what they're talking about a lot of people in the world that you know that's fine you like to do it your way but everybody has a different way of doing it it's not just one way of doing it and your way isn't always the right way or the best way you know I'm saying just like this might not be the best way but I'm trying to show you guys the difference is and how to do it because a lot of people out there will give you bad information misinformation they don't know what they're talking about there's a lot of different ways to do it guys it's not just one way and I tell you this because it's not that difficult to make hash guys hash is probably the easiest and the most but the most easiest thing to make the concentrate ways just unless you're making like dry sift or something sorry guys my cats are trying it out you can see the quality of the hash that came out real gold and there's a little bit of plant material in there I got in there but not a lot this is all for personal use anyway I'm gonna probably press this all in the rosin guys I'll let this I'll probably press it out a few more times like I said what I'll do is I'll put it in the map I know it looks dirty that's all the rosin from all the other different types of paste and you can get a towel put one on the top one on the bottom you can push out all of that moisture and then what you're left with is just a block of hash or a couple blocks depending on how you do it I said there's a little bit of plant material in there but that's alright I'm thinking that mmm I'm gonna I'm gonna press this all in the rosin guys I probably have about pounds of that I'm gonna press enter into rosin guys and I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about most of this gonna be pressed into rosin guys you can see it's all buds and I got I got [ __ ] loads of it it's not the best trim in the world but it's a lot of Platt so right now I just this is stuff actually that I had in the freezer it was probably a bag about this size right here it's probably about half the size of this bag right here this is another one I'm gonna do tomorrow this is some other stuff that I have here and like I said all buds [Music] [Applause] and these are pretty contact guys that's all wet still come in the plant that was never dried this one that I just brought it was dry guys I let it dry out for about about four days before I actually froze it it was in between right but right before you got to cure it I guess but I just like I said I ran it made it easier on myself because I got so much material that I have to run it just makes it easier for myself and like I said I run the 25 micron I run the 90 micron and then I run the filter bag along with the work bag that's on the bottom right here and that's how I make my bubble hash case very simple very easy like I said it's one of the first concentrates ever made people like I say it's not hard to do guys and there's no wrong way to do it or to not do it here I'm saying and the only thing you can do wrong this by mixing your material too long because then you'll start getting client matter or the way the ways where I got plant matter of my is because these bags aren't exactly five gallons and they don't slip over the side so I have to leave them and stack like this and when I mix sometimes [ __ ] falls in between the bags and that's why I got material in my hash this is supposed to catch it this this bag here but like I said if it goes in between the top its there's nothing I can do it's gonna go into the next bag over and that's what happened what I'm mixing the the hash and all the buds and the eyes together but next time I'll make a full video guys I just wanted to show you guys the end product and how I put us out the water out of my out of my hash it's really easy guys there's not much to and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make hash if you having to sit there and listen to other people's BS about how they do it and how the right way and the right all this you know I mean hashes oil that's all it is it's just the using ice to extract it from the from the plat matter after you extract it you can press it out like I said you can just put it together in a ball put a rag on the bottom right on the top and you can press on all that moisture and by tomorrow this should be dry enough to press even by tonight even people have different different ways that they do it this is the way I do it and I've never had an issue with you guys if it's still a little moist you want to leave it you don't want to press anything that's wet guys you want to make sure that you're dry enough that that your press isn't gonna because what'll happen is if you if you try to press this wet or if it has moisture in it a lot of moisture yo your oils will come out real funky they'll come out looking either they'll come out mixed with water in it went with the rosin or you'll have a lot of steam and stuff coming off your off your press plates and just a lot of not nothing Goods gonna come from it so like I said people break down their hash they grind it down they put it into a granular that's not necessary you can leave it in a patty you just got to press it out guys that's what the that's where they give you these when you buy your rosin bags you can press out your hash and like I said I've used this thing for years and years and years and years I've actually replaced it this is his party like the third one but you can see all the the hash that gets left behind after pressing it even right now it's pretty sticky as you can see it's a it's gonna stay pretty sticking you can make this into full melt if you really wanted to you can you can press it back down uses some heat and a bottle and you can you can make it even better but that's just the one way of doing it guys and it's not the best way it's not the worst way it just works that's all that matters as long as you're getting what you're what you're looking for in the end see that's what will happen once you press out all the water the hash will start sticking to everything and I mean everything and then that's why I got all this extra [ __ ] on the bag so I usually make sure I pushed a lot of pressure on there and get out as much oil and what will happen is eventually normal water is gonna come out and it's just gonna start sticking to everything and getting rolled like putty like I say and then you'll end up fighting to get it off of the mat so you don't want to be pressing it too too much on this map because you'll have issues later on down the line with trying to get it off the mat like I say and you can use alcohol to clean this if you want to afterwards I just buy a new one but you can do it however you want you can clean it with alcohol when you're done and reuse it again I don't do that I just keep using it and using it too I figure I need a new one and that's it guys that's probably about I don't know five six grams of hash maybe a little more but it still looks a little moisture in there so we'll let it dry out and then we'll go through it away it's May I have two little work guys so have a good one be safe", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to

of the video this is this one here is from the 25 micron bag this one is here is from the 73 micron bag so news from the hundred and twenty micron bag and this one here is from the hundred and sixty micron pack which was yeah didn't I didn't bother collected after the after the first wash because that's what come off the first wash and but the other three there that was the 120 and 73 and 25 oh yeah alright I'm not sure how much I got that I got a dry it out completely and then I mean weigh it and swore a cop but yeah that's it it'll dry on the in this 25 micron screen no and then yeah see what happens there anyway thanks for watching guys and like I saved my first time and yeah alright I think just just just good and it was yeah we're quite fine I said there was a bull and not sure how many grams there were but it wasn't much it wasn't much over I hadn't really gone think that's wrong yeah thanks for watching guys bye", "9Hjg3sMsz3U": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome to another live stream it is time to put in some work time to wash we're going to be washing some single source minnow breath from my last harvest i got the room all set up and ready to go see we got the 32 gallon wrapped in the pele polar got the new 32 gallon 220 mesh bag here got a nice little drain set up on here with the bucket lids on a shorter brute tote down here and that is plumbed around the back of the reservoir to my drain over there we've got a stand for the hose now our mount for the hose and we've got a nice big reservoir full of ice water so the last thing to do is to go and grab my material weigh it out and get started and i believe today we're going to be going with anywhere from a three to a four pound wash today i'm not 100 sure i'm gonna weigh it out and we'll see kind of how it looks how it feels uh we've got the lab area set up nice and neat here today we got the uh hash spoon for collection got the stainless steel paddle with no holes in it we've got the stainless steel paddle with holes in it and then we've got the large poly handle with the uh t-handle here so we got all three of those i'm gonna go ahead and probably wipe this one down and give this one a shot today and we got the 1100 pound jegs table lift here pump's going over there now so it's all nice and clean and we're going to make some good hash here today got a dehumidifier on or cranking the ac at 62. i don't need a cool bot i don't find it's necessary i'm not making full melt here and uh we got you guys set up up here so you guys are gonna stay here all [ __ ] day [Music] so um yeah let's get to it i'm gonna go start grabbing material from the freezer i've gotta [ __ ] dig deep in there there's just there's too much material in there so i'm gonna go dig through there and find the [ __ ] that i want and i'll be right back so [Music] all right so i guess we'll start with this this is a 568 grams of untrims looks like lowers mostly lowers here this is 425 grams of lowers and this is 575 grams of lowers i'm just gonna do a quick way out on these accurate accurate accurate let's go so [Music] i'm not quite sure if you can see all the way over there but i'm gonna go wipe down my white board real quick i'm gonna start fresh so all right now we write down these numbers 5.75 425 and six burnout 568 that's 1568 grams [Music] hmm all right i'm gonna grab some fresh ice and um we don't need this to be this high right now so we're gonna take this off of there slide this over and drop this down okay where it needs to be grab some ice uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] so oh my god it smells so good oh that good hmm breaking apart nice how i like it smells like hot baby diaper after eating seas candy like a two-year-old got a hold of way too much seas candy and took

[ __ ] put anime over dubs in [Music] uh oh slippery i need to put grip on there that's mad slippery son about to put a towel on that [ __ ] i almost bust my ass right now real [ __ ] i'm about to put some skateboard grip tape on that hole good workout good for glutes oh i'm so glad i didn't have to pick your big heavy ass up [ __ ] cause baby you fine and all but i ain't picking you up for just going to 69. i'm gonna lay my ass down on the bed [Music] thank you [Music] you know what i'm saying [ __ ] done done [Music] oh man [Music] so easy [Music] kevin says that paddle is trash who's kevin i don't give a [ __ ] again it says kevin you must be a professional kayaker that title was no good you can't swim upstream with the sand in with that paddle it's not good enough sorry kevin [Music] excuse me man [Music] allergies [Music] so i think it's done chilling how nervous i was when i first got this i was like hmm that's why i got the 1100 pound not uh 500 pounds 500 pounds is cute but come on all right let's go ahead and drain this [ __ ] see what we got going on here i didn't even put my [ __ ] collection tool into ice yet what am i doing let me grab something to put it actually i'm just going to throw it in the bottom of this ice right here [Music] you guys probably want to get in close but too bad so [Music] [Music] so oh it smells so good it's like a nice pink color [Music] i want to make sure this is draining yeah it is the water is coming out nice and clean i couldn't tell and then i gotta plug in my pump out here all right there we go and make sure all my pumps and everything were turned on and draining properly [Music] so [Music] how simplified is this setup ice water reservoir a simple pump one big trash can with an insulator a mesh bag on top of a table a smaller reservoir on the bottom with some bucket lids stacked together with your other bags that's easy i'm chilling oh my back psych not anymore [Music] how well [Music] but i already know what pump on you this is just temporary [Music] you guys can see the stainless steel setup that i have being fabricated right now it's all of this but in stainless steel [Music] i'll have them for sale on my website for you guys that are serious hashers that are trying to elevate your game i'll have the stainless steel vessels available with the custom pele polar insulators on them and they'll have the stainless steel catch system all available directly on my site [Music] yes oh well this is gonna take a while [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right [Music] is available [Music] foreign so i have some changes that i'm going to make once i move into the actual shed um a i'm going to probably end up getting a bigger reservoir in the future but immediately i'll be getting a different pump that can handle handle a high flow and high pressure this one's just low flow high pressure so i'm going to get a high flow high pressure and i'll have dedicated plumbing where i'll have one that goes to waste so i can empty the reservoir i'll have one that goes to fill this up and then i'll have another one that goes to a hose bib and then that way i can turn on the valve start filling this up it'll fill this up and i can spray down the other one while i'm going you know what i'm saying and i won't have to stop and wait it'll be a more constant workflow if that makes sense [Music] no i don't need anything for the catch tote why do you guys think i need wheels on the ketchup toe where's the ketchup going the ketchup is not being moved unless it's empty you know what i'm saying it really doesn't it doesn't need wheels trust me but the one that i'm having fabricated is gonna have spots where you can screw in casters if you want but you really don't want it because you got to think the table lift can only go so high if you add casters to the catch system then now you're you're decreasing the amount of available space for you to use more bags you know what i'm saying the way i have it planned out you'll be able to use all bags or as few bags as you want and still fit underneath almost all of the available lifts out there at 28 inches but i mean realistically the way that you would have this set up you would never need to really move the catch toe ever you know um everything will be set up in a line against the wall your hard plumb and uh you wouldn't move [ __ ] around at all but i guess this is temporary in here this is only nine and a half feet long by 70. we're going to be putting the hashtag's gonna be seven by fourteen so we're gonna get a whole extra five feet that's amazing that's a lot of space i mean i offered hash classes to people and people didn't want to pony up the money money for it so i was like [ __ ] it i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna keep marketing my classes when people aren't willing to pay the money for it like it's just stupid people crying over 500 bucks 250 bucks like you're in the wrong [ __ ] industry then homies get in the wrong [ __ ] industry i smoked that amount of house in like a day or two so if you're not willing to punting up that amount of money to learn what it you know how i got to this point how to set up your workflow how to design your room all that [ __ ] and you can't pick it up from the youtube videos i already do you need extra time yeah [ __ ] you're gonna pay my time isn't free so yeah that pissed me off and i stopped off her in classes [Music] if you were legitimate facility trying to set up a hash setup and you don't know what it takes to be successful you're willing to pay 10 15 grand for a consultant to come in and help you set up a washroom and show you what to do so that when you pull down your first crop and you go to wash some of it you don't [ __ ] off 10 15 20 grand in product but all these [ __ ] tent growers they just want a shortcut to learn how to make fire ass head stash so they're only concerned about washing maybe a pound or so so they're like oh 250 dollars [Music] that's just a part of this process [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is [Music] when i was a baby [Music] i'm gonna swap this hose out though [Applause] i mean like in less [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] is just like i'm [Music] now you know all right [Music] foreign when the 160 dumps like this it's a good [ __ ] day and that means i grew to full

"JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music]

I've just been busy trimming my memo was done I probably got about 2 ounces left my last plant and I just also feel like it's a little bit unnecessary to have a update every week in your grow room there's not much to talk about I still have the same 3 plants in there as I did three weeks ago my flower tent I am about to transition a couple more plants from veg to flower probably tomorrow or something so you'll be able to see that the next week's update anyways today I decided to try and make some bubble hash that was my first attempt and yeah these are my results so this right here so I ran I had six different runs I did three runs of two different batches so you'll kind of see here there's a left and the right on each pad kind of thing on the left one I was the first plant right one it's a second plant so anyways this one I just kind of combine them both because I don't even know if you're supposed to smoke this this right here is the stuff like I had my two 20 micron bag these right here but from my 190 micron bag this one's for my 160 this one was from 120 just a lot as long as my 45 micron and this one was from my 25 so I'm just kind of breaking it up just making sure it dries well oh yeah that's it for this week I'll see you guys again next Thursday in the garden have a good one", "GvuOtkXDjs0": "[Music] [Music] [ __ ] i'm a snake the way that i'm moving cause

pub everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video is gonna be all about what we can do do as I trim and what not and one thing I'm really gonna get back into is making some awesome bubble hash cuz it needs to come back I'm wearing a wint I know everybody's making the concentrates worth it but guess what you can make bubble hash and impress that and make even better concentrates with the Rawls on press so we're gonna be taking you through that we'll do a press probably depending on how much boba hash I end up getting back if you've never tried true bubble hash it is amazing and you should definitely try it super crazy easy super crazy healthy it's literally your trim you need some ice in some water and that's you know all you need is a nice long story stick and that's that but oh and the bubble bag so we have a Leo 5 bag setup so we have a work bag and then a floor base here from if it's 160 again a 25 micron and four different levels of hash you can use this for edibles from certain levels all the way down to some really nice full melt prettiness so we're gonna take it through it step by step if you knew the channel make sure to subscribe make sure to give me a like so literally what we had going on I had this bag in the freezer it's from this last harvest the strawberry schnitz little whatnot and we have a bunch more too but you can see there's some little mugs and stuff in there we've let it dry out completely I couldn't fit it all in the freezer because my wife would kill me so I want to add that much in the freezer so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put in there put that in there and then let some ice in there for a little while but to let that melt down I let this dry out I recommend you doing that as well there's two methods in doing this I've seen done both ways some people like to do their bag inside of all their bags I like to be a little more rough with it so I just have two five-gallon buckets you can get them at Home Depot and yeah so unless I sit up in here for a little while cool this down so that's the name of the game is getting this really nice and cold I'm going to start melting down there then we're gonna add some water and I'll be back with you all right so now that I've had a piece of pizza and drink a piece a little bit of Red Bull I've put ice in here before I started doing all that so that way I start cooling down those trichomes cuz that's what we're trying to do is keep those trichomes as cold as possible so they fell a plant material so now we need to add water I've had this in my freezer as well for a little bit that's optional so I'm gonna get it to the copra metal water where I can actually stir this and get down to the bottom and get a good nice rinse that's literally all we're trying to do so I can get the flow going and we'll be right back all right so I got my trusty dusty Red Bull with me cuz I'm gonna need that and I got a nice soup tea mixture going here so as you can probably see so what we're gonna do now ensuring this as hard as we possibly can for as long as you possibly can add ice as it starts melting the more the better cuz the more trichomes we're trying to get all those trichomes to fall off the plant material all through this work bag and then we're gonna pour it all into these bags and separate itself and make our hash so I'm gonna get the stern and I'm not gonna make you watch super crazy long and me just sitting here but you do want to make sure you get all the way to the bottom full mix everything good add ice you should go to keep it cold colder it is the more trichomes we're gonna fall off so I'm going to beat the crap out of this for now and then we'll be back all right here in constant [Applause] 20 minutes now much as I could you can do a second round I'm probably going to do a second run so what I'll do is I'll drain this take this work bag out outside of my boxes clean boxes as clean as it can be anyways four boxes Pat but and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna pour this the water that's in this tub after this work bag has been pulled out we're gonna give it a little shake and then everything that's left in this tub we're gonna go ahead and run through these and we have mouths spaced out there's four of them here and they're in here you want a little bit of room left at the bottom of the bucket so yeah we're gonna go ahead and get to that yes you got our work bag pulled up here drinks all right so we took you out of that I'm in here I put that one back in Nick so I'm gonna do a second rung so we have about a quarter left of this bucket lift so I can see it a little bit more in there as you can see it's part of the reason why we call it bubble Heche because it is bubbling all right so that's the first run and I'm gonna give you a couple of quick pointers for the second run what I like to do is I'd like to pull my first bag all the way down as you can see so I can get it up there and I'm gonna slowly pour in this after I take this work but I got just the water that's left in here how much slowly pour it in there so that way I have an even nice cleanup area I'm only cleaning this up the hash can get nicer every bag that we go through so I'm also going to keep a little thing of water and every single bag we go through once we get it all in here I'm gonna come back and I'll show you I'll scrape it will go on move to the next bag do the same thing one more little pointer when we are gone I like to pull my bag all the way up as much as I can so that way there's a little bit of room between the water and that and this bucket and I like to pour some fresh water on top giving the bag and a mic of where the water line is a couple inches in between so that way it pushes any extra loose trichomes that may be stuck pushes them out and then we will use that water all right so I've drained it through here through my other bags and then I empty took them all out emptied that water in here so that way we were left with an empty bucket now and then let it all drain in there so that way we had a nice empty bucket to start with because you'll notice there's some little granules on the side so what I like to do as you can see all the other bags are pretty much like this level I pulled this one up a couple inches so that way there's a little gap in between bags and what I do is I'll have a little bit extra water and I just want to do a nice small pore along the sides real fast just to get it down there just enough to give us a nice little area and then we're gonna pull this bag up nice and flat now let's pull it up nice and flat and we're gonna grab a credit card or something of that nature and start scooping it and setting it on our little pile alright so what I got here is a 25 micron press mat what I'm gonna use for this is to collect all that and put it in here I'm gonna give it a press and get some that moisture out on top of one of those cardboards and then I'm gonna use the dab man to separate everything so I'll show you what it looks like all right so that's what we collected from the 160 we're gonna fold it over on itself and press some of that water out this is gonna be mostly used for like edibles stuff like that I might even press it in some rosin all right so you got that 160 you here took up my dad match set it over there for now cuz you don't want the water moisture on there yeah we're just gonna give this a little swish on that cardboard and as you can see it'll start pushing some of that water out alright that's what we're left with there you see there's still a lot of green in here whatnot so that's why this one isn't the best for smoking but yeah put that on there I'm gonna kind of chunk it up together use my trusty dusty card and just trying to get some of this stuff and pull it back to the middle and I'll put on a dead man all right now we're gonna move on the next bag do the exact same thing since we got that I'll square it away over here you know we're gonna keep on separating it and so we have all the bags cleared alright so there you have a couple of different forms of hash this one's pretty much best for edibles whatnot probably impress this one and some rousing really good smokeable and then the finest smokeable will just be nice and gold once it dries out a little bit this would be a little bit better colored but some of the product I ran was like couple months old from my not last harvest but my harvest before that so yeah looking good though you just let this dry chop it up a little bit if you'd like to help it dry a little bit faster says somewhere dark kind of warm so that way it dries out because we wanted to be dried don't want any mold happen or anything like that but that is how you make hash if you would like to see how you press hash into some super fire rosin stick around stay tuned and hit that notifications bell", "Ht6X9fAG9zQ": "while the color of bubble hash can be indicative of a variety of factors including indoor versus outdoor material cured versus fresh frozen material and freshly made versus age / melt civility is not one of them without doing the fire test you never know what you're dealing with I recently dabbed ninety micron bubble hash its color was a mild beige that would have tricked the eyes of the unexperienced but it did not perform micron isolation does not ensure melts ability either you will learn all of this information and more at my upcoming class in Oakland California on February 23rd kinds of this hands-on training to elevate your knowledge and understanding passionately not only should we grow our own but we can make our own because we deserve to give ourselves the best [Music]", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer pressure thanks for tuning in [Music]", "bPtgrC2fuVY": "hey what's up youtube all right guys um i'm gonna start this video again i started it and then i [ __ ] up and i accidentally [ __ ] it up but anyways i'm gonna make some bubble hash on this video guys i'm gonna show you how i make it i got a 5 gallon bucket set up with all my micron bags and i'm i'm not running every single micron bag guys i'm running the 30 and the 70. the filter bag and then the work bag okay so i'm only filtering out the 70 and the 30 micron and i'm using 15 pounds of ice and buds you guys uh out these are a bunch of lowers and some trim that i have so it's hard to see but it's all frosty buds um so i have it set up now i've dropped in about already about two ounces maybe a little more than two ounces and i have another three there and it's all buds and trim guys so most it's gonna be a good yield on this one um for now i'm just gonna set it up like i said i got a layer ice i got it two ounces or three ounces of bud i'm gonna drop in another uh five pounds of ice another layer and keep layering it until i get there guys give me one second and i'll be right back with you all right guys i put in the other three and a half ounces uh all together it's about i don't know seven eight ounces something like that maybe half a pound uh but it's quite a bit of cannabis in there so i'm gonna go ahead and fill it up with water now and this is just tap water and this is uh my broomstick i just take off the broom handle and i use that as my uh as my uh mixer you can use a drill but a drill is uh too aggressive for me and it'll uh it knocks off the car film i just fill up the bucket so i see that there's uh just enough water in there to mix up all the cannabis and the water and the ice mixed together this is called the cold water extraction guys for anybody that's not familiar with this procedure and you can see there's still quite a bit of ice in there and there's just enough water in there for me to mix it around so what i'm gonna do is mix this up for about 15 to 20 minutes a little bit and i'm going to mix the ice the water and the cannabis all together and i'm going to mix the more i agitate it the more uh trichomes are going to fall off the buds guys and this green bag here is the filter bag it catches anything that makes it through this big and then after that is the actual uh the filters which is the 70 micron and the 30 micron i can actually add a little bit more ice in here because there's not enough ice all right give me one second guys all right guys i know it's hard to see that's why i brought out a flashlight but right there that's about the perfect amount of ice and cannabis mixture there's quite a bit of cannabis in there like i said and water mixture you just want it slushy you don't want it you don't want too much water in there you just want enough water to separate and agitate the material and the more you mix it and the faster you mix it the more uh more trichomes are going to knock off so you want to do this for about 20 minutes guys in about 10 minute increments so you want to do it for 10 minutes let it rest for a few minutes and then go back and hit it again and then you can do a second watch you guys this is just going to be the first wash and then yeah and then we'll go from there give me a second and then i'll bring you guys back around once i finish watching this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i'm just showing you guys how i mix it and how long i mix it for and how aggressive i am with it the faster you go the more you're going to knock off the trichomes but you're also going to break up a lot of the foliage and the buds as well and that's going to allow everything the more you make it the colder it gets because the ice and water mix together especially when you mix it it gets colder than ice actually is so that's how it works the process and like i said it freezes the trichomes off of all the buds and whatever filters through this first bag gets caught as far as the garbage and everything else the trichomes will fall into the different micron bags whatever you have stacked i do have them all but i don't feel necessary to run all those other microphone bags that's the 70 and the 30 i think are more than enough to filter out all of what you're going to need as far as the trichomes go try not to hit the bottom of your bag guys with your stick because you might tear it or rip it and then you'll you'll contaminate all the rest of your product just by mixing it like this will agitate it enough to knock off all the trichomes and this is pretty much like a light wash a 20-minute wash is really really light especially if you're using bud instead of trim if you're using trim you want to go a little bit more aggressive but you'll get more chloroform which means uh the green will beat screw all the material but in the end it doesn't really matter because you're gonna wash it and i'll show you when we get to that point i'll see you guys here in about 20 minutes after i'm done mixing this up all right guys i've been mixing for about 10 minutes now what i do is i pull the bag up and i just kind of drain it knock everything all the water through it and then i'll let it float back in the water and fill up the bag again and then i'll start mixing and i'll do it uh i'll let it rest for about four minutes five minutes and then i'll start mixing again guys but for now i'm gonna let all everything that i agitated settled through the filters and go through the filters and collect and then i'll see you guys here in about five minutes and we'll start to mix again all right guys it's been about five minutes i'm gonna go ahead and start mixing again and i'll do this for another 10 minutes i'll run about 5 minutes and then i'll wait a second like 30 seconds and then i'll start again it seems real repetitive but that's how you get the most out of your uh your buds or your trim as far as hashtags and then from this you can make it into rosin and you can do it a bunch of different ways to make rods you can do with the hair straightener you can do it with the iron you can do it with a hot plate and an iron sorry my cat's running around it's going crazy and by pulling up the bag guys what it does is it filters it pulls everything to the bottom and just leaves the ice and the cannabis in there and as it settles the water starts coming up underneath and you can start mixing again and there's still quite a bit of ice in there guys ice cannabis a lot of cannabis you could tell i'm not mixing it too hard because the water's like a lime green and it's not green like the color of the the leaf you don't want that to bleach through you can wash it off at the end with oral water or just tap water but give me a second we'll get to that point guys [Applause] [Applause] all right guys i'll be back with you when we go to the sifting process give me one second all right guys it's been about 10 minutes i'm still mixing it i'm gonna mix it for about another uh probably a minute and a half two minutes and then we're gonna go to the sink and i'll show you how i shift out my cannabis in my heart [Music] all right guys in order to sift out your cannabis uh these aren't necessary but they're good to have uh they're micron screens this is a 30 micron i think or 25 micron i'm not sure exactly these are 25 micron if it zooms in and focuses there we go 25 micron okay so these are 25 micron bags and what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna is i'll set it up here on my counter right there and when i'm done uh scooping it out of the bag i'll scoop it right on to there and i'll fold it over and i'll press it with the towel on the bottom of the top and it's gonna strain out all of the all of the water and it's going to leave just behind just the just the rosin just the hash so this is uh these are essential to have and you can buy them on amazon or ebay for like anywhere from uh three dollars to to fifteen dollars depending on how many you buy i usually buy them in bulk and you can buy them uh ten packs five packs uh three packs you can buy them individually uh but they're really really necessary in order to make the to sift out the hash you can you can just let it dry out on a piece of cardboard as well if you don't have any screens you can just get a piece of cardboard put it on there and just uh scrape it up after the fat on the cardboard and it'll just come right up like i said the cardboard will suck out most of the most of the water uh this is just a way to sift it out you put it on top and you squeeze it and i'll show you how that's done when we get to that process but for now we're still mixing up the hash and we're gonna give it another probably let me see if i sing zoom in if it'll clear up there we go so we're going to mix this up for about another minute and then i'll show you guys how we do the the extraction process [Applause] you you don't want to try to mix it too hard guys you don't want your material or water to fall between the bags because what will happen is it'll contaminate your hash that green bag is actually a filter bag so if anything falls in between there it'll catch it but you don't want to try to mix it too aggressive where it's splashing because the water carries a lot of hash and a lot of material and it'll contaminate your hash if it falls in between the flaps usually you're supposed to fold them over but this bucket that i have is a little bit wider than a regular five gallon bucket and these bags don't fold over so i'm just doing it like this and then you know i don't have any issues just don't uh don't don't uh don't fill your bags up too much and too much ice and where it's going to fall over or fall between your bags you don't want that to happen because it will contaminate your hash you'll have pieces of uh of bud or whatever material in your hashing and you'll see it too you can pick it out but you don't want to it's better just to do it right the first time you can even add more ice as the ice mouth when you're mixing as you can see there's not i mean there's still quite a bit of ice in there but you can add more ice and it'll freeze it even faster uh the colder bets the better that's why you keep your your fresh frozen in the freezer as soon as you trim it off the plant you put it right in the freezer and you just freeze it and that's why when you're freezing it makes it easier for it to fall off the track when you actually put it in the ice in the water all right guys we're going to go ahead and do our bag extraction i'm going to show you how that works right now let me back up my tripod and there's the other bucket that we're going to use and uh as soon as this thing clears up all right so what i do guys is i pull out my bag and it's going to filter out all the water and all the sediment all the all the hot is going to come out the bottom and i kind of mixed it up as the water is going through because it's just like stirring it up but all right guys and i'm going to go straight into another five yellow bucket so i don't use any of that hash water that's coming out the bottom because that'll go on my next run all right and this one right here is just my filter bag this catches all the trash any trash that may come through that bag or if that falls on the side so it's not really a 14 this one here is our zombie micron and it's pretty loaded i can tell you now because the water is kind of coming out fast and this bag changes pretty fast so what i do guys is i got the top just like this and i'll pull up the other bag make sure i'm not going to lose any of this water because anything that comes through this bag is going to get caught in the 30 micron any other hatch and i'll shake the bag let's see how fast that water came out because that tells me that there's some hash in this bag how much i don't know we'll see i used quite a bit of material so we'll see you don't want to let any of this water go to waste because anything that's falling out is getting caught in that second bag guys remember that we got a good little mountain here and this is actually some people prefer this bag over all the others as far as quality of the cannabis goes because uh this is the gold gold bag this is the one that comes out the most uh golden and actually i've had 30 micron come out golden too but it just depends on the material all right guys we're gonna come to the bag over here set the tripod up let's bring it up now it doesn't look like quite a bit now but once i run some water i'm going to run some water through this and all that right there is hash guys the gold selection and i'll tell you i'll show you how that looks like here in just a second give me one second so i'm going to lay the bag in there i got a cup of tap water right here i'm just going to wet the sides walls down wash any hash that got that got caught on the sides i'm going to wash it all down to the bottom screen and i'm going to shake it and it's going to all gather together in one spot um and no matter how much water you want to i probably lost a little hat from the bottom end because there might have been some 30 micron that just went down the sink but uh it's all right and now i'm gonna pick up the bag and let it all gather in the middle and i'm gonna wet it down let it catch all together just shake it this one is probably the easiest bag of hash to make because uh the micron is not so small where you can't uh or you can gather it with a 30 micron it catches everything and you have to really work at that bag right now what i'm doing is i'm just running cups of water through it and i'm washing it washing off any of that green color that may be in the hash and you guys will see that if you mix your hash too much it'll it'll actually turn your hash green now what i'm doing is i'm going to grab the bottom of the bag where the hash is at i'm squeezing it you see it and i'm going to bring up through the bag and then right there is our hash and you can see how good quality that hash is this is the creme de la creme most people like the 70 and a couple of other microns that that uh that they like but that's a good amount of hash guys if you guys ever run hash you know it takes a lot of material to make hash and you can see that this hash is actually really decent this will be really really sticky if i uh don't uh gather it real quick and put it on the on the microphone bag on the screens and i'm going to show you that process right now guys you can use a spoon or you can use a credit card or whatever you want see how that one just fell right out and you can just scoop it all on on the spoon and then just knock it down on the screen and you can even run more water through this and gather all the all the hash on here that you can't see that's real small because this stuff is like dust guys um it's just gathered together with the ice and the water and you see it after the fact is it's like a sediment and there's still hash on here guys but anyways what i wanted to show you guys about the sifting process so i got a cloth here just a regular cloth i'm gonna fold the the hash over and i'm gonna put it on the outside of both sides of the hash and i'm going to press on this guys and the water is going to get absorbed by the by the by the rag and the hash is going to be on the inside and that's your finished product guys or one of them and then you can uh you can squeeze this out a little bit more if you like um like i said i'm gonna go ahead and run the run the water through this bag and i'm gonna collect whatever i didn't miss whatever it was on there because i know there's quite a bit of quite a bit of material still in there and this is just the first wash guys this is not a aggressive wash by any means most people uh do aggressive and they wash their stuff really really really vigorously and that's where you'll get that green tint to your hash and you can wash most of it out but sometimes you can't wash it all out that's why not i try not to get that aggressive on my first wash and i try to keep it as simple as possible um so what's left in there is uh about another quarter teaspoon of hash as soon as i gather it all together but that's like i said that's pretty much the way it works guys it's not very hard it's not complicated and then i still got the 30 micron which is quite a bit too uh let me pause this video because it's getting long as hell and then uh we'll get to that all right guys i'm getting the last 30 micron bag as you can see it takes a lot to get this through because it's a it's a really really fine fine bag the 30 micron is really really small and this is what i do to get out because it it'll get real foamy as you shake it as you can see inside the bucket all the foam and uh i'll try to squeeze out as much as i can you're not supposed to do this but it just takes too long to do it any other way at least for me it does i get all impatient and i'll go to the sink here we'll open it up see how much hash we got in there and it looks like a decent amount i'm just gonna run the sink turn it half a gallon of water 16 ounces of water go through there and then uh it takes a while you got it this is the way i do it guys this is the quickest way to get it out of there and and i know it's cold that's why i clearly empty it out and then i do a little bit of tap water so it brings it down to temp um but it's not going to filter through this bag once it's uh in this bag but this is how you get off the rest of the water and it takes a while guys just be patient try not to force it through like sometimes i'll squeeze the bag the way i was doing just before i brought it up to the thing uh but this is uh the other way to get it out because if not you have to wait for it and it takes forever and even if you leave it sitting there it'll it won't drain completely you have to physically go in and drain it but once most of the water is drained you can just squeeze the bag and most of the house will be on the bottom and like i said this is a quick wash guys you can wash it three times or even four times i don't usually do it more than twice or sometimes three times it just depends on the material and how much i'm running just be patient that's all it is being patient i'll uh be back with you guys in just a second hold on all right guys look at all that hash in there i know it doesn't look like much but it's quite a bit give me one second all right guys so that's the finished product of the 30 micron it's like peanut butter but the best kind of peanut butter and this is actually more than the the 90 or 70 micron and it looks just as good that's why i really don't do any other ones and these two because they always come out really really similar and the quality is always the same if you're growing quality and you're putting quality in you'll get quality out and see how golden that is compared to that one it's very it it's barely any difference this one looks a little lighter to me but there's at least a quarter ounce right here of uh of product and it'll be real fire once it's dried and a lot of people put this under a press and press out all the water you don't have to do all that guys as long as you're putting your body weight on it and you're using the right micron screen you're gonna get all the water out and then it'll dry within 24 hours see look there's a piece of material that got through right there is that green a piece of a leaf or something went through the screen and made it through that screen but uh no biggie we can sit that out after the fact and uh i probably will i'm gonna go ahead and rinse this bag one more time run a little bit more water gather the rest of the hatch together and now i'm gonna do another maybe wash or two and i'll probably end up with about uh 10 to 18 grams of hash by the time i'm done i've cured done hash because i usually let it cure for about a week or two and then we'll have a nice uh oxidation on the outside but the inside will be nice and creamy and light colored i'll usually mix these together to be honest i usually don't uh separate them and then i'll press them into hash but everybody has their preferences on how they like the hash this is the way i do it it's real simple it's easy um you can even save this hash and break it up like some people do or you can just leave it in a ball and it'll oxidize and it'll turn into like a temple ball you can roll it and some heat with your hands or a bottle and make some even better hash full melt if you like but yeah there's a lot of ways you can a lot of things you can do with hash from edibles me my personally what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it into rosin and then use it from there and uh edibles or however i want to use it but that's the best way i like to do it because i can do my dabs smoke my oil that's how i like my oils personally but yeah so this is my process guys real simple easy it takes about an hour to do it but a little longer because this time i'm showing you the process as a step by step more or less and the bags that i use and like i say that green bag there is just a filter bag it's not it's not for any hash or anything uh the two filter bags that i do use of the 70 and the 30 micron that's it and then a filter bag to catch any junk of course and then uh the work bag which is the 30 micron which is in there in the bucket underneath the green bag because i'm still going to wash this material at least one more time but yeah that's how i do it guys so if you have any comments or anything you want to know anything let me know in the comments below have a good one stay safe and stay medicated guys have a good one", "9DJ3hRZBgTQ": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome back to another live stream it is time to do it do what dab [ __ ] so get your dab rigs out get your rosin ready if you're not smoking rosin i don't know what you're smoking but uh as long as it's not bh no that's okay let's take some dabs we get some music going here i downloaded the [ __ ] tj [ __ ] but i guess i did it oh oh what's that yes here it is let's select all and play blackout 2 a m [Music] [Music] i am the light controlled by the sun i know [Music] [Music] me [Music] wow [Music] [Music] blackout [Music] is [Music] fire fire [Music] that dab just keeps rolling on me right now [Music] [Music] woo ah that was good [Music] yeah man i got bored with my hair and i was like yo why do something with this [ __ ] no i was [ __ ] i just got a shower and i was like brushing it i put in some stain conditioner and [ __ ] and my [ __ ] my wife was like she said it like three times she was like if you want me to do that just let me know and i'm like you just want to play with my hair huh and she's like no no no i just you know i don't want you to be in pain you know brushing through it if you want me to do it i can do it for you i like babe just come here just come do it i know you want him so she came over and i uh i sat down in her chair at her vanity and let her brush through it and [ __ ] comb it out and put in a little bun showering and streaming totally different uh all right let's get uh let's get this [ __ ] going um let's check on the amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these in there just when i start the water then it gets to where you see it right now where a lot of the ice is melted the water is really cold but it's not full and i add a couple more and we're cranking the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged in out there [Music] we don't have any other pumps or anything on so that should fill up the rest of the way pretty quick and be nice and frosty [Music] [Applause] do i have enough to start a wash sure i'm sure [Music] now you're gonna have to excuse my mess i've been trimming in here so i don't want to hear no [ __ ] but you know me i'm transferring i show it make sure this valve is closed back here we're gonna go ahead and fire up the freeze dryer and pull the trays we're gonna clean the trays and then um [Music] me [Music] alcohol [Music] and then i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] hit my seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right thank you okay [Music] lagging huh [Music] close out some of this [ __ ] i got open on my phone holy moly i had a lot of [ __ ] open [Music] better all right so now i'm gonna just flip the freeze dryer on it turns on and it says updating log files and blah blah during that time if you have a thumb stick in the um side of the freeze dryer or whatever it will go ahead and update the log files that you have on the thumbstick [Music] sit sit we're going to have that [ __ ] unplugged i'm going to put it back in real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i just noticed there is no slaps unacceptable i'm tired of seeing everybody else's slapped up [ __ ] freeze dryers sorry my man puffin i love you bro but i'm not putting your sticker on my freeze dryer it's too [ __ ] big send me another small one and i'll put it on there but i am not sticking that big ass [ __ ] penguin on my freeze dryer i've got to have the biggest slaps on there buddy went into my little stash box here got some slapperonis so we're gonna throw those on there i got these big-ass puffin ones too big sorry buddy boy i thought i had a smaller puffin sticker somewhere i guess not first and foremost the first one that has to go on has to be this one now where do we put this one [Music] hmm right there you feeling that [Music] my yield just went up five percent [Music] hmm and this one up here down here do we want them close to each other yeah we do yeah we do [Music] my yield just went up another two and a half percent and my freeze dryer got about 10 extra [Music] horsepower [Music] and my terps just went up 50 percent yield yield terps slap some [ __ ] slaps on your freeze dryer step your yields up step your terps up no cap [Music] let go i know i have another puffin sticker somewhere around here that was it i think it's in the house i think my daughter has it i gave my daughters some puffin slaps yo what's up with this [ __ ] connection right now hold on a minute it's like everybody at my house on the [ __ ] wi-fi right now there's whistler tech i might have a whistlertech going in the new hashtag not right away not right away it's gonna take probably probably about a month or two because the hashtag itself is costing me quite a bit and the whistlertech units run about 10 grams yeah see that's the thing the battery cover is on it's weird i don't know why it's doing that mr [Music] all right freeze dryer's cooling off we've got to wash some um i don't like how high you guys come on come over here let's go back over here it's cause you guys need to be grounded apparently you guys don't lag when i'm holding you it's weird exotic pointed that out and it seems to be true but um so yeah dab time and then um we're going to clean some trays um we don't run parchment so yeah let's get those uh those dap tools [Music] ready about to be in trim jail for the next couple days i i've been checking it every day it's not ready i think tomorrow is gonna be the day i'm gonna go in there and start taking it all off and doing that final trim it's gonna something [Music] yeah it was stuck in there i just saw that right now and pulled it out alexis [Music] goodbye [Music] [ __ ] the cleanest goddammit mystic talented son of a [ __ ] start your terp caves [Music] on your marks get sets go [Music] [Music] hey my rap from a couple years back i am not a rapper how did that [ __ ] go i've been looking for the lyrics for that should reuse them [Music] [Music] this is [Music] off the top of my head [Music] i'm a poetic genius not like kanye [Music] [Music] for [Music] there won't be no president [Music] [Music] [ __ ] in the face

percy [Music] [Music] [Music] oh that's okay i needed to clean my dab area anyways there we go look at that all clean [Music] that actually worked out [Music] [Music] those of you afraid to do no parchment don't be afraid that [ __ ] is so easy to get it off the parchment or off the tray it works so easy trust me just do it don't be afraid [Music] so tight [Music] yeah gotta do it to the fullest [Music] my people they really tremendous buzz from hip hop i gotta remember what life was it's usually just this crime enjoy yourself remember take your time but we gotta flow like rising when it leaking up this match i got the plant matter i'm looking straight for my dad but gotta put it in the paint [Music] [Music] let's punch space screens nah never heard [Music] hello baby [Music] hey every time we get some troll in here i want you guys to just start singing say bye to the reggie because when i kick him that's a saying bye because that nigga's a reggie all trolls from now on are gonna be referred to as reggie's or reginalds so if you get a troll in here bye bye reginald see you later reggie and then sb is gonna drop the band hammer [Music] [Music] [Music] to the ready i think we're going to make a shirt for this i think we're going to make a buy reginald shirt like bye felicia is going to be bi reginald yeah we're gonna have it we're gonna have a reginald shirt on the fb

a mystic song and i'll write a verse right there on the live stream we'll just write down a verse we'll practice that [ __ ] we'll spin it and then we'll get it over there to mystic don't fool me oh [Music] i used linear pro led side lighting let them know that i sent you maybe it'll give you a hookup maybe no promises [Music] foreign [Music] two [Music] i can't stand um the trimming that i have in here so before we hash i have to shop back just real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] and i found my

[Music] please [Music] it's time [Music] a man who's asking me about space screens versus drying racks i don't know if you're talking about the freeze or nugs but the answer is no i haven't i'm sorry [Music] i just sound good [Music] um [Music] baby [Music] [Music] is i if it dies we're coming back", "eGv1Rp1Doig": "hello ladies and gentlemen for those of you that watch this after the fact this is going to be a rather long video and my rather long I mean we got a little bit of cleanup to do to make but obviously if you're watching this after the fact you probably already know that because the however long this video took it's probably in the corner of the thumbnail that you clicked on yes these are my bubbleman dry sip screens even begin to express how much dry sift and by dress if quality hash I've sifted off of some cannabis with these screens Jesus when you think about it in like monetary from a monetary standpoint if a gram of high-quality hash is worth 50 bucks oh my god the thousands and thousands of dollars I've made worth the passion with these screens anyway they come with LPI or mesh which is 200 110 and 90 and that's reversed from your micron value that makes this a 160 micron a 120 micron and that's about a 70 for a little closer to 74 that's 73 so let me get some jars and buy some jars that just means some things [Music] [Music] sometimes these fall or sometimes it'll move off the yeah you see Lily oh hey real quick shut up scope and stack here not familiar with this company scope and stack you should check them out on Instagram I reached out to them about an item when I bothe my torches was on me of course why would I have those on you at one time anyway um my red torch my original blazer I got they gave me an incredible deal on a silver brushed nickel very like very bright like the way your the way the nozzle looks when it's brand new and then as soon as you light you to torch the one time it starts to get brown on the edge you know what I mean like just bright beautiful clean bright silver so I put that one on my red torch and I hacked I just commented on it like right after I bought that from them which they gave me a great deal they posted the green one with a red torch and I just commented underneath they they're like oh man now I gotta get a green one too and scope and stack thank you guys I opened up the mail and sure enough there's my beautiful silver one I'm gonna cut in an incredible deal on already and you paired it with a green one as a surprise you guys [ __ ] Rock and for the record for anybody on the fence about these things like well that was a bad example because when are you ever gonna do that with a torch but the idea is that your torch is very very weighted very heavy if you're on a you know I'm not sticky if you're on a nonstick surface your torch is going to move before it's gonna fall over it's gonna mean like it's just it's awesome and then of course the heat guard anybody that has the Blazer knows you cannot do this for this long the silver part is [ __ ] hot by now yeah so on top of it looking [ __ ] fine they upgraded my torch game big-time man [ __ ] the red ones looking all sharp and the black one black and green ok I'm sorry take me this long to get started I press through the gun line but anyway cleaning to do just quit and buy a little bit of cleaning I mean we're gonna collect some dry sip and I don't use I don't use another banner or parchment or anything I prefer to work on stainless steel for a number of reasons number one parchment um you know all static electrons if you notice like when you're in a plastic bag and you have a little bit of shake left and it just spreads itself evenly all over the walls of the bag we could you static electrons are on the outside of the back that's the way that's where they're physically placed that's not really important with or wow that matters because with stainless steel if there happens to be any static it would have to be of course on the other side of the object or the side of the surface that I'm using um it's just uh that's a little deeper electromagnetic really we're getting into we're getting into physics now and oh my god chemistry is hard enough for me ladies and gentlemen and the physics is theoretical but the fun is real you better believe it but god damn that is uh that's not just easy-peasy having fun and I'm just doing a little extra white beauty I don't know I was packaging some things and then I'll just got a couple little daddy spots um so anyway there's a trifold reason there cleanliness number one because I can get stainless steel very sterile and yes I mean very sterile that's hilarious because either is or isn't but in a non c1v1 laboratory environment where I'm not completely Thai backed up and everything obviously I run the risk of contaminant it just is what it is so to combat that as much as possible we glove up we're clean our stainless steel by putting a little bit of liquid and wiping on it just a liquid actually does uh literally do that done the movement of the static electrons if there's any static on the table right now this house is it's dry out here the barometric pressure is high rocketed right now it is a static environment if I was to dry sift onto a bunch of pieces of parchment like this when I go to pick up pick it all up I mean my god it would be it's just a lot harder to collect um I do have a card somewhere around here but it's my old Montana ID so I got to make sure that down okay so let's get our little feet out and buy a little jar gonna make this possible for us I am not using material screen tonight and the reason I'm not using that tonight is because I am only after we're not doing the material I'm getting ready to bounce here and get her to dress it it's going to be further processed it'll be washed and to see how what kind of hash I can get off of it after this which I'm sure I'll have a lot because we're not going to be it uh but the reason I'm not using my top screws cuz I'm really only going anything that stays above this I want to put back in the bag anything that lands on here I'm going to use this screen Jesus Christ Carlo and Jamie I don't know how I didn't just break that leg anyway then I'll use this screen and my carting technique to actually see or sift the resin heads and then what we have waiting for us down here we'll make some [ __ ] and fire hash hash brazo or hash we'll see and if anybody cares the string we're going to sift tonight is yep the string goes in that sangria it's uh very familiar with with the growers that I work with right now is this amazing and this is one of the cultivars that he grows that is just phenomenal absolutely phenomenal looks like we got a couple people in the room let me hit the other side the camera here yo Joe what's up Stephen um no I didn't have to I started making them in college as a matter of fact but I think my background in chemistry helps because I am I'm one of the few extract artists that I know that I it's not a bragging point it's just the fact I can make every consistency of rosin you have ever seen I can I mean I can make rosin jam and rosin sauce and I'm gonna I got a bunch of it's City Hall behind me right now a right behind camera everything solvent lessly I can wash pretty witty high-quality hash I don't think I'm the greatest water hash washer or maker yet that's something that I will get better and better at but I can certainly make some very very high quality hash and I can make some very very high quality rosin and I can do some really funky things with that rosin on a press so that is just gasless and hydrocarbon free or solvent let's work my back ground in chemistry gives me the ability to not only do those things that we did in the 90s when I when I was in college but because I have a background in chemistry I can work with hydrocarbons safely so not only can I do everything that you whatever want to do with these things or let's see let's flip you back here can I flip you back [ __ ] it those that thing yeah that's a big ol gallon milk right there that guy anyway um so aside from getting every you know dialing in processes obviously I can safely use hydrocarbons and by that I mean active or passive closed-loop systems I am very very very familiar with vacuum purging essential oils and resins ovo resins to be specific to purge them free by part per million 0 ppm of their residual solvents and then of course now that's something that you can you can learn how to do pretty easily operating a closed-loop system especially some of the newer ones that are very automated can be pretty pretty simple or at least you can learn it within a couple months or something kind of thing you know and with it within a couple months you'll be putting out some fire when I started making oil we didn't have any of that stuff we had like I got like picture this bong except there's no bomb here at the bottom this is just like that's what the top end looks like and the other end comes to like a nipple and you turn that upside down and I mean the guys that were that didn't really didn't know what they were doing were just blasting with can butane at that point not even distilling their can of butane and then using clean Eugene but so aside from the fact that I can I know what I'm doing and I know my way around the laboratory because of my education I also I've also had the ability to kind of grow with the industry and always sort of stay ahead of it by the time they started producing even close to automated closed-loop systems around 2014 or so I was so used to passively recovering and that's just recovering my butane with nothing but temperature no pumps or anything like that that uh you know it's it's just it's been easy every every new thing that has come about whether it's been something that I've stumbled on or developed on my own or just seen it has been very easy for me to emulate because of my and aside from all those things it makes people take you a little more seriously when I of course then the next thing they want to know is like well yeah if you say you went to school or you say this and what you're kicking - look let's talk some chemistry and they want maybe they Google a couple questions or whatever for you out of [ __ ] no or maybe they really are chemists so they know what to ask you to see if you actually have an idea of like what what isomerization is or what decarboxylation truly is what it is to break off of a molecule and then of course the final thing I was going to say with my education that that my education provided for me is something that a lot of people in this industry either cannot do or it's one of the only things they do and again I can I make everything solvent list that you've ever seen any bras in our house rosin or hash I make any BHO that you've ever seen shatter crumble batter diamonds saw all of it and I can also not only run a short path distillation but a short bath distillation unit but I can also fractionally distill so when you're a short path to sailing you're you distill all the cannabinoids into one solution so then it's you know 97% THC and 2% other cannabinoids 99% cannabinoids great distillate I can then take that and with the proper head I can fraction that distillate and break the cannabinoids apart actually molecularly separating each compound within it to a point of pure liquid THC that's not the kind of thing that you just pick up in a garage I know I really really went off the chain there with Stevens question but um I felt like it was a good one but no you don't have to if you want to be a guy that wears every [ __ ] hat there is to where you might want to take a couple classes and if you're not a fan of taking classes then you might want to hire me for a consultation www 710 extraction is dot-com shameless plug right no I'm just kidding here we go what's up UK strange what's up bill annoy what's up Danny Brizard what's up Braden hey as my homie lifts and shaker you know what's up you know what's that man dog shut up all right you must be new brother I don't I don't really shut up homie and honestly if it wasn't for the fact that there's a couple other homies in the room right now that I'm gonna get this done for um Oh UK I'm not gonna send it homie I'm gonna bring it with me [ __ ] I should have said that I mean either way I want you know I want to come busy you all on hash you all the [ __ ] out but homie I uh if it wasn't for everybody else in here I probably just take like 20 minutes right now and tell a story about like the first time I tried to wipe my butt and didn't do a good job and ended up heaven stinging butt cheeks walking around middle school or high school that's not like a good story for you guys ah but yes so I uh what's up tell me what is your process for making those rods and diamonds very simple I take rosin right I think the vinyl mask whatever it is and I press it into rosin I let that butter I don't have a jar of that to show you once I have buttered rosin I then do a mechanical separation that gives me gh CA isolate inside of the bag when it's fully finished and what I pull off of that is the turkey infraction very much like the way you separated in a hydrocarbon crash in a jar Tech BHO after I take and this is some odor be great please the crystals these are why these are so much darker when these crystals right here are melted they are or when this THC a is melted down to crystalline it will be well crystalline but much much lighter in yellow and even almost white so once I've separated it into these two then with some pretty extreme temperatures I melt this into here and then I recombine as as the patient desires or as I see fit I mean by how much what what you know by how much of a syrupy infraction I get how much yield I get on the ice isolate that's it what setup do you recommend for a gainer to start an extraction be the shadow rock etc um so if you're beginning and depending on what's taking in but she's I don't know I was trying to think of [ __ ] anything [ __ ] to say that's all I could come up with anyway uh what's that we got here honey tubes you know me so for a beginner honestly and it shattered ax etcetera that of course sounds like pho so if you're if you're absolutely only interested in a pho or being able to make shatter and wax and being able to get 20 and 30 percent yields which is totally understandable part of the reason why that's my with my first specialization you're gonna need a closed-loop system and you can get small ones you know a one-pound closed-loop unit with the recollection vessel and you need some buckets and some dry ice and and a little hot plate or a source of warm water or hot water and if you are completely unfamiliar then I would reach out and hire someone like me for a consultation to help you to walk you through that process it can be dangerous people do blew them blow themselves up however sorry about that if you're not trying to necessarily or have to make shatter or BHO or wax I make rosin batter rosin sauce with diamonds in it that you see here GAC isolate the crystals the terpene sauce all of that is made here on this wroth impressed so it's a you know it's safe and if you're a beginner and you don't have much of a chemistry background then I think that's probably where you want to go bro we got 20 people in the room my belonging Bowl [Music] last time I bought getting water on plan um no I didn't forget it we got the truth check setup for later but I don't have any new hash or anything I've only been making stuff for work so I uh I thought we'd do this all right ladies and gentlemen here we go caliber of cannabis gardener that I'm working with gross and I think I'd like to take a quick second to bring you in on that again we are gonna be running some his name is Carlo Jan kita you can't the only thing you could promise to get to get to this is this provider number and that won't do anything for you cuz there's no way you could get into the Montana this metric system but anyway this strain were running tonight or gonna try sniff this sangria and this is a reduction bag so this is completely untrained and unkept just just D foliated we'll take a look here hey cryptic can you hook up Alex with that info for me brother the wet book it on the website it's probably the best way ma'am encrypt experiment the link if he's still in the room if you can help me out yeah you guys not even a zoom no flash on this [ __ ] I'm live on YouTube I can't have flash my homie grows a reson bro rosen Destin I'm glad you made it brother sorry I have gloves on it's so hard to zoom out okay we I just pulled this out of the freezer so I'm gonna get going WW 710 extraction is calm and there is a booking option on the on my website right there on the front on the cover page and that is the best way if you've booked an appointment through the website which has the mini availability and stuff like that then I get a notification immediately on my personal cell phone we've been out of the freezer.now for mmm a little over a minute on YouTube I need to take homeys advice and just shut the [ __ ] up because again this stuff needs to be kept as cold as possible Wow you're looking good my phone's gonna come out of this thing here sorry guys give me just a second there we go I'll give you the tilt where's the tchaikovsky I know bro I can't play that and make dress up at the same time and my god you don't want to hear me trying to play it try to tchaikovsky right now it's been it's been years since I've been on a piano since I've played regularly so keeping the material as cold as possible you can see it just barely lightly bounced and this again because I have multiple strings I'm not doing a single screen quick bounce deck or anything that would be just 10 seconds of agitation and then literally collect what's on the table underneath it but it is good it is good to not overload the string with math by a master material you want a nice small amount on here a lot of people would literally just dump this whole bag out I start moving trying to move it around you're not giving yourself enough room to let your screens work and the other thing is of course when you're using your card don't do this this pushes the Cannabis down through the screen you can either go like literally at a 90 and don't even touch the screen just touch the canvas and move it around back and forth or you can go under and pick it up and bounce it back down but don't force anything through this room that's essentially it so we're gonna shake this around a little bit you guys for those of you that are like oh me they want me to shut the [ __ ] up which I get that dude I get it YouTube is it's full of a lot of videos that are that are you know that condense all the information I'm going to put in this entire livestream into like a two minute video and I I don't lay out my information like that number one because it's not fun for me and I'm not here making money I'm here trying to have fun and then number two it's very hard for people to be able to replicate what it is that you're trying to share with them or do for them when you social media condense your information so my tutorials and my channel and my whole theme has never been based on the trailer or the cut down video or the the time last video you know I mean that's just I use this is a lot of time when a lot of other youtubers will literally take this entire process and in time lapse the whole thing and turn 30 minutes into one and during those 60 seconds they'll share a little bit of information with you other than the babbling that I'm doing like right now which happens a lot but anyway I try to use as much of the time that I have throughout the entire video to share as much information as possible and into questions like we have so far a couple of them in the comments there because in that situation if I do a good job hopefully someone watching this as its archived you know I've not as a live stream just later hopefully they can get and get the same answer if they were wondering that question too and Britney of you that are watching this after the fact this is a live stream so if you'd like to watch or look what people are commenting or if you're wondering what I'm talking about or who I'm responding to you always have the option to watch the live chat if you're on your phone or any kind of a mobile device you may have to select that or open the live chat to be able to see it and then you may want to change from the well you change it from whatever it's normally set on to all messages I think it's set on like I'm most popular or something like that or I don't know how it determines that metrics but either way you if you select the little message notification a little icon there you can you can change it to watching all messages and then as you watch this live stream not live you can see what the other people are saying is there is there watching so like right now you can see people saying like shut the [ __ ] up dude alright let's see let's see what I missed that is so I'll tell you this even um I I have a very odd variance of hourly rates and I can tell you right now though just like kind of ballpark depending on whether or not it's a fit like a person-to-person I'd fly to your city or to your place or you come to me or you know and that's and that's the kind of situation where I need to obviously set a lot more time aside that's uh that gets more expensive and there are single click just telephone call consultations that I do that are the cheapest thing that I offer and then video chat or voice chat or ansari video chat like hangout or skyping and that's the most common thing that I employ employer because it's uh I'm sorry the most common thing that I deploy use because it's uh it's I talk with my hands a lot there are a lot of times they when I'm doing my consultations I'll be you know in my workspace just like this or depending on what we've talked about it and I know what your consultation is gonna be about then I'll make sure I have some jars of some stuff to show you how I did what or how I got to here and then I you know ask you to get your pen and paper out and I walk you through those steps after all you paid for the consultation but to give you a ballpark range generally maybe somewhere roughly a hundred dollars an hour could be more expensive depending on what you're looking for could be significantly cheaper depending on how much consultation you're booking and you know what kind of what kind of information you're looking for and how then in-depth of that information is but generally right around a hundred dollars an hour and I also offer half hours so a lot of people after they hear that they ask me how I came to that price well I found five different extractors throughout one it was here in Montana but throughout the Pacific Northwest Northern California Oregon Washington and one here in Montana who are all doing consultations throughout the west coast and I found the one that had the least amount of experience and he happens to have about one-tenth the amount of experience was making hash that idea he has a little less than two years where I have about seventeen years so I have about ten times his experience I took $50 off of his rate and that's how I how I came up with my number I know the amount of information I can offer I know the amount of information I have in mind I know this person very well he's a good friend and I know how much more I have to offer than he does and he does not consult for anything less than 150 and up so that sounded very expensive to me but at the same time you need to I gotta feed the hurt so I gotta be able to I gotta be able to get what any okay guys it's time switch this over I don't have a okay guys I'd like to kind of take this and then pick it up with my last little back-and-forth and then of course when we're completely finished I'm sure you've already guessed and some of you are saying I'm sure dude why are you going to all that trouble to get that let's take a little piece you literally gonna pour the same string right back on top of that you're right but that material has not been moved around the screen and completely thought out and you know been beat up a little longer you add you take your material the more particulate or plant matter you're going to get into your hash so if you can't fit all the material you're going to fit onto your screen at one time then you need to make sure you clean in between I used to call this bounces but I just call this in between sifting but I don't know I learned a lot of the terminology for a lot of what I learned how to do in college and you know a lot of the chemistry when I came around to that when I came around making hash in South South Lake Tahoe it started to do it professionally um it was really funny because I had a I had quite the education to go through to learn the hash makers terminology for a lot of you know things well now like the greatest example is decarboxylation everybody used to call that activating it yeah sure you're making your thta THC so it is psychoactive but way more specifically your oxalate your breaking the carboxyl group but as you see enough material here that we can see plenty of screen in between and it's nuts not anything crazy or heavy we're just gonna keep on gently sifting sorry about that guys implore deploy and how I card my hash and how I make use of what this is is me how I take any and doesn't to be a card it can be literally anything a piece of [ __ ] glass just don't pick something that's gonna cut your screen you know I'm saying it's essentially how I literally move the Keith around or the dry sift around on the screen to to force the screen into doing its job that makes the screen does the work if you're if you're working with hash and you're you're making the hash to be made it's not going to be quality almost all of processes like this except of course if you're going to do like some kind of a BHO crude and then into a distillation that level of refinement obviously you can you can literally go for every single thing on the plant and then clean it back up in post process not this this we need to get the highest highest quality and only the highest quality off of here if possible so that when we go to press it I don't have to say oh man why did I spend all that time jabbering on YouTube about making dry sense and had to come out all darkened or not dark really because I didn't get the [ __ ] about the color I'm talking about the flavor and with this it would be significantly darker because there would be more chlorophyll in it this is pretty fresh chemists just harvested with him in the last I'd say was in the last 30 to 40 days I'm actually could be a little own that could be like 300 could be three to four months sorry I didn't check the metric tag but regardless it's another one of my favorite things about working with this gardener he knows how to cure properly so when he does is 100 day killer on a lot of his flowers the chief and chooses to do so on among many he is still playing it in the proper temperatures and with the absence of light so that when I process it and it's 120 days old I still end up with beautiful gold and unicorn feellike terpene fractions or some beautiful nice you know light color - and I love these obviously if you don't know this already solvent which processes are going to be less attractive by that I mean a little less a little darker color then most of you hydrocarbon processes and the reason for that of course is people usually can't afford the yield that of solvent less extractions will yield you without a little bit of manipulation BHO by using pressure and a solvent will get you everything off of the plant without having to beat things up so higher yield on solvent list means lower quality if you want incredibly high quality supplements then don't ask them what their yield percentages were alright that's the only I mean then then you see some broken hearts but in my mind when you go back to enjoying that hash [ __ ] that Bobby you know and by that quality I mean like 710 laughs quality there water - [ __ ] fire man some of the best water ash I have smoked and and for those of you wondering why I call it water hash that's what they called it in Europe when I first was introduced to it but yes I'm just talking about bub wash and we call it bubble ash your America because of oh man who made bubble bags and that's that's just random but it is passion made with water water is the solvent whereas in this case bonus points for the person in the comment section that guesses what the solvent I'm using right now is it's not a screen screen is the device that I'm using the filter what's the or the filtration device what's the solvent being deployed here what's getting things through the screen I'll give you a hint it's the most natural solvent it can be used in extraction well hello looks like there's a couple of you in here sup med TAC well hello sarih be a lot cheaper to make your own what you got it [Music] yeah um be Kelly freedom I'm not sure about that company but I like freedom farm sounds they got a great name so you know I would obviously just do a little bit of research first these are specifically the BC bubbleman screens and you can't even get these measurements anymore this is 24 by 36 now I think you have to go up to 48 to get 20 to get 24 inches wide yeah anything this wide is only 18 inches so a lot of them are long very very much more rectangular this I love the shape of this one be a lot cheaper to make your own yeah I'm sure do you mean them do you mean that be a lot cheaper than to I guess maybe you mean a lot cheaper than getting a consultation sure if you are trying to not spend any money at all and make a high-quality product and that is absolutely possible it just usually takes a little more time than most people have where I come in is where people want to work that incredibly lengthy period of trial and error and just jump right into about four years or five years in which that's what I look that's my advertisement and that's basically what I can always guarantee to get you to I will get you to right about where I was after four years and four to five years of trial and error and I was making some pretty fire hash so I get it if you're sure it would be cheaper in the initial cost but is it going to be affordable for you when you are wasting or destroying material because of possibly some trial and error well maybe not maybe you already know what you're doing maybe you know it's better and then that in that situation that's why I always tell people I offer half our state maybe you're the kind of guy that knows so much of what's going on you literally just have like two or three pretty in-depth questions that you'd like to have answered thirty minutes and that 50 bucks might be the best 50 bucks you spent this year I've helped some people very recently in North yeah North Carolina that are making some some very high-quality fire right now and I've just consulting by way of video chat and of course over the phone a little bit and then aside from that there's another company I just did a consultation for that is in the valley in California sorry guys my gloves are making this impossible had to plug in phones dying another company that I consulted for in the valley that they are they specialize in CBD and CBD distillation and then of course reactors which is another you do after the CBD dysplasia process to get CBD to crystallize its see these I can't believe it you can actually distill and get to that temperature and then you can of course bring it back to CBD a or CBD crystal if they're doing very very very well if Sara's still in the chat room right now she can even tell you about the products did being at their CBD they were able to ship me a sample of everything that they made from the first run or the first couple runs after our consultation and those products are all sitting on the stair go by my TV and my chair right now and they are excellent excellent job well done I mean honestly I I thought we had someone I thought we had more work to do and well you know what I was I was getting a letter that said hey I got some stuff to send here so for those people it was money well spent this entire video but on the other hand if I were to continue to tell you the same information over and over again a lot of you guys are [ __ ] bored you move it around on the string and you don't force it through the screen also you're generally as quick as you can beat without making a mess so I think your canvas doesn't it's still a song as I pick this up it still feels cold in the hand not as cold as it did when I first started sniffing but you want to move as quick as possible now obviously for for Hollywood sick the next step here would be finishing cleaning the screen off are you getting it completely cleaned up very very completely cleaned off and taking it and everything that's on this lid over here and putting it all back in the back and then of course we put that bag underneath here whatever Ben it goes cleanup is important as you're going throughout the lab are you a public contaminant but we're shooting a little livestream video a little tiny crisis not even a huge amount of biomass over here maybe yeah I don't know maybe not very much anyway this is my little bounce technique I do this in all four corners from the corner to the towards the center make sure that I've kind of let anything that might be stuck in the screen go in or on the next screen and now we're gonna start our work if the work is all to be done on the next screen down so that we can enjoy what is on the next screen below it again probably would sake take this anyone out of the room there we go now I will not be now I won't have any issues with contaminant let cetera let's see you guys oh that's as high as I can get you high as I can get you pun intended right met THC my THC you know I love it Oh Josh boom I love it Destin I love it Joe what's up Daniel Sarah you knew was that oh I liked it erosion could yes and of course erosion being caused by gravity though because obviously things would not erode if there wasn't a force pulling things yep I'm sure look at all we don't have to be particle physicists or theoretical or string theory but any you know we don't have to be higher but the world is flat I'm just kidding I brought you guys in here a little closer on the screen as you can tell because I just wanted you guys to see the sifting um it's it's actually um good question sorry guys I I just wanted you guys to see what's happening so I used a 160 micron plant matter or if you call with I like to call them work screen just to work on top of and then that is all that's in the other room and I'll pack up that canvas again and this what I'm on top of right now is that 120 micron and then below is a 74 so what we're going to do right now is use the 120 micron screen to clean up what we have on top of it and get that down very very very very dry Josh very dry and frozen for over 24 hours in a deep freezer oh thank you Sarah tell me it would be a lot cheaper for you to make your own screens these were incredibly expensive the reason why I chose to go with these is because for a long time I used my own screens for Sarah [ __ ] what six or seven years I just used my own screen it was way easier if I could just continue to buy fabric and it was what it was when I just went made the decision to pull the trigger on these these are such a godsend because they are so high-quality and I can't pick it up and show you but the way that the screen the way that the micron is fastened onto here does not come loose and it's evenly fastened all the way around and god I've been waiting to have an excuse to use this word in a video evenly fastened all the way around so that the screen is perfectly taut I love Mike Myers anyway with the three being perfectly taught that preserves our efficiency of a micron value helping to maintain an exact 120 micron throughout the entire screen even when I'm doing things like which of course is putting stress on the screen yes it would be cheaper but you know your screens as these are which you know they're not not impossible but if you're like me time is money and I would much rather pay a hundred dollars for someone to show me how to do it the right way then spend six months or even spend one week or even spend one day going back and forth and learning it through trial and error now that's only true for certain things in certain parts of chemistry in certain parts of our process trial and error is absolutely the way to go but once you are at the point where you're making hash or extract production levels or in patients are counting on you you know they've had the opportunity to just trial and error and trial and error and trial and error there's something that you or you'll find yourself a lot of job but as you guys can probably tell our little pilot project here is getting smaller and that's that's not because we have spread out but it's successfully this creative working now I've worked a lot right here so I'm going to move over in this area and then to this area and then to this area obviously if you stay in one section of the screen I mean I'm not in a freezing cold room right now so the higher-quality heads could absolutely start to come up and get caught in this room which that's a good idea to do your little technique at the end of your initial shift at the end of your flower agitation do your mouse technique at the end of that and then throughout your carding technique so there's one corner we've got just starting into the second quarter and we did a balance so we'll do about four little sections of card in here with this but if you want to go the house is starting to act a little differently see it's literally it's greasing up to the point in its beginning it's becoming a solid that's you might even have just heard it that's a great time that's a great great song when you're as your party if your house was already starting to grease up to the point that you could take it out and smoke it in a bowl that's why I tell people you know I'm sure you want to try this noise and I always tell people not if you're gonna send it to me in the mail because yes I want to try and yes yes it sounds tasty but I don't want to hear that you literally lost your freedom over this country I've been sifting and talking and sifting and talking so you know that me I don't even have a ring out or anything we got the old school ball right there and we're making some old school house all right guys we are check out the size of our pile of dry set now ladies and gentlemen remember the size it was when we started if you don't go ahead and use your the bar at the bottom meter screen whatever they call that ticker go back and look at the size of picado tricep when we started when we first picked up the price now do I want to keep one until this completely gone no but I do have one section of Street last thing we need to do after we play around with our last section let's just do a little quick spotlight inspection and then of course it's just - um sometimes I use my scope it's just a 45 40 40 X little pockets you can see whether or not you've gotten down to the point that you've gotten your head and what you have here are some pistols some stocks stock ends well no we're not done it'll be honestly the only thing that's probably gonna be left when we're done here are these pieces of hash this is let me put you guys in here real quick on the quality of a hat show you what's happening as we are sifting there's my sift file can you see the chunks starting to harden up look at the color of them I mean they're whitish grey gorgeous gorgeous sorry guys I was listening to uh Conan O'Brien needs a friend and the Billy Eichner episode on the way up here in [ __ ] funny where a death alright so I I'm not gonna take the time to bring you guys in on the light inspection but the light inspection is showing so much of a head percentage still and that's just the glistening this obviously you can see much plant matter and you can even kind of see what like the stock but the amount of listen that I still have is exactly why if I don't hurry up it's just going to chuck up and then it will never get through the screen which that's of course what we're going to do with throw this bigger chunk back on the other thing of course 74 micron screen of course as you can see it's been elevated so that stocks and things that of course would have a smaller circumference than an actual glandular trichomes head can fall through under the table depending on the just move the move to move them around until there's nothing left but the pieces of hash the greased down or greased up whatever you prefer to call it while we were drafting and for those of you that are wondering no that is not lint these are what we call angel hairs in the hash world just a little sticky sticky and sometimes they stretch when they look a lot like little hair so a little pieces of lint see how that one looks like it's got a little piece of house on it peach the hash on I can't talk sorry that's got to be brutal trying to look at that so that is not going to go through a screen ladies and gentleman that's gonna go that's just one of my [ __ ] lungs right now like right goodbye right now I mean like right after this next night god damn look how much I was stuck to the card look how my chunks were stuck to the card looks like [ __ ] rock they look like little pebbles anyway umm that's going to be a nice little [ __ ] snapper yeah this car is so gummed up I can't wait to use this to board an airplane somewhere alright ladies and gentlemen I would also since we've done this amount of work on this screen also this is another thing we're gonna smoke this by itself so rather than let this contaminate anything else or even worse be wasted I just picked the screen up and strained it up so that nothing in that direction you clean off our card as best we can if necessary you can use ethanol wipes or ISO but if you do that you need to let it sit on a heating mat or a pad of some kind for at least 10 to 20 minutes so that this can get warm enough that it doesn't melt and you also completely evaporate the isopropyl or ethanol ethanol won't hurt you but it'll [ __ ] up the taste of everything I so can actually not only be unpleasant but it can [ __ ] up okay so I just finally tapped in there right about the I've been gone to school for some of this and then of course having done this professionally for two decades the amount of knowledge that is common for me is certainly not common for everybody else or most people that aren't hash makers or chemists so if I had to find where my voice is heard and where it's most appreciated and in case any of you are wondering yes the little boy inside of me is jumping up and down right now because that [ __ ] pilot ship is gorgeous sorry I can't get you a better picture than that right now again the phone is almost dead it's the quality of our finest product damn no wonder that's greasing down already holy [ __ ] yeah I can't see it this well with my eyes I have to bring it over to the camera to see it like that um anyway I'm incredibly excited because wow that's how fast that greased up whoa so I'm incredibly excited number one because I think that this is one to make some amazing cash profit but I'm also incredibly excited because of this much quality or this many heads there's always going to be some goodness underneath and there's that little bit of goodness we've got right there now what we have next is we're going to see we brought it and how do we determine that by getting a weight of the actual amount of tricep and after we press it in a 15 micron bag ladies and gentlemen yes that's 74 micron dry snipped yes I could press it in a 70 micron bag and it would technically filter that as things warm up and aspects are pressed and stretched you don't get that good of a filtration I don't recommend anybody using a higher micron than 25 for any kind of if you're gonna use 25 micron it a micron rosin bag it needs to be 90 micron or larger head size or at ninety micron or larger pool you know your nightmare your 120 micron when you get down to the 73 micron and smaller and honestly 7300 up to 89 so you're 73 pull what this is this is 74 through 119 right yep this is 74 all the heads in that pile right there in theory except for the ones that we've gotten to go through the bottom you don't care are between 74 and 119 microns I am only going to skyrocket its quality by filtering it in a 15 micron back if I wanted to fit in a 37 micron bag I would get much more yield but that's not going to help me determine the quality because how could it all that's one could show me is that I got a bunch of Keith or a bunch of farmers friend Keith Nick did not melt and did not press into rosin by doing this with our press turn it on and put your place together bring in here book which you can see put the plates together up like that immuno heat up in equilibrate much faster all right so let's load the let's finish loading this 15 micron baggie here and then we'll get a tare weight with the scale and we'll see exactly how much dry see if we collect and then we will press it and we'll see what kind of rosin we get or you know what kind of you'll beget figure out our percentages from there telling us what kind of quality we got now before I pulled this up or anything I always look underneath because every once in a while depending on the string or whatever sometimes what makes me underneath in this situation I can see the sift on the table now [ __ ] look at it on camera you guys could see it right away so I can tell you already right now that a level of just just that level of yield we're probably gonna be putting that in the bag and yes that's going to lower our percentage or our percentage of return but because of the quality that this sip is or most of this is or some of this thickness it's going to be overall yield so we don't waste that [Music] there's some heads in there but you know it's not like amazing or anything so let's see what we got here to start with if this is only this is a tiny amount but if it's just tiny as I think it might be little abacus yeah we got an eighth the dry stuff in here I'm gonna go ahead and put the zero 273 micron in there as well and the reason I'm going to put that zero 273 mic on in there well it's exactly what I've just explained to you guys this is going to hurt my overall percentage but as you can see this will absolutely produce some rosin that [ __ ] that's not bad at all actually you do have my I do my spot check with the flashlight and then when I look at it on the camera I go like [ __ ] I wonder how many times I've said to myself like I know you're good if I would have just taken a second and looked at it through my camera lens oh [ __ ] press that [ __ ] okay see where we are here I get a 4 this is the weight of our bag I believe we're not zero zero yeah that makes more sense okay I was wondering how I had an eighth okay three point two three point one so this is literally almost exactly well we got some battery issues we've got some battery issues okay so the only thing that's going to stink about this now is because I've added my zero to zero to 74 sift two here there will be some that is actually there's going to be some stocks in here some tiny little bits of particulate a lot of it I've kept from static and things like that but there will be some particulate that will make it through our 15 microns hole having said that what are you gonna do so this is a very high quality very very high quality I can tell by the way it's acting inside of the bag already and by that I'll just show you its greasing up enough to the point that it's sticking to the sides already and all I really did was just push on right there oh nice little brick in here so maybe we'll get it and the other thing is I want to make sure to be reasonable with I'll crack the bag is because I want it to be able to expand sorry oh yeah I wanted to be able to expand and be able to get all my deals without blowing out and without double bagging because when we have this much sip depress jesus man I'm not gonna I mean it would just it seems silly to me to double back so point you over here that was pleasant anybody else get a seizure from that [ __ ] shake there wow it's crazy how far away the camera is here okay okay guys so we're gonna give my press another minut or to my bag you said yeah upside down when that cell remains folded Jesus yes I like that's why I long YouTube videos like this um okay these are equilibrating it very nicely the temperatures are starting to even out I don't have them set to 175 because I'd like to get a decent you press quick and we can press around 180 which is hot brash in my book but I get I give really great yields and if I press fast I can usually do okay in the case with dress it with water or bubble hash I'd like to present a very low temperature and take it slow and in the case of flour as many of you know I press it about this temperature or even a couple degrees colder and I take it very slow not in a rush to get anything done only thing I'm gonna rush to do is make a fire that's it don't know if you guys can see that or not but that's what I'm gonna rush to do alright I feel like you can't really see a whole lot there so that's do you like here's alright while the screen 37 of you hello hello and thank you for all the 10 likes hmm love Kelly feeling fine I was talking about making my own dress just kidding oh oh sorry buddy I'm sorry you guys are so far behind [ __ ] yeah dude Japan's killing it and I got that new [ __ ] tank replacement atomizer for it now it's bull I'm gonna teach you oh ha what stops a bear med THC Ontario is in the house thank you Sarah for answering everybody for all this [ __ ] I take like the pillow I'm going enjoy all day every day yes you can if you don't have strings you have one and Sarah can share with you a lot of times before I had these strains not only did I use my bubble bags there were times that it was so inconvenient I would cut my bubble bags all up just so I could use the bottoms of them or so I can wrap the bottom of it around a frisbee that I'd cut the center out of you know saying little frisbee I would use as a frame if you can see I can see you've been inside the cookie I must be buggin I'm a little bit lit you guys are if you're catching on to that you're absolutely right I can bail I fully agree with you as far as best overall all the way for not only yield but for quality is to wash with water dry properly whether you have a pharmaceutical free driver doesn't really matter that's just gonna change the amount of time it takes you to dry things but if you are properly drying your water ash and properly storing it and then pressing it all for I don't believe in the term full spectrum because I keep the chlorophyll out of it but for what I refer to as a broad spectrum rosin down the wrong pipe so yes for a broad-spectrum rosin love it 80% of tri contrast method is 27 yep yep agreed fully agreed you get much higher yields my dress if this this won't be staggering there are some bubble hash presses that I do where I get 85 and 87 percent yield on the hash of course not from flour to not that dry said my handle I'm just trying to get a little bit up here in the comments so I can oh when you guys think of the new Chi can you guys see yeah is wearing this the other day and my little girls were like daddies that's you yeah metaphorically bush trees baby push them trees all right so I fully agree with you my choice to do this this way tonight is because I left the house and came to work some hours ago with the idea that I was not going to [ __ ] with social media at all and I decided give and take but to just kind of give give give give which is what I get out of these live streams I basically get to dump my thoughts on to a camera and those of you who hear them hear them and those of you that get pissed say things like shut the [ __ ] up and leave you know like homie in the beginning which if you're still here dude that's amazing if you're not I totally understand I was probably not operating at your speed and I get that all right here we go let's see if I can get caught up here we go let's see that they did it did you do to Jim Jim Jim Jim you make well rosin hash yes absolutely edibles are really I think all of our favorite way to to make our our waste reusable yep you're absolutely right um the flour rosin it's a way for me to press it and get a little bit better of a yield from flour to melt then I do with the water hash and of course the purpose for that is not for when I'm making a product it's going to be a jar of rosin in the end the purpose with that is when I am trying to produce as much rosin butter as possible so that I can pull the infraction I thought it and so that I can isolate the taste yeah a lot of people are shocked by my flour rosin comes in right around 88 to 90 percent to you CA I get great great returns on my separations what is up 710 Daniel II nothing will go to waste you know it yep saris more 13 hit it right there hit it on the head all of that is happening and that's what that's what all these different jars are inside I mean nothing gets wasted if it's a B or it's a name - product it gets separated for its THC a if it's a an a product that's going to be separated towards th da it's actually the THC a is a bonus that's actually separated for its turbine fraction but anything that is not of a superior quality and I'm a [ __ ] snobby [ __ ] when it comes to my hash but anything that's not of the superior quality that's separated mechanically and and/or used in Apple's Oakley that all kind of clear things up there Oh 7/10 yeah I feel you homie I wish I could honestly I wish I could take a little bit of autonomous break Sarah don't hold me to that but I wish I could take a little bit of a tolerance break because then I'd like to get super super high you know yeah you'll feel after that break it's always a way I know I can't even remember other than like when I'm [ __ ] in like sitting overnight in a holding cell or some [ __ ] I'm smoking everyone I used to be able to say things like ten years ago and now it's like Oh Daniel you know especially being oh no I'm sorry I thought I was getting ready to throw you but the econ man but yeah you know what's up we love our economics over here she breaks are always getting 37 is a decently large room of people I thought so too right no one on the screen said he'd agree with us with the car yes so um now why I don't scrape against the other side it's because that's what I'm so sorry you guys I got lost I babble and I lose my train of thought what I was trying to get to with the static being on the outside of these static electrons being me on the outside of your plastic baggies your static electrons are on the outside of whatever working surface you're working on so I'd like to collect the rosin or the sorry that's dry sipped on the stainless steel surface because it's easier there's less static to deal with if any at all the underside of your screens have static there's that it's absolutely there and because some parts of the game plan are so so so so [ __ ] sorry about that so so so light when dry [ __ ] this right here is light enough to be picked up by that static and this is lighter so by the way that's what's gonna get wasted that little piece I just drop it so this right here is definitely I don't have to get picked up by that static I do my snapping and bouncing and flicking and all that to get as much as that is like you get and then I collect all that underside step and keep that in a bigger [Music] the little jar that I have and I just call this like my farmers grade dry sift this is everything that gets cleaned up after I do every any one of these and I have enough of this now that I'll probably have a little mixed rain press to do some time soon yes full easy and another thing about the other the number one screen bros that I don't know if you noticed or not that when I'm going through this there's so many of those small pieces of particulate around the end after I get done clean mouth [ __ ] sorry guys when I'm doing this there's so many pieces of little you know trim and particulate around the end here and again the static does it picks a lot of that especially when I move my tray to adjust my tradies or adjust the jars under my trays anything like that so that's why I stopped doing the scrape underneath and including it in what I'm going to press just because I don't want to squeeze anything green if I don't have to when I'm pressing flower it's either for economical reasons to provide patients with a melt that is incredibly affordable or to make butter for separation agreed a great few more steps and again this is dry sift that I just wanted to make so that I have something to enjoy for what's up stoney how you doing so they have something enjoy enjoy for tonight's truth tech says you know what's up baby AMA I'll take the 37 woman and leave Oh Sam hey I like you I mean two girls will break you sure will rather take them someone who knows 710 sigil 17th century digital boy my two girls were born on the same goddamn day twin twins rubber baby Estonia cheers to you too brother oh thank you um no I didn't I will have to go check that out I love Matias content um I know a lot of people find him kind of uh I think like this tastes fuller or something or they find maybe but I just think the dudes [ __ ] funny man he's funny and he's having a good time so I'm down with it and Wow to you two guys I feel like I'm so far behind all right here we go yes sativa and indica do have different sized stripes and that's a very good indication or definition or explanation for what the term sativa and indica are actually good for they are used to describe physical characteristics of the plant and of course physical is chemical characteristics chobe profiles etc but not too they're not terms that are used to describe psychotropic not necessarily gonna help you study or some dumb [ __ ] uh anyway giggity thanks max what's up Greg hashtag Greg reclaim absolutely same plant two different same plant suitable if it's the exact same plant and are you harvested to top let's say you have to the the top of it because the lowers were just a little bit unfinished and then five or six days later you harvest the bottom part of it as it's finished you're going to have two different size try it's just from that and of course if you're running different phenotypes which other they're all going to be different oh yeah brother you know all you need is a set of screens just get yourself set screens or even get like one screen that's 120 micron or you know what I mean or 90 micron or something like that so you can at least I don't know I would want at least two cuz I like to catch things in between like if I was you I get like a 74 and a 120 and then something to sift off the top you know but that's just me tell me where you gonna tell Stoney about I wanted now to salve I love press Rollins you know s'more with that knowledge more than knowledge yeah absolutely great point how could a plant be completely finished in every section of that plant this is how the gardener or the expert gardener decides when to harvest he's looking over his plant with his scope and decides when the most of it is perfectly finished or ripened if you will without letting it get to the point where all of it is finishing and some of the first stuff that finished is starting to degrade and produce TBN let's see so CBG is the precursor to a CBD and THC THC is the precursor to CBN you and me both study but Stoney Baker Otis rookie in the league baby everyone is at some point Daniel knows what's up Thank You 7-10 thank you appreciate it guys hey Stoney you're the boss Tommy I'm just I just got a stupid [ __ ] camera I appreciate you guys I'm so [Music] sorry hi Anna hello Sarah you do got to make it work with what you got wait wait he's just coughing over the tree puts trees baby okay that's that that was always copying over the tree he's pushing that tree baby push trees oh we fell down to 29 I guess I should cancel the live stream I have to have people watching me and validating my bath I have to I need value I can get it from nowhere else social media is it for me exactly Sal they either have the passion that they don't whether yes I didn't I sure do brother I do it in two ways rosin and a Terp sauce and one is a slow decarboxylation to get the consistency that I like into a nice drip that's very nice because it not only has a very high terpene content and flavor but it's also very very high in THC a and a broad spectrum of the Kaminoans when I am going for an incredibly high I just skyrocket even turkey analytics I do a mechanical separation and when I do a separation the just reeks I've only had one of those tested so far but it did come back just under 20% 19 plus percent overall terpenes it was a super super while yes I sure did that's right no I'm sorry sangria service are you right it's more you got it it was sangria you ready or no wait we're both wrong so we're both moms for the Cure that went into that that eventually the last time I wanted that little jug over there so the news Terp sauces mimosa too late break time I love it I love it come on man you got oh [ __ ] I can't catch that man you and nobody ever has to retract a message unless I mean if you want to hear whatever it's all you I love it gravity is dissolving any on top of it no these are just what I collect rosin this one is a collection of rosin sauce or a turkey fraction of rosin and then of course I mixed back in a large percentage of my thta chunks I left some of them obnoxiously large as you can see and I also powderized out some of it so that it would have a very royal jelly like consumed and this is literally just waiting up here for me to collect some more Robin aye that's another work to do so nope just sitting up on top of the press so that they'll be room temp to Gram bein 10 degrees ambient warmth so that when I go to collect and store in them they will they'll the consistency manipulation will take place for me without having to use any sort of excess temperature and by keeping that lid on tight I can get the rosin to butter very very easily without sacrificing any sort of the terpene evaporation or losing any Terps if you will it's because of your other purse I can buy in Canada gang honestly homie rah-rahs impress New York and the reason I think that is because everything that's an open cage design I can get into the back of it I can get into the sides of it all that and everything on this press has a lifetime warranty and because of the open cage design as soon as something breaks on it you take it apart you just take that piece off and send it back to them any sense you do you don't have to ship this press all over the place this that that's this press that press that you're looking at I will be pressing rosin on for possibly the rest of my life it has a lifetime warranty why not and it's so [ __ ] affordable that's the ten-ton I think it's around 700 and his 2 ton is around 400 400 [ __ ] dollars for a very very adequate rhotic rosin press that's just my opinion get up hit that top 7 777 Mohawk ww7 extraction is calm and there is a section on the website there for you to go ahead and fill out or book an appointment thank you s'more then get he playing on a line install what am I missing South Canadian Tire tents hey I like it rather di why you know what I'm saying that that might actually be your best bet because you probably can build it yourself for even cheaper than this if you don't have time and you want to have a warranty on all your parts because of course if you build it yourself as soon as anything breaks on it you have to pay to fix it if you want to spend a little bit more money and have it warranties that's the price I'd go with right there and if you want a little more power than that he has a 20-ton zero and if you wait one more month the 20-ton is coming out in a larger plate model those are three by fives the 20-ton that I'm getting next month has five by seven inch plates on it and I'm gonna put that right next to that unit and we'll uh we'll dial them both in together I like it Canadian Tire ten son Jack I love it he's got a DIY man absolutely and you can order the aluminum bar stock and with already with pre up of completely fabricated with the pre-drilled holes and everything and then you just need your femoral couplers and if I'm understanding this correctly the heat plate may come with all that already all like in a package with instructions on how you put it in and install it and you just kind of like like when you're watching Rambo set the the putty fuse bond you got a you have to pack those diodes and make sure that the thermocouples are going to be accurate thank you Oh sixty-five entries left deal so I want to take you to transfer my miniature sauce well if I'm doing it for mechanical separation I get it inside of three hours if I'm doing it through my decarboxylation method it takes about a week and the reason for that is because I D carve it at such a low temperature it actually is the breaking of the carboxyl group is dependent upon time at that point of course me too for sure Anna you go the salesmen I like it I like it family a poor baby I got told you twins Manish one Saturday morning I had a girlfriend that's Saturday night out of family for how much was the pressed $5,000 yes $700 $800 if you want I think it 775 if you want to get with a bunch of collections and a big plate and a ton of bags up a mold which i think is awesome if you're going to press hash frozen and you're going to dry it and store it the way that I prefer I don't think you really need a mold for it I prefer to keep it powdery appreciate you guys that's how I do carboxylate rosin and I do that so that it will of course be psychoactive and can be ingestible that is runny so that it can be you know it can be applied in a cartridge or it can be used as a sauce or to flavor TS yeah but even more importantly than that the decarboxylation has to take place because if i th see a rich rosin and cartridges number one the atomizer in most cases is not efficiently vaporizing it or be carboxylate in it so that you're going to get as high as you should but after some time you build up a little bit of pressure and that lemons will crash out in your cartridge I I got look at my Instagram there you have to scroll down a while in a long time since that's happened to me but this is some of the first times I accidentally grew diamonds inside of cartridges so that's the the purpose on that decarboxylation and I cut up nut smashers a great press very very similar in quality and different I believe between the two is and I really like my homie of rosin press New York so it seems like they both have great teams and great customer service the things that are comparatively different are that generally rosin press New York offers a little bit more pressure not to my shows like a one ton press I think a NES 5 or 7 here's our to 10 and 20 and these are significantly more affordable the cheapest nut Smasher rosin press cost about as much as the most expensive rosin press New York progress and yes no smashers a bigger but do you give a [ __ ] if there's a horse on your shirt that is playing polo and such a fancy white way or do you give a [ __ ] if your shirt keeps you warm and it's nice and company so you know that's what it's about absolutely what was like no um specific terpene volatility or that's how we know the drastic press is gonna go up gonna go well I just had my little jack stand upside down line and I probably should have my hand under there cuz if that falls good off well how's it going to dump out it's like a frickin oh that's wet through the bag alright again not doing any kind of not administering any kind of a double bag directional fold anything we are just pressing this [ __ ] this is a small enough full river that I can just monitor where the back of the paper is without even having to [Music] yeah he's monitoring the back already okay with half a sentence key I thought let it gel let it displace let it do its thing 800 bucks for your nook Smasher og and what's the amount of pressure that it will deliver oh yeah that stinks what about like also if you have a blowout can you get behind your plates easily and sasquatch frozen breast I hate that thing besides an end back and complete are completely caged and closed in and you like you put your parchment in the front and you better hope you don't [ __ ] anything up because if your rosin doesn't come out the front it's like a [ __ ] whether they call it scavenger hunt there you go just Gavin I'm trying to get you rather than what you think about the dead breast five by five five nine seven great great ooh love it great pair I don't I don't like the idea of not having it warranty but I'll bet you're gonna put that in this is two ammo junkies comment I don't like the idea of it not being warranty but I'll bet you're gonna put it together for so cheap that it doesn't matter I have no offense tre okay it wasn't put on a pity you know I ran at the president three of those deer that's what's up that's what's up sad that's it that's a nice low temps cages are very nice there's just a little price we are one minute two minutes into rest now we've given just enough time for everything to start gelling just a little bit and so now we're gonna bring down some pressure and honestly I cannot stress this enough I am NOT one for yield I'm going for a quality product to smoke tonight in tonight's truth check live session and considering this is a two hour livestream will spending some time I'm [ __ ] YouTube today man damn and I don't know if you guys are gonna be able to see anything coming out of there or not it's the back is pretty far back there bag of keep I think I'm gonna get and I'm hoping for a 35% you I'd like to see 50 or more but you know everything is this specific sangria it's not bad but I'm not in love it if this wasn't a half-frozen I would probably just let this butter and then mechanical separate but because this is from a tricep and from a hash it will it'll smell just fine there we go now right now our oil is displacing let's put some pressure on it we're three minutes and 45 seconds into our press so we really need to get done this pretty quick we at least minutes and anything this needs to be off the plate with within five minutes then that is Betsy that's a little long to be honest with you not everything goes now I need just a teeny tiny little thing to cover up this hole here we go [Music] so how many of you are thinking to yourself dude are you really going to go by when you do again right after this yeah and for those of you that are here if I see you over there to you Bobby Rock go ahead we're within 35 30 seconds now but I want to ring out oh [ __ ] let's do this I'm just over here with the scale and I'm going and now we had three grams of sift to start with inside of this bag [ __ ] the batteries are dead like deadish so I think we had around three grams and now there's about 1.4 so I actually did get about a 50% you'll let me share this with you I was not again I'm not super excited about the coloring but because it's from a hash I'm okay with it I got some nice color buttered rosin there and again this would be significantly lighter if I had gotten my hands on this material strain before up to four months old and it's still not beautifully so that makes me think that this specific bag that I had was 737 that is for you or not but if that's easy for you I think that's significantly older than what I'm used to pressing smoke it while you listen between funny it's like all these young kids they want [ __ ] white hash and I'm going like you'd rather have white house you really would rather have white hash than that I mean you got that's the color of it let's be real no it's not white no it's not super light is it [ __ ] amazing I mean look at the butter again look at the buttered sections the stuff that buttered right on the press yep and again I would rip the dab of this with you guys but that's not for you guys this is specifically for my truth checkers for those of you that are interested in seeing if you can embarrass me our truths tech Tuesday session for those of you that don't know what that means normally that I made doesn't have to be hashed that I made but me enjoying some high-quality hash out of some of my highest quality quarts and being that it is called truth tech I three lot dab of my truths debt quartz and I tell the truth no matter what the question you can ask me whatever you want worst thing worst-case scenario is I'll say I can't answer that or I'll get us all in trouble I smoked that sue them oh you know what's up you know what's up s'more oh I'm not in apopka but we are going to D an D now you [ __ ] rock channel cap silicon nitride [ __ ] Turk perilous things are so [ __ ] expensive and they're so cool man I dropped one drop it and because I dropped it because I'm idiot because do this so cool we [ __ ] seven five five of these I'm giving two of these away at some point here on YouTube but no puffs go for me brother I like glass I don't know where to put it down oh I got a little sure Batman will cover the hash nook with that alright ladies and gentlemen I love you if you don't know that you've been lying to yourself are you just being silly you know why I'm talking like a southern man who was probably a racist but cannot be pressed in your own I agree with your brother max great winterization number three Ella Oh if there was ever a consultation on hey what's up Conrad you did make it brother we've only been live for like an hour and 50 minutes so you you're not lady I'm just kidding the good news is that I'm literally getting ready to go live again and if yes what I was just going nuts over the fact that if there was ever a consultation owed I Oh Anna some winterization info I got I had a a company fall apart in the middle of the first productor trying to produce those videos and then in a second attempt at producing those videos youtube shut me down and then in the third attempt it's shooting those videos my job literally evaporated because the company went under so god Terk girls are [ __ ] awesome and homie that just made it and for those of you all that are still here and it's children and want to keep chillin I love you too s'more let's do this damn cryptic well you know I'm coming I'm coming to Oakland like [ __ ] next week I'm gonna put like I'm just I'm going strictly to break your atomizer and then go right back on all right so if you all want to keeps moving if you all want to keep doing this let us do it let me see where we are here okay truth tech Tuesday in about as much time as it takes for me to go like this and like this in this and this and then see how much battery is on that camera and see if I want to stand right here or if I want to go sit down in the litter cheers ladies and gentlemen let's get in on this I want to see if you uh what you guys to see if there's any any melt value to the low-quality sifter that we kept out of the rosin press because we want to depress our higher quality set so run the camera here we go yeah sorry good yep see this is why we kept it out of the rather than press almost no melt value ooh what is in the bottom of there that oh that's his [ __ ] chunks that's the chunks from the 74 micron screen it's gotta be just getting the hash I'm not crazy damn but the flavor on the back end is undeniable okay ladies and gentlemen we're going to go ahead and call this baby to a close stop this thing just under two hours so you know people can watch it after I the archived it it's not inconvenient for him because most people have at least two hours to give to YouTube every day right oh sorry guys for those of you that watch the net fun I hope you learned a thing or two or at least had yes it is dope enjoy emerge bush trees baby new homie seven in the comment thread there probably didn't pick up any new information but he was here sharing some of his information with everybody so if you didn't get it from me or if nothing else just watching my dumb fat ass walk around this room and be an idiot let's hopefully at least get a good laugh out of it but that's that time ladies and gentlemen first Tuesday of every month we do truth tech Tuesday and depending on what's going on in life I'd do it on the last Tuesday of the month too and this is the last Tuesday of February so here we go I love you ladies and gentlemen I will see much for those of you that I do not see in the truth text session I get it you probably had your fill at me and for those of you that just tuned in come on right back I'll be live again in less than 10 minutes Cheers", "kbAFHgdAwpg": "yes yes before justin yeah we're in my kitchen he gets a mess a girl like that and yeah what's he doing on there with that washing machine well i did say i had another method of making uh ice hash bottle hash water extraction hash whatever you want to call it [Applause] so basically in a nutshell this is the machine doing the work now so obviously i've got a bag in there as you can see [Music] it's like a pyramid basically so it's a pyramid pack you put it with ice in it you put your trim in it i just want to use the rest of this up so i don't want it here so just get rid of this trim now we're just finished this i just wanted to just give you a quick glimpse when i show you the quality i get coming out of that unfortunately because of the amount of ice this i've uses the amount of price i needed so i'm only gonna be able to do one run so i'm gonna run it for about 20 [Music] minutes [Applause] [Applause] we are collecting trikes baby we are flexing trikes [Applause] yeah so i hope you're all well sending all my best wishes to you people like that one love to you and look out for the smoke and review on this fantastic bubble wash it's going to be going really really soon just check that out check out the coloring which is changing just from filming it just from filming it it's changed already it's just like so you can smell the weed now the weeds just a few bits of leaves i'm impressed really really impressed i'm using the purple background pyramid back basically that's what you can see there really good guys really really good the camera that looks just that way one text yeah peaceful love guys and i'll see you really really soon for another video yes yes double hash coming up wonderful", "Lpc-eiRyrG4": "what's up what's up what's up welcome back welcome to it just want to show you a little hash program that i'm throwing together here i uh filled up my [ __ ] bubble magic 20 gallon the bag is stuffed i did a layer of ice roughly 20 pounds on the bottom threw my bag in with about three pounds of trim and buds mainly all buds and then filled it up with water and topped it again with about another 15 pounds of ice and it's sitting here for about a half an hour and this system works really good uh up here is the uh timer so you can set it for increments of uh 15. uh what i'm going to be doing is running two rounds of 30 minutes probably three rounds of 30 minutes more than likely depending on how much i get out of the second run and this has a great feature on it for uh you see here on the left soft normal and hard so i set it for normal uh depending on your preference you can do whatever you want on your extraction so it's been sitting uh the great thing too so you'll see it turns up real nice stops and then reverses to the other side so yeah i'm gonna let that go for about 30 minutes and uh then it's got an auto drain here so i'll spill it off into the sink it'll drain off and the two bags that i'm working with here i basically got a 160 for my contaminant bag and a 45 on the bottom i don't catch anything in them in the middle because this is for my own personal that i basically press into rosin and i like a full spectrum rosin so all of the middle bags that you see here i actually will um uh not use any of those so nothing else better to do while you're making hash than eating some seized candy and drinking a nice bottle of woodwork so hell yeah that's what the [ __ ] i'm doing right now i'm gonna get lit i got enough ice in the icebox uh to keep this thing going so show you guys what i'm working with this is about half of my inventory that i have to run uh so basically i took the bottom layer off which was half of this bin this other half right here it uh still needs to be stripped off of the branches but then i've got some of um freedom farms uh agent orange trim i've got some other stuff that i've been keeping for hash and then like i said this is about half of what i've got to run so basically the three pounds that's in this machine now will take three runs to be done and then i go ahead and switch over and do another run so you can see this is time consuming for the amount that i've got but it's all good that's what we're here to do and uh we're gonna keep it running what i'll do is i'll give you guys an update on uh what i pull from the whole run and uh let you guys know what the total hash amount was a bubble hash that i end up getting here i'll dry it out and um and then what i'll do is i'll press it so all what i'd like to do is show you guys how much i end up getting uh from this run from this magic bubble machine bubble magic machine and then based on the amount of hash that i get uh i'll do a giveaway and you guys can guess how much rosin it produces so last year just to give you an idea my um uh my blue blue mist that i did all of the extra that i had from that i also had uh made some other different stuff from it and some batter and give some away but i ended up having about a 63 gram jar of just the blue mist so that gives you an idea of how much rosin is going to be pressed so yeah i am in the kitchen as you see nice and cold so things are a little out of array but it's all good kids are away big boss will play oh yeah hey if you guys haven't touched on that right there dude let me tell you this is a sleeper woodwork oh so good so tasty all right guys i'm gonna work on this bottle and get this run gone uh stay lifted if you got any questions about how i'm doing my hash blah blah blah feel free to leave uh the comments below i definitely will answer them i will tell you that before i do my runs i like to spray my uh my mesh screens with alcohol and then i rinse them so that way i get full flow you'll notice anybody that's done hash before you know that that's essential to keep the flow going through the bucket and on this bucket you see i cut out the bottom so this will sit in the sink and the flow will basically just dump right out make it really easy for me and uh the ice stays in the machine and then i'll run the whole bag again so that's a system that i run very simple and like i said you can add the middle bags if you want uh to separate your spectrums but i do a full spectrum i don't need to [ __ ] around with a bunch of different ones and see how they are i just kind of like the full deal so uh right now i'm running black dog and that's basically what's in this bin right here is all black dog and then the agent orange and then i've got uh some of the um uh gorilla mints that i've got going so we've got a lot a lot to do so i'll show you this run i'll show you what the amount will be for the second run and like i said i'll show you the uh full amount of uh finished hash that comes out of the project so yeah again everybody smash that like button you know what to do right now if you're a new subscriber this is just a little in turn video on what i do between the seasons and uh oh yeah i'll show you guys these because this is some big ship popping uh this is officially 24 hours in the water oh yeah uh max stomper we've got 30 seeds in here and generally the ones that go down to the bottom are the ones that will pop first and i think i even got one popped already in there uh but this is mac stomper crossed with something else somebody this was somebody's project that was gifted to to me through a friend and uh this is gonna be my next um clone project so we're gonna pop all 30 weed out the males and these will also be going outdoor for my first uh for the first outdoor grow and those will be light depth so yeah thanks for hanging out in my kitchen tonight everybody all right guys take it easy peace", "30ufFiDcALU": "[Music] one thing you know I talked about besides you catching up with a few other growers this morning the law were talking about winterization and fresh frozen so how much I mean you don't have to tell us exactly how many pounds you're pushing yeah but even just a percentage if that's something you're getting into and and how much of it are you allocating to essentially for lack of better term diversify your portfolio totally so I mean we have 50,000 square feet of outdoor I would say this is the kind of the first year that I'm actually allocating a good amount of a to fresh frozen just kind of seeing where the markets evolved on the scale of production where we're at limitations on where we can dry it so getting into that fresh frozen which means we just take the plant fresh bucket down clean it up a little bit and freeze it right away straight to the fre straight to the freezer and that's where the extract artists these days are that's where they get the most high-end product that's Tyson to live rosin rosin indoor live resins you have the live rosin which is the organic kind of bubble hash extraction and then pressing it and I'll get you the live rosin and then the other side of it is the live resin which guys are pushing the fresh frozen material through BHO gotcha and then and then just creates a different product yeah well together right totally different cuz I actually this year just as an experiment gave the same crop same thing you know same everything same greenhouse to a BHO live resin just manufacture and a live rosin and the product is so different if I didn't know they were grown even the same strain really it's just such a difference in the way it comes out and we might even see that amongst extractors as well because the different techniques so that's kind of fun and cool it's just to see the differences of like your raw material because when you drive the flower it's gonna be the dried flower the extract brings this whole other element to come to our party so I think a Frenchie cannoli I know he's really come up on the scene lately and there's there's individuals like him around the world but it really is an art that's one thing you know as crazy as Frenchie can be I love that he really puts that emphasis that it is in art when he's doing bubble hash yeah you know and it is a totally different experience for them and that's the only thing it takes different infrastructure so you gotta have freezer rooms ways to transport that and then what if a freezer goes down and you know 200 pounds of material in there you gotta have a backup in place like so there's a lot of things it's a lot of lot to think about a lot of moving parts I probably prefer I wish I could just dry at all traditionally and and do that but it's fun to evolve with the market and see new products come out and be a part of all that so just got to adapt and do a little bit everything so overall I'd say probably you know we focused on trying to keep the tops of the plants for a flower the best stuff of the best and then focus on the lower and it also helps with the harvest time because we can get all those tops that are more susceptible to mold or botrytis get them hanging and dry in gives us some more time to deal with like the lower but still good quality yeah you know as a grower I always smoke the smalls I don't the biggest artichokes aren't always the most flavorful it's funny how that transcends so many things or even like yeah lobsters shrimp and there are so many things it's your point quality over quantity right so it allows us to to time out she says big hands you know you're the one I'm like is that from a song yeah so it allows us to time out the harvest a little bit yeah and so I'd say we're doing about 25% fresh frozen this year pretty fair amount for a 50,000 square foot canopy yeah that's that's why I got 420 square feet of freezer space this week there are there are supposedly some companies coming up that are that are manufacturing companies that rely on that fresh frozen material I haven't personally run into a company that's sending troops up to do that work for us I am working with one of the the biggest brands and in the space right now in the industry and they're about to launch if they haven't launched it yet a live rosin brand and I can guess who that is I think they're based out of justjust not too far from here actually based in here in Humboldt yeah and so we're gonna be one of their their main three producers for their fresh frozen line nice I mean I think it's probably open now is they have an Instagram up so I think that's all good but pop in Barkley's is introducing a live one brand brand so it's gonna be Papas Papas select [Music]", "94iivc9-ByI": "[Music] [Applause] hey howard is everybody doing out there hope you're all staying safe and healthy out there listen we got a new video coming up here for you it's kind of a a repeat of something we had before but um i thought maybe some of you guys uh wanted to see this again and uh we're gonna show it again so um we're gonna make some tumble some i'm gonna tumble some herb we're gonna make ourselves a nice nice little ball of hash kind of our old school way we're gonna tumble collect the kif and then we're gonna we're gonna bind it with some nice pho honey or something or or some isopropanol oil we're not quite sure yet but the first step of the whole thing is is tumbling out the uh the goodness out of this so uh we're going to use this this tumbler that i built in one other episode um showed you guys how to build one of these you know if you were handy with stuff and uh this is what we're gonna use so uh let's get it going um first thing i did was i i vacuumed out the chamber just in case there was any dust or dirt or pet hair or anything like that in there and uh this weed i'm using is just let's get the rest sticking to the side of the bag it's just some uh just all some um cut offs and trimmings from from the last one so uh yeah little bugs inside lots of nice little button there so what we're going to do is i'm going to load this thing up and we're going to uh we should make sure that we don't have this inside the machine because you don't want to drop any leaf in there so let's get it started all we got to do guys is open this chamber up i'm going to take this out of there and i'm gonna i'm gonna dump bag one in there just like that oh stevie's so allergic to this dust it's crazy man he just sets him off or a guy he can smoke it but he can't really handle this stuff okay so there goes number two all right throw in bag number three even and lots of little butt in there and a hell of a lot of leaf all right just like that let me get the lid close that up there shuffle it around i'm gonna okay the chamber looks pretty clean i'm gonna add this in there down it goes okay i'm gonna get the cord and plug it in just give me a second and i'll i'll get this all hooked up okay all right guys i got it rolling um i want you can see it's starting to fall out of there like crazy already i want to close it up because it's currently flying out too look at that really starting to come out so uh we're gonna close this i'm gonna run this guys for 15 minutes that's it and then that should give me the blondest of the blonde uh crystals and not too much leaf and dirt in there so um i'll show you what it all looks like okay all right guys we're back and uh this has been exactly 10 minutes since we started let's pop it and see excuse me oh here i'll lift it out we'll see it actually smells pretty spicy oh wow looks pretty good eh oh i bet you that's a lot once you start scraping it let me see i'll check the screen okay let me grab a little scraper and let's see what it does this looks like nice material though that's what it does today wow yeah oh does that look like nice material nice and blondy beautiful make sure your stuff's nice and clean yeah you got to go through it yeah so listen um this was a 10 minute tumble that's all i'm gonna do with it um from this point here we're gonna save this and we're gonna make ourselves a batch of hbo honey oil and then we're going to blend it so we'll get back to you on this when we're ready to blend it okay right nice powder smells good so anyways you know when we ex did this tumble for the hash um we ended up with this much um i showed you last time there we're gonna we're gonna use this to make some of that old school hash where we where we end up binding this with some we're gonna bind it with some honey oil that i'm gonna make i had some other uh some other shake kicking around some trimmings to it i tumbled it for 10 minutes and i ended up with this so i got i got two here that are gonna work pretty good this was already getting packed in there but um this is what we're gonna use i'm gonna start with this stuff first and then if i need more i'll add some of this to it so uh come with me and i'll show you how i'm gonna start making the honey oil to combine with this kif to make some nice hash all right all right guys so i'm doing this outside because it's a lot safer do this outside whenever you do this but um i've been extracting with the green machine here um butane extraction here with some of the cuttings i had and trimmings so so far i have already done uh a couple tubes of this already and i got one more to go here that i'm gonna run through uh with the green machine here and uh get it going there see it's starting so i'm going to finish this extracting and then i'm going to cook this stuff off into some honey oil just evaporate it good till all the bubbles are gone and then we're going to bind it with that kif i got all right so stay with me for now all right guys um i've been evaporating this for a while on the heating pad here i got it cranked up to 160. um it's pretty chilly outside we got snow out here see so um i'm gonna get this till it goes down all the way and then i'm gonna put it on a hotter element to make it into honey oil before we blend it with the uh with the kiff okay yeah so we'll let this we'll let this keep going for a little while here yet all right guys so i brought this inside now because it's it's kind of doable like we got like lots of ventilation in my garage here but um as you can see it's getting down getting down it's almost down all the way here um i'm just going to keep showing you as i go along here as it evaporates so it's picking up speed a little bit because it was so cold outside i couldn't even get this to go to 160 but um it should come back up here and and melt all that down and then we'll put it on a little bit hotter heat to get rid of all the butane all right all right it's still going here that ugly waxy looking stuff all kind of melted back in now because it's warmer so uh it's bubbling away here it's got a little ways to go and then we're going to get ready to add some of this nice this nice kit here we got okay i guess i got a little too closer with the lens all right yeah hey guys so i've um i've switched it up now from this pad that i was using right here this little uh like digital one which is really safe to use at the beginning when there's lots of fumes and stuff and you don't want nothing to ignite on you this is the way to go but it only goes to 160 mine and it just doesn't seem to get it quite quite hot enough for what i want to make into honey oil so now i've switched it up to this old one element uh old style here because the fumes coming off here isn't gonna be nothing real serious i gotta watch because i got some air move in here there's at this point here there's there's still some in it and it is ignitable but it'd be easy to put put out so i feel pretty safe doing it like this um so see how when i agitate it there's lots of bubbles still coming see that so i i like i like a temperature more like about 180. it seems to get it going just a little bit extra i know heat you know kills a little bit of the of everything from it but um trying to do this demonstration for you guys making it quick um so once this once this keeps going and i'm almost free of bubbles and it's turning into some nice honey oil i'm gonna then add the kiff like i've been saying to you guys to make it into hash ball so stay with me okay hi there guys so so it's almost there now ready to mix with the hash i got it there's some micro bubbles in there but uh it's close another couple minutes and i'm gonna wait till it's really clear like this and then i'm gonna take it out and uh i'm gonna take some out and leave some in the bowl and then i'm gonna add the powder to the bowl and mix it in this bowl it's all sticky already so um give me a minute i'll find myself a container and we'll carry on with this all right all right guys we're back so i ended up taking that much out of it and i left that much in there now i'm going to take the kif that i have here i'm going to dump some in there i'm going to dump more in there turn it in there like i'm making soup i'm gonna put more in there more put the whole damn thing in there i'm gonna mix it this is nice honey oil now i'm mixing it with so this this is going to take a little while and i got extra powder here to make the texture just right because it looks like there's a lot more oil right now than there is a kiff here okay let me uh at this point you're right i like to use a spoon nice clean spoon here sort of press okay so let me keep turning this this lovely goo it's way way too uh oily right now so we're gonna add some of this other kit we have get all this stuff started to clean out pretty nicely looks like we're gonna probably need most of it oops i see i uh a hair in it there looks like we're gonna need almost all of it i bet any money so guys i'm gonna keep turning this stuff i'm gonna i'm gonna probably put it into a uh a ziploc bag and uh step on it crush on it and keep working this all in there together see that oops texture is looking pretty good eh it's like once it all oops once it all comes together starting to get there look at that so let me uh let me work this a little better okay and uh i'll show you uh a little further down the road all right guys it's looking pretty nice i'm gonna i'm gonna put it in a bag now and and start to really uh squish it really good okay okay so i got it all in a baggie here now all right so now i'm going to uh now i'm going to start working it squishing it all right so i turned it here for a few minutes in a bag i'm still work i'm still working it but you can see how it's starting to turn all black looking really nice feels like really nice like a i nailed the texture the combination between the powder and the and the oil oh yeah it's a real nice ball it's it's getting there i'm gonna i'm gonna keep working it and then i'm gonna show it to you guys once i pull it out of the plastic hey guys so uh finally finished that hash and uh just trying a nice little nice little reef rubber right here is it ever sweet tasting tasting so nice well after i had it in that baggie and i squished it in that baggie and i i put that baggy i had the baggie in my shoe and i i walked with it underneath my heel for about half an hour and ended up with this nice nice nugget of it here um so nice this is don't forget this is some good kiff now and this is blended with some honey oil it's a little sticky on the outside as you can hear okay but um overall it's going to dry out it was just blended i'll crack it open i'll let you have a look on the inside look at that isn't that some nice hash look at that you can just see the crystal in it look at that there beautiful blend but anyways uh yeah so this is how i like making my hash this is nice strong hash and i hope this has been helpful uh hey um wanted to let you know so this this was all made um with the cuttings and trimmings okay and i ended up with this much honey oil too which is really nice nice honey oil here see-through this is what i use that i used to put the kiff together to make this so thanks for watching stay in touch keep your green thumbs up and we'll catch you on the next one right on [Music] you", "bZP9G0GOiUs": "[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] flip [Music] [Laughter]", "Ipq-GoeaQkU": "has been planted you", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "PG88Ezyr8cc": "hey guys youtube's been real awesome about the community guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the correct height for optimal dabbing just want to say if you're still watching this video to like the video because you know it's a pretty long video and if you're still watching it that means you like me [ __ ] also subscribe for better wheat this rig i think is called decline recycler i think i'm not gonna lie i'm not too sure so if you know exactly what kind of rig this is to drop it down below i have not taken a dab from this particular rig in probably a hot year hot year why do i say things so weird it's been over a year since taking a dab off this rig my go-to rigs as of recently have been um bottle rigs for some reason i just really like the way they chug and um also probably because they are the newest you know pieces to my collection so i've been you know going ham on those bottle rigs but they do chug like a [ __ ] [Music] first dab of the day okay that first dab was [ __ ] so we're gonna do another dab here um [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] that was a little hot it [ __ ] still had a lot of flavor it wasn't too too hot it's just a little hot i am [ __ ] high right now holy [ __ ] hey guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it um please don't forget to like subscribe and of course what else [Music] i'm really stoned and like i can

well a little gelato blackberry kush here seed plant it's now topped this one here red dragon clone seed plant caught the clone that's right uh topped also so five gallon pots i don't know if i'm gonna run them both in here in the same tent or if i'm gonna put one in each or you know what i'm saying because i do have another tent on the way and i also got something else let me let me just show y'all just a little bit of something here bam all right oh y'all don't worry about all that good dabs and stuff but look there i've been doing all kinds of uh bubble bagging we got the bubble dude washing machine and of course we got all the bags so therefore we've been doing all of our own uh hash making and all that good stuff which been doing that stuff for a while uh also let me show you this all right i know y'all can't see but anyway got some five gallon bags five gallon bags oh yeah look at that look at that that's what we're going to get to that's right that right there is garlic sherbet by our famous leaf logic all right and we also have that's right that's right bunches of it 9.1 something else is what it was a little over 9 ounces but uh it's really nice really nice turn the light on man you could really really see it but you can see all the damn but uh anyway turned out all right i'll get y'all a better look at that later on bam yep there she is girls guys rosin tech big smash love it love it i love it love it plates are heating up fixing to just temperature we're fixing to get on it got some 160s and 25 micron bags over here so uh yeah anyway back at you here all right there we go now y'all can see the colors of them you know how the lights are they turn them yellow but they work good work great man work great i just watered that's why everything's a little droopy got the runoff tested it was 1380 coming out which is all right i got tested again so it'll be lower this one here doing good i think it was around i can't remember i have to look at the book 970 something out not bad uh they just got fed today so you know how it goes a little dehumidifier there yeah that's her man that's her doing good so we'll see what's up we're uh also thinking about maybe uh getting processing license maybe doing a little uh solventless extraction in the ice water extraction uh doing some pressing with some live raws and stuff our next uh buy is gonna be a freeze dryer so you know and of course that's three grand but anyway we'll get there we'll get there like i said the farm and everything out there man i'm gonna have to start a new channel also and show you all all that and check it out but anyway i ain't gonna talk y'all's head off too much i uh will most definitely get y'all some updates and better videos and like i said everything's topped takes a little time to grow so once this girl gets up enough we'll scrog her out and fill the old tent all the way up again all right we all have a blessed sunday and uh i'll get back to y'all y'all check out js budget grow up there jay's got it going on brad being him a budget grower he's got it going on also he's starting out and see if we can help him on the way and uh just let him do it you know that's how you learn you eff up a bunch and everybody's like oh i told you so anyway it's all right bro we all do it good luck to you too hey i might see you today he's down here in oakley town from mizzou

just had to step up on the stool these are rocking in here her is number two up here in the front back city all the wedding crasher on the left also killing it decent enough formations here i went ahead and got the entire canopy netted up so you can see uh we'll start right here in the middle i guess all the way down keep things in check they're gonna start to flop over eventually same thing on this side i made it all the way down and now i can get these real close all right there same thing over here move this one away a little bit get it centered i got this uh light moved out of the way from the dehu it's a close fit but we're good for now things are popping off hard over here i've got plenty more room to go about two feet so it shouldn't be an issue if i need to raise the lights some more then i'll go ahead and raise them but everything is praying and the wedding crasher here on this side is starting off nice next round will definitely be more compact better node spacing but this one is definitely killing pushing uh just over 2ec 6.1 ph right now set to 76 and 60. and uh everything's all wacky right now because it needs to be calibrated and the sensor is sitting smack in front of the ac you can see the troll master sensor the black one and then i've got the atoms 14 back there i've got the wireless data logging going with the prototype over the bridges and uh you can see there's a tarot 12 sensor on the medium there and there's a couple more deployed throughout the field one over there and one in the way back and then three on this side throughout the table i've been monitoring the water content temperature and ec of each zone each light is its own zone so there's six zones starting here one two three four five and six so monitoring the climate the medium tracking how much they're eating how much they're drinking and just trying to get things dialed in and it's really hard to find you know something that looks unhappy just looking up here at this topmost plant this is hers number two and you can see the frost on this already on day 16. and there's absolutely no purpling anywhere it looks great let's bounce around to a couple different leaves here [Music] so everything is smashing just full on smash all right i'll catch you guys later peace", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios

so they're just weed oh there's oh there's a lot of [ __ ] I think it's like now I can't wait to cool [Music]", "34fes8T11f8": "hey there welcome back to danceBlue bodega the number one spot for Chicagoland cannabis patients in cannabis lovers all over the world over the age of 21 today is going to be our first episode of a new series called how to Canada and on this episode we're going to be covering one of my most favorite in one of the most confusing products hash [Music] hash is gotta be one of my favorite extract products because it's not only felt cerebral e it is also felt in the body and if you're medicating with cannabis to help kill pain then you really owe it to yourself to try hash if you haven't the making hash is very simple too if you have a grinder that separates Keith that's a big plus if not well you get one but anyway you take that Keith that you collect it you know put it in a pile and press they screw it down until it's nice and tight and you get a little puck now that would be hash that little punk another way to get hash is to take that Keith and instead of putting it in a pile impress you fold it in between a couple pieces of parchment paper and just roll a really warm bottle you know fill it with hot water actually want running hot water along the outside first and then fill it with hot water and just roll you know that bottle you know closed obviously over that parchment paper that holds your Keith and you'll notice that it's starting to get a little gooey like rosin that's when you want to just kind of start to roll it into a ball okay when you start rolling it into a ball if you use the wax or the parchment paper you'll see that it gets shiny so that okay so if you don't want it to shine up you're gonna end up with something like this which is cool if you you know cut it apart or whatever tear it apart you'll see the cross-section that it's not just rosin on the outside but lots and lots of Hesh on the inside so now that we have a general idea of how hash is made and what it is let's go over a couple of different ways to enjoy it okay you can put it on top or in a bowl or in a bong as long as you have a screen or like a Daisy Daisy screen to make sure that it doesn't pull through because you'll be upset if you can't go out and just buy straight Keith it takes a while to build up enough to make it significant or even worth your while so and also another thing I usually don't do that because it's really good at getting your pieces dirty so besides that there are a few different ways to experience hash the first way is to put it on top of flour something that call the power top the power top is actually pretty simple just you know take some ash put on top of your flower and there you go here you'll see bubble hash and I actually hit the lighter with the forks but do not do that I usually use a hand quick but as you can see here filming and trying to smoke a bowl with a heavy weight you know just it just didn't work if you look closely you'll see exactly why you don't want to put too much edge on top of your flower it falls and bongs and pipes aren't just being that's fine because I got one way to enjoy it for you rollers out there now while I wouldn't it recommend just rolling a joint or a blunt with straight hash okay that the it's trust me this would be terrible airflow it's it's gonna get wasted and you'll be angry with yourself but there is a way to enjoy and that way is called the Tynemouth okay well the time bomb is pretty much just a joint with hash but it's important how you put it together so you're gonna start off with just regular flour pack it up and then add your hash after that you're gonna see I have big chunks here you should crush them up smaller then just cover that up with a little bit of flour fill out the rest of the joint with flour add your paper and you are ready to go now whether online or you know at the dispensary or even in this video just now you might have noticed that not all hash looks the same and that's because not all hash is the same there's generally two classes of hash dal you got your full melt which is the tippy-top premium it's just the heads of the trichrome glands very little to no contamination and usually best enjoyed off of a dead male something I did not realize until after I made that video so while you can use bubble hash on top of your flour I would and I would just go ahead with our next time here which is the half melt now the half mount is pretty much everything else like the dry sift that's what they put in the pilot press screw down turn into a puck and there you go you have your hash coin another couple places where you'll see differences in full and half melt ash is potency full melt is usually around 70 70 to 80 percent of on the THC a whereas you know a half melt ash you know it ranges from anywhere from thirty to about 50 I haven't seen too many half melts that have gone over 50% but still excellent ways to you know enjoy or spice up some flour okay last but not least price there is a bit of a price difference usually about a 50% price difference between full melt and half melting full melts I've usually seen in the general area of around 50 to 70 dollars whereas the half melts you know if you could find a good hash coin or just you know some regular hash for around 2530 dollars that's a bets appeal you know so again another really good way to spice up flour well that just about does it for this episode I would like to thank all my friends family subscribers and supporters out there and of course as always thanks for the visit [Music]", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video

nice we're gonna put in this two by three rosin bag from cheer pressure and we're going to do a squish now this hash was made from flour it wasn't nothing crazy go to him also just scraggly buds so I expected to be decent at least from what I can tell it's got a decent color still a little on the darker side but it's got some gold to it [Applause] there there we have it it is gold a little bit of a darker gold but there we have it guys from hash to resin piece", "t8SETC7J6fI": "here we go we're working with some bubble hash that we made here at Coral Cove beautiful bubble house right here just put it in the freezer to get it more of workable so we can put it through here grate it so it breaks it down smaller to help bring bring out the moisture moisture is a killer you get moisture trapped in there and you don't properly cure it you're gonna get you some oldie ash you do not want that gorgeous mm-hmm persecute some stuff we made the other day it's almost nice and cured and dried or taking some of this and we're gonna repress it see what kind of turn and the quality that we get from it here's some more that we made sitting there getting nice and cured here in the frigerator right back to here we're breaking it up a little pieces kind of getting ready to grade to the grater there so we can have it broken up so it dries that are cures that maybe the way to mood because here's some of the rosin that we just made this morning from the hash bubble hash that we've made the other day here so some nice rosin a nice color beautiful hey it's uncle stoner check out more of the videos to come he's out", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database

elevators", "RlqozdPj3Xc": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick taste test dab review featuring washington state's knott's cannabis we'll be reviewing their lemon og this is some hash rosin i'm pretty excited to check it out i haven't had washington product in quite some time and so to be able to get my hands on some of this i'm pumped check out the packaging here we go and this is actually a brand new product hitting the market in washington we've got it hitting forbidden cannabis retailers throughout washington state and i've got some test results here to share with you guys let me go ahead and show you a little bit of the the rosin that we have here and then i know we got to stir it up so i did a little bit of warming action before we before we got going in here and so let me go ahead and get a nice whip going oh wow the smell on this is insane we're coming in hot at 2.4 total terpenes let me go ahead and scoop as much as this as i can on to the nice beautiful here we go lemon og some really really nice hashtags and check that out there we go and thc 65.88 total cannabinoids seven point i'm sorry 77.72 so in terms of uh in terms of rosin is it the most potent on the market no but lemon og is known to be more of a mild og you get these light citrusy notes this herbal flavor and of course the classic pine that og kush brings to the table so for this one here on the scent you definitely get that sweet pine and you get citrus notes as well there's even this sweet and sour and so i'm excited i'm excited we're going to do the one today i'm going to do two dabs so let me get a nice chunk of it here and then i'm gonna do dabs two ways we're gonna do a low temp dab how i normally dab a cold start and then we're gonna uh we're gonna clean that up and then i'm gonna do an opposite you know regular size or a regular dab where we heat it up first and then we count it down so here we go taste test review not cannabis i hope you guys are ready man wasn't just what a time to be alive man canada is from multiple states this is an exciting this is an exciting time here we go so again i'm a cold starter here we go all right there we go there we go oh wow that flavor is incredible sweet piney herbal you even get a little spicy the terps on this are actually surprisingly pronounced meaning they're right on the front as soon as you inhale it you get terpenes when you blow it out you get a different flavor profile it goes from inhale sweet and piney exhale this sour not necessarily gassy almost easily wow absolutely delicious in terms of a taste i've got to give this taste test this is somewhere close to that 9 9.25 range you know it's not like all strains or all you know flour cultivars that are out there or whatever you know they don't all have to be tens i think for what lemon og is the potential for that strain is roughly somewhere between a nine and a 9.5 on that taste test that scale out of 10. can it really be a 10 i don't know but for me i think this dab this this this particular version of this hash rosin absolutely delicious and so i really would recommend you guys try that out now we're going to do a regular dab where we heat it up and then we count it down and then we load the dab in on this other method this will give us a score out of 100 we base it on 10 categories we're based on 10 categories it includes presentation appeal it includes all kinds of things so we're going to get this just nice and heated up and clean burn it off real quick see if there's any residual oil looks like there was just a little bit just give it one moment here and see this is the reality for so many smokers like i'm although i do dab daily and i certainly enjoy rosin just as much as the canosaures i just don't invest heavily into super nice glass i know that it definitely affects the impact and impacts the flavor but the reality is is this is going to cool off and hit it and i personally will not notice a big difference between it and excuse me for being as ignorant as that may sound but i love dabs and i love dabbing the way i dab so here we go this is gonna cool off i'm gonna go ahead and revisit the the view on this look at this right here this beautiful hash rosin all right i know i'm definitely not gonna dab all that so i'm gonna stick to a nice healthy size right here we're gonna wait a little bit longer i don't want to burn it too much all right all right here we go good time for you guys to like follow and subscribe below check out knott's cannabis on instagram check out respect my region here on youtube be sure to subscribe go follow us on instagram we're just about ready i wanted you guys to get a fair perspective two dabs we're gonna

gee you get this slight citrus the high that i'm having come over me includes both a stoney effect i'm getting a body high and i'm also getting this sedation it makes me feel lethargic and i'm definitely no longer sober so big shout out to nan's cannabis taking the edge off after a long day my final score on this man wow 95 out of 100 this is my final score for the knots cannabis this is

be uploading and editing the video today and may be uploading it need to get a video from Bobby still yeah so I thought I'd just do this little video this is some of the 73 grated cheese from HQ from Barcelona this is the best-looking hash they had to be honest and it's still not even like I think maybe three star force star may be taught it yeah they need to start getting a bit better I think but I that were just going to do a little rosen video of all this I'm not sure I feel two ways but I should do that okay point 28 we pretty much just pick this up for like the last minute for all the money I've left in my account at HQ because I didn't think I had at me and then yeah I was just uh [ __ ] it might as well just pick up a gram of some bubble co DS and to be honest much better bubble here or what I've had recently so its fold this up so now I gotta follow up into a little light packet here I'm gonna go press it I'll be back in a second so I'm pretty much as compressed at 140 Rosen okay so pressed it two times is still like a little bit of residue up there so I might be able to fold it one more time for the left and there we go I'll show you this so those the first press still looks like you maybe get a bit more off of that I'm not and then here's the second press so we're just going to click this real quick and then yeah well it looks all right something best could have

bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it

know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear

in with you guys a little bit alright we out peace", "SwWQeTwtC00": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yang", "PD38e6gk1SA": "man ain't nothing wrong with

so let's get started you will need a wooden mixing spoon or electric mixer to stir the product today we are going to use a combination of a power drill with a mixing blade and a wooden spoon a thin flat plastic blade to remove the finished product from the bags we will be using a four-inch plastic putty knife your plant matter we will be using lavender buds today to make lavender essence a multi-purpose bucket or trash can the same size as your herbal extraction bags we will be using a five-gallon multi-purpose bucket a large bag of ice and your herbal extraction bags today we have our virtual Sun five gallon five bag herbal extraction bag kit step one stack your bags always put the smallest micron bag in first this will usually be the 25 micron bag each of the additional bags will be stacked on top of each other from smallest micron the largest our five bags set today stacks 2573 120 160 to 20 micron the 220 micron strainer bag will end up on top every time all the bags can be used at once or each bag can be used separately step 2 add ice fill the bucket one third full of ice step three add the plant matter start adding the plant material today we are using lavender buds to produce lavender essence spread the materials slowly over the ice continue until the bucket is about half full step four add water add cold water until the bucket is about three-quarters full make sure to use cold water room temperature or warm water will not work properly step 5 mix mix everything together consistently until it turns frothy like foamy green tea after you mix all of your ingredients let it sit for about 10 minutes for proper extraction step 6 strain stir repeat pull the largest micron bag out and slowly strain the liquid into the second bag dispose of the remaining product in the bag or set it aside to reprocess later plant matter can be reprocessed two to three times for maximum yield pull each of the remaining bags and slowly strain the liquid through the bottom into the next bag step 7 finished product all of the bags except the 220 micron strainer bag will have usable product in the motor remove from the bucket the finished product we have is lavender essence once it's been dried it can be used for potpourri candles perfume cooking or cleaning there are many uses for herbal extracts and powders thanks for watching we hope this video has

night weed reviews this is always the highlight of my week truly the highlight let me tell you what nothing more exciting than going to the dispensary and picking up a couple of new strains to smoke and to tell all you about it tonight i ended up picking up three different strains cashed in some of my points picked up this eighth right here for five bucks can't beat that so first up tonight we're looking at this trop santos it's a hybrid coming in at just a little bit over 28 thc look at those nugs man lately i've been picking up some strains that are real purplish looking in color but this no doubt is let's get that oh look at that absolutely dark purple let's take a closer look at these buds shall we let's bust one of these open let's get a bigger bed here we go oh look at that yikes see if the camera can focus in on that look at all of those dark purple hairs and all those crystals damn heck yeah smells smells pretty good not too strong of an odor but kind of got that purpley kind of earthy smell but most importantly what does it taste like right well as always i've got that packed here in my bowl and i've been talking on that for a little bit let's take another toke here let's spin that bottle around i would say that the smell definitely matches the date a little bit earthy got that distinct purple hard to explain kind of taste to it but all in all definitely good i would definitely rate this a thumbs up of course all the strains i've been picking up lately have all been getting thumbs up but i've got two more to review tonight will tonight be the night that one of them gets a thumbs down i don't know you'll have to stay tuned and find out but as always please show your support make sure you're subscribed to my channel like and leave your comments down below and until my next video i'll see you then hmm", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "bYdCOS_d3xk": "welcome back to the talking head I'm Josh McCain and this is your cannabis business podcast today we're gonna make hash Frenchie cannoli style famous hash maker that you're going to need a couple of things products for one we've got some trim you'll need a scraper you need some kind of matte weather silicone or otherwise you need some ice and then access to a hose or water bucket different micron bags they come in all different shapes and sizes I'm going to use a few of these friend she uses four different bags he starts with one ninety then one sixty forty five to twenty five if you don't have those exact numbers don't worry about it I don't either I'm starting at 220 followed by one sixty seventy three and then twenty five you should yield about ten percent on average but we ran our last batch came up with not so great you know pucks here a bad product and bad product out has probably already been Keith we're gonna try new bags same ice same cold ice same method and see what kind of result we've got I've got a nice bubble machine is gonna be helpful as well you're gonna want to towel some alcohol to soak the microns because after the first and maybe third wash it's gonna clog up you'll no longer have that sift function so we're gonna fill this up a third of the way with ice a third with our material and then again a third I'm gonna have a trim sandwich [Music] five or six times the first one we're gonna do for about want to make sure to start everything clean make sure to clean as you go so after this first round we're gonna clean that micron bag I'll show you that in a second after we drain this simply just take those run it through nice and green we run that through all of our four bags you can separate each bag with a different bucket if you want I'm just going to run all the bags consecutively and put some water in it fill it up and then run it for two minutes so we're gonna use our tool bitch bag after getting most of the hash we're gonna end up cleaning it with some alcohol so could scrub it get it really clean so after we clean the smallest micron bag in this case it's a 25 micron bag we cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol at 99% whatever you've got to clean it real good put it back in there and network going to flush the second time after it ran for two minutes I feeling it a third time we're gonna run for six minutes now [Music] you may find that the filter and the machine clogged so by turning it on and off that will spin it hopefully unclog it allowed to drain more so after the second rinse we're going to check the filters of the bubble bags the trick to that is kind of just pretend like the panning for gold we wanted to shake it make sure that there's enough air so for example with there's holes at the bottom of this bucket and if you don't lift it up and give it air it's harder for that said water to drain through as you sift to get the water to drain out a lot faster otherwise you're gonna be there for days hoping it just drains out [Music] top bag is retinues you just toss that out throwed the backyard yard waste is illegal interstate open this up like a piping it's freakin south you can also grab a cold frisbee throw it in the back here this makes for a nice little pleasement just read this out a lot [Music] this is a 25 micron bag so after about 3/4 of the way through we have about two and a half percent yield normally you're looking at at least 10% because we're using unusable trim we don't expect so after it's dry 4.2 ounces here so it's all mixed in from the different micron bags you can see the different colors but just like data shit in shit out so we're finally done what the hash was very long process took a while we did about two or three different bags per day obviously over a few different days we'll leave a link to the show notes of how friends she does it takes him about an hour per cycle I did it a little bit faster because the product I was using wasn't as good obviously Frenchie and only professional and does a phenomenal job starts with the best product I didn't have that luxury but for us we're done so with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the talking heads don't forget to Like share and subscribe or don't an amount [Music]", "4Jwgy80QvrE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Hc9Thrm8RJU": "[Music] hey everybody this is Josh mohab coming at you from Denver Colorado wanted to discuss another frequently asked question that we get quite a bit and that's gonna be our choise method a yes that is a made-up word we made it up we had to call it something so we wanted to call it a schwa z because it deals with scissors and cutting all the leafs off and it sounded cool those are the reasons I got for ya and so some of the things that we do though when it comes to choise is uh pretty unique we will take the the flower plant or the plant when it goes into flowering and will strip all the fan leaves off of it by doing it we call them cactus girls cuz they're no longer nice big bushy plants but don't don't get too concerned because give it a few days it's gonna bounce back incredibly quick some of the things that we do when it comes to our choise we relate it to going to the gym if you beat yourself up at the gym a lot of times it's going to make you stronger in the long run so we do the same thing to our plants however what you feed yourself after the gym is very important just like what you feed your plants after choir's is going to be very key for them to be able to bounce back biggest reason is your taking away all those families most families have nicknames whether it's sugar factory or whether you know it's all the micronutrients that they have in there those actually make their way into the flower as all you growers know and so it's very important to if you're going to remove them from the family to replace the micronutrients that they're going to be receiving from them in the feed line that's where success nutrients comes into play we built it solely based off of off of our methods and how to grow cannabis we wanted to make sure that we had a nutrient line that was unique and different and not like all the other ones out there everybody focuses big-time on all the macronutrients which are gonna be your nitrogen phosphorus and potassium these are the nutrients that are good when you're growing big ad crops and big commercial crops when you're growing cannabis it's very important to focus more on your potage your Boron's and etc without getting to botanist on you all your micronutrients and those are the things that we replace in the feed line for success nutrients we do have an entire staff of people that are willing to help you along the way if you do have some questions or some curveballs come up in your grow where a phone call away we encourage you to utilize that like I had mentioned before we mix about 5,000 gallons a day of water at our facilities so we are around a ton of plants all the time and pretty much any given time you're gonna have a little over six thousand seven thousand plants on on-site as well that's no exaggeration when we harvest about a half metric ton a month so we're happy to help with all these things this is something that we're very seasoned with something we've worked on for a credibly long time and so utilize our team if you can avoid that learning curve it can get pretty expensive when you do things wrong especially with growing cannabis nothing's cheap about it anyways another thing when it comes to schwozzam is going to be the whys behind it are gonna be one to provide optimum light penetration and two to refocus the plants energy so when you strip the plant the way that we do it's actually going to allow pretty much no shade spots in the entire plant and so when you can do that it's also going to refocus the plants energy to all the tips and that's where all the new flowers will be sprouting from which is why if you've sua's before you've seen them bounce back incredibly quick within you know sometimes as early is four to seven days they're already looking like you didn't even schwozzam which is wonderful which means you got a great feed line that you're bouncing back with as well if for some reason your choise and you're not running a success nutrient feed regimen caution I don't really know what to tell you be careful make sure that you you know you can contact us and get some nutrients for your own side-by-side so you can see them bounce back the way that they should a lot of people think that defoliation is not the way to go well those people just haven't tried success nutrients yet so they need to give it a shot and and be on our page because what we're doing is very unique disruptive and different and those are the things that we're trying to do constantly being dissatisfied with being satisfied is how you'll find a lot of the boys on the like team we call it three alight because it's easy to stand by we're far north of four pounds of light with a lot of our genetics and we encourage and we want to get you guys to farm up to four pounds of light as well and with that be sure to give us a like on Facebook give us a follow on Instagram we got we're getting some followers up there we could definitely use a few more so give us a follow and subscribe to our youtube channel because we're gonna be dropping these videos more and more frequently and trying to just get some more knowledge out there for free for people and yeah if you do have the book you do have the nutrients utilize the staff and the team you know we're very passionate about what we're doing here and that will hopefully come through when you're talking to people if you do have any questions if you guys run into any issues in your garden definitely reach out to us in our team because we want to help even if it has nothing to do with success nutrients or the choise give us a call if you guys run into some issues like some thrips or some maybe some mites haven't forbidden luck definitely give us a call cuz we've dealt with them before and we're happy to help in the meantime though have yourself a wonderful day and I'll talk to
