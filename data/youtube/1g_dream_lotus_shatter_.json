hey guys", "vesCap1dIGc": "[Music] what's up everybody - boy max beads here IMAX reviews and just real quick before we get started I just want to say that when I was doing this video is actually recording like a different video on some true clear with the with a DAB mod but then I got word that the the true shatter of Manor and dream was out so I just like stopped the video went out got it and then started doing the video on this so the intro of after this intro is gonna be I'm gonna say true clear and I'm really gonna be doing true shatter Arthur buddies so what's up at your boy max beats here at max reviews once again and we got some very exciting stuff happening right now let me just get you guys informed we're going to be trying new ways of you know doing trying the true clear and just trying to get a better idea of what things are like outside of the realm of what I got which was the babe cards and stuff like that so if you want to fill your own cartridges and the easiest way to do that you can go ahead and check the video and there that I made about that there's also a link in the description of that video where you can get the syringe needle tip the blunt needle tip to fill it very very easily takes about 20 seconds tops to get your cartridge filled okay but that was last video so we're moving on moving on to a new product now and it's by canna stick guys so can a stick okay got a bunch of products here okay though but we're going to be trying about all this stuff shots the kind of thing for sending me these things guys like they're so boss to the staff there is like just so chill so laid-back so awesome and they will definitely get you out anything that you order from their website immediately it took like a day and a half for these to get here and I'm just super excited they're all basically for wax or for debt like if you look at here it's a dab mod it's a bubbler and then you got the canna stick dab mod here this is the bubbler for it and then you got the mini so it's a little bit more discreet and then you got the slim wax pen as well I think I'm gonna do a separate video on all these all this stuff right here cuz I didn't even open it so it really excited I can't win a dabber tool so I'm just gonna use that to go ahead and get this plastic off want to be careful now because this has glass products this is so nice guys I got the gunmetal color here it is and it is wow it's so nice guys Wow so that was a tough why you really just have to touch it so here's the touch so one two three four or five will turn it on no it's so nice so I actually um I tried to get a hold of something else and I couldn't get the person to respond I was gonna review something like that but I found something even better which I'm like totally glad that that person didn't even respond because it put me onto this and actually got a really good like thing going on with this company now so totally glad that happened but I did get a similar thing to what I did see and this is it it is a glass globe and I will do a video on that if you are looking for something on a budget because these things are not a - too expensive but they are a little bit more expensive than this this is like really really cheap so but it does work definitely can vouch for that so big big news as you guys already know that mandarin dream has arrived and true shatter on opened in the flesh or in the plastic or in the concentrate whatever but as you see in a second ago or actually I did like a first part of this video so I was showing you guys the you know the the bubbler but I didn't have the bubbler attachment on I just had the actual hand so I put on the dual coils okay and now let's try this shatter housing my first time trying to shatter guys oh man I'm so excited I don't know what it's gonna taste like I don't know what it's gonna be like I've never had shatter before my leg super excited about it and not only am i super excited about the fact that I'm gonna be trying to shatter but it's the fact that I'm gonna be trying Mandarin dream which is not even on the fly yet while I'm doing this video so maybe by the time it gets out it might be on there but I went to Li fly and it's not even on there so it hasn't even hit the streets yet people I mean it has guys now um so it has 64 point five percent THC so that's a little alarming to me because I really thought that the true shadow was gonna have a lot of THC Center of you where someone said it had like 97% THC or something like that so I was hoping for something high like that but a sixty four point five percent THC 0.2 CBD know this THC be no CBN and at one point a CBG and yeah it comes out to six hundred and forty five milligrams so I don't know I guess I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna wait it don't we guys have seen it let's take it out and see what we got and he see we got what's it gonna be oh so that's it just that I don't know what's gonna happen I'm like a piece of who is very clear look at that Wow look at that guy's beautiful crikey look at the size of it and look at the coloration oh yeah I'll even get closer for you guys for all those who want to get frisky oh yeah now you're really they really get into that shatter huh huh all right well enough goofing off let's uh continue on with the review I guess I'm just supposed to take like a little piece like this okay so I'm just gonna take this little piece and I will get over on back to you guys all right baby I'm sorry so I just dropped my dad my first dad dropped it geez such an uber okay so I will take my dad I will then place it upon the coils of this like so see that in there cool cool beans all right so I'm gonna put my cap back on I'm gonna put it on a medium setting let's hope for the best guys Cheers salut and wish me the best luck because I don't know what this is gonna be like [Music] oh my god it is so good oh my god this is the best tasting this is the best just tastes so good guys oh my gosh I don't wanna let it out it tastes so good oh my gosh and I feel the effects coming on immediately wow wow yeah I like this stuff I kind of ghosted that so it's not gonna be too much smoke for you guys I'm so surprised on how good the tea's it with very smooth - okay now I can taste it starting to decrease a little bit but wow that is really good to taste is amazing guys Wow - times up I would give you know what screw it it is what it is so I'm gonna go ahead and confidently give this the max beats official four thumbs up like four thumbs up guys like this stuff is it's the bee's knees um I'm feeling good I don't even see this just stuff on I don't even see this stuff on the fly but when you do go to the truly website which I'll show you here right now if you look at the concentrate section then you go to all the way down to the indica true shatter so nut in the kachou shower then you see the you see the Mandarin dream okay it says it's out of stock in my it's out of stock everywhere right now anyway I'm sorry so when you click on it okay you guys notice then it does not even have and it doesn't bring you to leaf LA when you click on it usually when you click on something from true leaf it brings you straight to the fly but not the case when you click on Mandarin it goes to that so it's saying that it's an indica dominant hybrid whoa it's thought about guys I mean they're selling it as a indica anyway this strain is to fire I'm getting a I'm getting an indica dominant hybrid kind of hide to it I'm gonna say I mean it's just really a good it tastes so good I almost want to just try to get it for the taste oh yeah oh wow I thought is gonna be done just a lot more in there guys god this pen is amazing shut off the candlestick and shout out that truly the holy cow this thing is going ham wow I am so medicated guys I'm like wow I feel good feels really good and it was such a small portion that I took off of there such a small portion oh dear guys look at this oh my god it's so look at this you can see through it and truly is clear which is why they call it true clear like I mean you know what I'm saying guys it's not true is it your question to shot or whatever come on they didn't know what they were done when they made the name true clear it truly is clear guys that's their thinking what should we name it I don't know but it truly is clear so they like true clear it is yeah guys look at that oh man oh man finesse finesse that is so beautiful guys oh alright that's it so I'm gonna give you guys so I'm feeling so good right now I'm not gonna lie to you it was probably the best out of any out of marijuana like flower oil anything cannabis in general if it has to see in it and yeah that's in it Siena accounts it's the best tasting THC that I've ever tasted in my life and I've tasted a lot of good THC and it's got to be the top 300 percent so let's see if we can get anything in here going smoke I could still taste it it tastes like cannabis this reminds me of about my phone's ringing well I actually really have to pick up his phone call it's actually really important phone call so give me one second all right so sorry about that back again glad I picked up the phone well because it was actually very important I did not weigh this and that was a whole flippin point of me doing it before so I took a little bit out this weighs over a gram guys who a he's 1.1 11.11 and and I took some off of this I know this scale is on point because I just weighed a dollar and a nickel as well so it's definitely on point the bubbler that went well you guys already seen them you might have already seen the bubbler attachment depends on how I head at this video but I wanted to try the bubbler attachment on the dual coils so I'm gonna do that and the coolest thing about the bubbler attachment is you can just click this take off your cap and then you can let's dive in there here's what it looks like I'm just gonna good let's put that right in there I'm good you guys see that but Wow I tell you that taste it was a really strong dad too Wow it tastes very pungent and earthy man that one really hit me hard ooh tastes really earthy pungent woody oh man it's so good the taste is so good I don't know what that tastes like so I told you guys that I gave I gave you the four thumbs up and it really is the four thumbs up I'm like I'm smacked guys Wow I don't think I want to take anymore I don't care how good it is if I take anymore I'm gonna be like too much medicated so I'm pretty much done for today but I just want to say wait Wow truly um for 64 percent THC it's like what a heavy hitter um I love this stuff up I can't like it's so insane because true shatter is never around so it seems so this is my first time getting true shatter cut it got it a few other times but I wanted to like wait for something special so that's it guys I can't like I said for thumbs up I can't complain it's a you know a big thing I'm a true leaver that's all I got for you guys leave in the comments what you guys think I really would recommend that you check out the canon can a stick I really really do these guys really know what they're

like 14 karat gold-plated coils so you're really smoking with gold with this thing like you know I mean that's it that's all I got for you I'm gonna let you guys go thanks for joining in peace you", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

just spent gym let's talk more clouds on stop asking where the Louds from we get it from the ends same place where our sounds from we don't dwell though always wanted a place on Melrose but I don't know whether I will or won't go analytic II ever the pessimist came for the bag give up the rest of it when it's sudden only for testing it cuz only deficit definite and only [ __ ] be stressing it and only [ __ ] [ __ ] test when they guess in it welcome to today's video today we're gonna be looking at some concentrate sent over by hemp elf in the goods lines which you'll see here we've got some skittles CBD wax we've also got some pineapple Express CBD waxed we've also got some Blue Dream CBD shatter which is CBD isolate coming in at 99% CBD these products are perfect for anyone looking to get really high CBD content the waxes come in at 80% CBD and then as you will see the CBD shatter comes in at 99% CBD so you're not really gonna get it any stronger than that and before we get in to smell in these products I'm gonna tell you guys hemp bastard actually send over a little chat which shows you guys which terpenes have been added to these products because these concentrates are chirping infused so if there's a specific chirping that you enjoy more than others you can see if latter being has been added to any of these concentrates and by that specific concentrate and tipping's are a huge part when it comes to cannabinoids it gives the flavor it gives the smell and also gives different effect so you can pick specifically which tipping you like most and by that product depending on which to beam you like most so there's a few ways we're gonna use these concentrates the first way being the dynamap with the Dyna coil this is pretty much the primary way I've been using these concentrates the Dyna coil works perfectly with these concentrates but also I'm gonna get myself a concentrate pad and try these concentrates in the mighty the hemp elf did actually send out some rolling papers to which is force and they've got the all-natural rolling papers the pure hemp papers and the ultra-thin papers so we are gonna roll a joint up with one of these papers and use some of the flour that they supplied and we're going to crumble some of these concentrates in to give us that extra added CBD boost to a joint and then we're gonna get this glass piece we're gonna fill the bowl up with some flour we're gonna put some of the concentrates on top and then again we're gonna go through some combustion with some flour and add some concentrates on top of that but again the big big CBD boost so let's get to what these concentrates smell like we're gonna start off with the blue dream which is the CBD isolate and this one's got a really nice fresh smell but I'm gonna go straight to the terpene breakdown that hemp elf did send over because it's pretty much bang on this one's got a very strong piney smell and quite a strong close smell to it it seems like the breakdown when it comes to what happens they've added to these absolutely bang-on because it seems like while they're saying they've added it's exactly what these concentrates smell like which is good this one does have kind of like a strong cleaning product smell to it but it's not bad really strong really fresh smell to this one so next up we're gonna look at the skittle strain which is the CBD wax and instantly and get a slight citrus smell to this one but this stuff has got quite a woody smell to in and I've always said with these waxes they've almost got like like a toffee or a caramel like sweet smell to him but this one in particular this is called quite a few smells come into it it's got a sharp citrus smell it's also got a sweet smell to it it's got quite a woody smell and there's probably a little bit of pine hiding in the background of this one as well but another super strong fresh smelling concentrate so we're gonna put a skittles down now I'm gonna pick up the pineapple Express where the skittles had more of a sweet smell to it this one has more of a like a sour citrus smell to it similar smelling but you can definitely tell the difference from the skittles and the pineapple Express and the one thing I've got to say about these concentrates is that they do actually smell how the tipping breakdown says they should smell if it says they've got a peppery smell they definitely got it if it says it's got a citrus smell you can definitely smell the citrus so use that chirping break down to pick specific smells and tastes through these concentrates because they're pretty bang on when it comes to the smell and quickly now that the smell test is done I want to show you guys what these are looking like up close so first of all we're gonna start with the pineapple Express and this is what the pineapple express looks like a closed super clean almost looks like orange peel and then we're gonna look at the blue dream up close and as you can see here the CBD isolate looking super clean really crystally as well and lastly we're gonna look at the skittles up close and lastly we've got the skittles looking just as beautiful as the pineapple Express these concentrates are clean so there's nothing else I can really do either then show you guys using the product now so we're gonna get a little bit of this blue dream the Dino coil is already in the dynamap I'm gonna get a little chunk and put it on top of the Dino coil and then we're gonna put the cap on and we're gonna heat this up and I'm going to show you guys the vapor production on these concentrates is amazing it is actually a lot different than flour the flavors a lot better the vapors a lot better my normally got a few seconds after the click super smooth it has some great flavor and the flavor profile I get off this is a really clean pine taste that's kind of really one of the only tastes I'm getting off this but it's really clean no throat irritation super vapor clouds and a nice strong pine taste let's go for hit number two whoo-whee blown out some clouds here and one thing that's different about concentrates from flower is just how long the concentrates go there's so much stronger than flower and you can just go hit after hit whoo I felt that one in my eyes in my nose in my brain and normally I'll get about to heat up with the dynabar we're going into the fourth heat up here I see how much papers left from this blue dream who still get in amazing vapor I'm not sure when this is gonna stop so one of the things I really like about these concentrates is the fact that they don't have any cannabis smell or cannabis taste some people might want that personally for me it's awesome to have a concentrate that you can use any time of the day no matter where you are because if you've got a concentrate pen or a Titan of app with a Dyna coil or the mighty with a concentrate pad you can take these around with you all day and no one will ever suspect anything because we're CBD flour sometimes you can have the worry of nosy neighbors worrying about the smell all being up in public and wanting together a little CBD hit but I want to light up a joint this stuff is perfect there's no smell to it so you can actually take this out in public a normal micro dose with some super strength CBD so we're going in for another heater we're gonna get any more vapor from this Bluegreen whoo-hoo Wow that is still next up what I'm gonna do is only get my mighty an attorney it's a 210 and then I'm also gonna get half of a dosing capsule without the lid and I'm gonna get a little concentrate pad and I'm gonna put that into the mighty and I'm gonna conceal that heat in there so once the concentrate hits that concentrate pad it's gonna completely melt straight away and we're also gonna put it through some water this time there we go we're at 210 which is the highest temperature for the mighty it's gonna take that cap off I've actually got a little chunk of this skittles so what I'm gonna do is put it straight on to the concentrate pad and that is gonna start melting that wax now as you'll see there so I'm gonna put the glass adapter back on leave it for a few seconds for that concentrate to melt into the concentrate tab and then I'm gonna get my glass and let's try some of this skills these concentrates in a vaporizer through water adjust summit gals super clean super cold hit and that skittles in this vape through water the sweetness is the first thing you taste so that's going for another hit whoo amazing I kind of caramel toffee taste is coming in a little bit now but the sweetness on this skittles it's amazing these concentrates amazing for anyone who smoked and are looking to get into vaping because I feel a lot of the time the one thing that people struggle with who smoke who want to get into vaping isn't a chest hit the throat hit by heavy vapor and I feel a lot of our of the time when you're vaping and less you have really good technique with very specific vaporizers it's quite hard together big cloud of vapor but with these concentrates you seem to get really big vapor clouds all of the time which may satisfy some of you smokers out there looking to kick smoke into the side and get into vaping let's see what these vapor clouds are like no this isn't smoking in fact this is probably one of the complete opposite things to smoke in this is probably one of the purest forms of vaping you're gonna get super clean super tasty flavors on this skittles are just amazing they don't seem to deplete at all I'm getting sweetness I'm getting that like caramel style taste I'm getting a little bit of a piney taste and as you will see the vapor just keeps on going whoo yeah I'm definitely getting a lungful of vapor with these concentrates super satisfying vapor production super satisfying flavor I see if we got any more in this mighty whoo I think this mighty could probably go all day so we're gonna put that to the side and now I'm gonna pick up a little bit of the flour that they sent over I'm gonna pick up this glass piece and I'm gonna hit some of these concentrates mix them with some flour and see what they like with some combustion they did send over a grinder so I'm gonna put it to use I'm gonna put some of this skittles CBD flour butter sent over into it and we're gonna grind it up and then we're gonna fill a bowl pack it with some concentrate and see if we can get a big CBD hit Oh skills flour it smells amazing super super sweet-smelling strain there you go we've got some skittles CBD flour and some skills concentrate so I see what this tastes like through some combustion that is some amazing flavor now I can already feel it go into my head the flavor on now was amazing that was probably one of the best hits through combustion I've had the flavor was unreal and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna grab some of these all-natural rolling papers we're gonna get some more of the skittles CBD flour we're gonna mix a load of these concentrates in and I'm gonna really try and make a really tasty joint also these papers super handy because they've got the paper and the Roach in the booklet so all you need is this that is actually really handy so for this thing packed up and I'm gonna hopefully try and show you guys what this joint looks like on the inside because there's wax there is shatter there is there's everything in this and I'm hoping you can see it let's roll it and smoke it so you've got a little power joint what we're gonna do is take this little hat off quick and there we go nice light and in this joint guys I crumbled up all three of these concentrates and I used some of hemp elfs skittles CBD flour mix they're all up put in a joint I see what I look like after this has been smoked while I smoke this joint - one thing I want to say about these concentrates on the cannabis side is that for me I feel as though they make my high so much cleaner there's no paranoia there's no anxiety there's no bad feelings every time I use these concentrates with THC whether I'm smoking or I'm vaping them I feel like I never get that really fast shoot up to being high and that really fast come down or now really slow come down I kind of just go in and out and the high always seems a lot more comfortable when he's concentrated involved I keep taking drags of this joint and I just keep randomly getting super citrusy and super piney hits which is really nice yeah yeah you can death from now drag just then I could taste the CBD wax whether it be the skittles or the pineapple Express I could definitely taste one of them them and could differentiate between the wax and the isolate which tells you something this the taste of these are super strong I'm getting some crazy flavors through this one second it's the wax the next minute it's the isolate the next minute it's the flower every drag is different I suppose now the sessions done what do I think about the looks at least concentrates and for me they're amazing from the wax to the ice a lot they just clean the wax is really nice and orangie golden with an ice crystal shine on it and this blue dream shot it's almost like rock salt is had its crystally is shiny and again super super clean and now let's talk about the smell guys and like I did say himself actually sent me over a little picture that tells you all about what to expect from each team that's been infused into these concentrates and again they're clean they're fresh they're strong and they've also got their subtle differences as well which means you can pull them apart and they all don't smell the same the wax is more of like a caramel toffee sweet smell to them whereas the isolates got more of like a strong cleaning product smell to it very piney smell to it as well the one thing I do like about all of these concentrates though is when you open that lid the smell hits your nostrils these concentrates are really nice and strong smelling now let's get to the taste I'm gonna say the taste is very similar to the smell when I was using the Blue Dream it had that piney taste very very similar to the smell that piney peppery taste when I went to the waxes they add that more toffee caramel like I've been saying that kind of taste to him with more of a citrus on the pineapple express side and more of a sweetness on the skittles side where there is a diner vapp with a diner coil the mighty with the concentrate tab the glass piece with the combustion or the joint all of them had really good flavor and the flavor came through no matter how I consumed these concentrates do I think these a day or a night time strain and like I said earlier they're amazing for actually using up in public because they normally have that cannabis smell to them so I would say these are great for the daytime or the nighttime pain relief throughout the day pain relief before bed these things are perfect no matter what time of day you use them and now let's get to the effects because I felt as though there was one category where these beats pretty much everything I've ever tried when it comes to CBD and that is pain relief these concentrates for me were just pure pain relief if I needed a big strong dose of CBD to get rid of some pain these were perfect weather I've a deal where I smoked it these concentrates absolutely melted my pain whether it was my muscles whether it was my joints whether it was a headache it didn't matter it seemed like every time I use these concentrates they just wiped my pain away and when it comes to the effects I feel as though these are a lot different to flower actually when you vape or smoke flower you get the heavy head burs you gather heavy eyes you sometimes get that couch lock feeling I feel as though the effects with the concentrates they were a lot more clean I didn't really gather head burrs or all those heavy eyes I feel as though I could use these and get on with my day which is why I said these are perfect for pain relief because you could use these at any time of the day and not worry about things like smell and such and and get our pain relief that you need these concentrates would be perfect for anyone that's looking for the benefits of CBD but not really looking for the heavy head bus heavy eyes couch lock feeling that CBD flower gives you and overall guys these have been super fun to use super easy to use when it came to the diner coil and concentrate pads in the mighty was a little bit of an extra when it came to adding it to the joint too because the flavors were just so much better and I feel as though these definitely serve a very specific purpose for me if I need pain relief if I need that extra super intense dose of CBD I'll use these will they come into play all the time no personally I'll always go back to flower but like I said these are perfect for anyone that doesn't want that couch locked feel doesn't want that CBD buzz that sometimes you do get from flower and you just want Percy BD relief pure CBD benefits these are perfect super clean super smelly super tasty these have been amazing to try out unless a guy's some super strength CBD right here 80% and 99% these are gonna push a flower so much favor if you want to use these with flower imagine super sticky weed that is what this is like when these concentrates melt on your flower they just push your flower so much further really nice on their own but also amazing to mix with flour this right here for me is just pain relief in a little jar these are like my paracetamol and my ibuprofen these are pain relief these are what I use for pain relief if I need that super strong dose of CBD these are what I go to if you guys enjoyed the video click the thumbs up

it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "qElGPJQuy3A": "hey guys just wanted to jump in before the video today and let you guys know that I'm moving channels hopefully this one's easier to spell remember find and all that kind of stuff I know a lot of you guys have had trouble trying to find these videos so I really appreciate you guys watching and supporting me so far I have a lot more coming and a lot more products to review a lot more devices coming subscribe to that new channel to stay up to date with my uploads and I'll get out of here so we can start the review hey guys today I'm gonna be comparing and reviewing the crumble vs. shatter both of these came from move in Tampa I just wanted to kind of show them in video and explain the differences between them the consistencies and try to show you guys how they both work get my thoughts on both of them as well both are high THC focused concentrates with different consistencies the blue as they call it or crumble is a more dry consistency and a little bit easier to work with it comes in a small glass container which is easy to travel with the shatter however is best stored in a cold area because it needs to keep it's hard glass like consistency it's not really easy to work with when it's freezing cold or in a hard state so I let it sit out for a little bit to get into a more taffy-like consistency it's a little easier to work with then and I roll it into small little like nuggets when I have it in those small nuggets it's just easier to dose with Florida's humid climate will make the consistency of the shatter change if it's just left out so it's best to keep that in the fridge the crumble is best kept out of direct sunlight I think that will make it turn soupy as well maybe it is the ease of use but I am using the blue a lot more it seems like I run through that a little bit quicker the shatter I've tried a hybrid and indica and a high CBD shatter all of them I really enjoy effects wise but just the consistency is frustrating rolling it into the little nuggets is great and that's what I prefer to do but this high-cbd shatter is impossible to work with it just sticks to the paper that it's then it's hard to get off of the dabber tool it's hard to dos with when you have it on a surface I just can't even recommend the high-cbd shatter as much as I enjoy the effects it's just so frustrating to work with the flavor on both is really interesting the crumble has a little bit more of a hashey kind of earthy flavor a little more similar to the flour the shatter has more of a flavor that's similar to like the taste of terpenes form cut cookies that's the hybrid that I was using it tastes a lot more kind of chocolaty on exhale kind of sweet on inhale as well if I had to say I would probably say I prefer the taste of the crumble as well it just tastes more similar to the flour when that's baked the smell is a lot more noticeable on the crumble as well pretty much as soon as you open this little bag you can kind of smell the residue of the crumble the shatter doesn't really have so much of a aroma to it at all really you only smell it on your exhale because it's so close to your nose it's not as loud or dank as flour but the crumble does still have a smell the Blue has a much smoother effect on set so if you're a patient that's looking for kind of immediate relief you might actually prefer the shatter for me I really like to let the effects onset over a longer duration so the crumble really worked well for me because I could use it during a 30-minute session and get to my desired dose and be done for a couple hours whereas the shatter I felt like I had to keep revisiting it to continually get to that dosage if you guys would like to see reviews of each of the shatters individually let me know and I can do it since I'm wearing blue we're gonna use some of the blue it's kind of interesting the crumble almost turns into like a peanut butter when you leave it out in the Sun like I've been sitting here shooting so hopefully it packs got it hopefully this shows up on camera see this thing is just getting so called it's all my testing I guess [Music] [Music] but we'll see I have a whole lot of flowers still to review I have true leaves Green crack Sour Diesel and gorilla grapes carrier Leafs Afghani flower all of those will be coming about the next week or so I have the gold that I'll be coming out tomorrow that's pretty much it until next time [Music]", "GDkzH2Blhdw": "Ella dreams calm dreams about Lotus are not very common but when you have such a dream it could be as a result of

from Amman [Music] [Applause] before we get started I would like to thank the guys that happen who sent out the moonlight wax paper eyes er that we're reviewing today if you'd like to learn more about having products please check out the website on the screen or in the description of the video now here's what comes in the box you get an additional element a cleaning brush a USB charging cable you also get an instruction manual a dabbing - as well as the moonlight the vaporizer box unit itself now let's take a closer look at the unit the unit has the power button on the side it powers on with five clicks it has four heat settings indicated on the side as well as a nifty little storage container that rests on the bottom of the device it's a coated with silicon so you can put your wax or your concentrates inside of that and store it which is a nice little companion piece to have alongside the vaporizer itself underneath the glass dome you find the splatter guard that covers the removable and replaceable heating element we'll take a closer look at that heating element later the first list power on the unit you do that with five clicks and then with three clicks of the single button you can cycle through the four different heat settings you also see that USB charging port right there in the front that's a microUSB charger and then the unit itself the heating element powers on by holding the button for one second and that'll turn on the kind of unique looking little skillet element that's inside of there and the coils of that element heat up that's what's gonna vaporize our wax right there and so we're gonna power it down now it's got a 60 second automatic cutoff but you can override that by holding it for one second and cutting off the power but then of course when you actually use the element when you actually use the device you're gonna use that little wax the splatter guard there and then the glass dome on top of it is also the mouthpiece and that brings us to the funnest part as always and that's gonna be to test this out with some wax we're using some crumble and some shattered we've fully charged the unit and I've gone to the instruction manuals I'm loading it about a quart of the way full with wax at the moment kind of a smaller bowl and I want to test that on high the first time through and the flavor is pretty good the hits aren't necessarily that big when you when you hit it straight away like that but there's another way that you can use it because it stays on the whole heating the heating cycle I found it easier to just kind of set it down between the heats and it lets that skillet heat everything up a little better and then just pick it back up and hit it now found their hiss to be a little better that way but overall I'd say the hits were kind of a little underwhelming but the taste was really good and there was also some issues with ponding of the wax and we'll talk about that in a second now but for now the pros and cons of the moonlight concentrate vaporizer I'd say that the pros are has that cool storage bin underneath it now it's really easy to operate it straightforward and the instructions aren't clear and the nice for heat settings are nice and then it has that cool discreet box mod look so you could probably use it in public and people would think it was a box mod but the cons are is that it's got that ponding of wax under the element it's not very efficient in that way because the wax can fall through on the bottom of the element and stay in there and then it doesn't have the biggest puffs in the world but overall I'd say it's a good entry-level vaporizer I'm giving the moonlight concentrate vaporizer from Atman three-and-a-half stars if you'd like to learn more about it please check out the website in

on", "Z0Na_EHdCq8": "Yatta that you already know what it is welcome back to my channel was probably so today I'm just smoking this backward it did really I'm just answering one of my most asked questions as a STONER so of course they always ask me how many grams you smoking today how much you smoking today that's one of the most questions most wait what I'm sorry guys listen I'm high right now so listen that's one of the most questions that I get asked sorry I can't talk I don't know why but look so that's one of them and another one is oh how high is your tolerance you know what I'm saying but the main one that I always get is bud or oil basically they're asking me would you rather choose bud or would you rather choose some of this oil right here now I wanted to make a youtube video or we - video where our our post is whatever the case is I just wanted to make a video for y'all so for the people that want to ask me they can get my answer right here so I don't always have to answer you guys a hundred times you know saying but listen this is my answer bud or oil my explanation he all is this I love oil because of the way it smells you know I'm saying I could heat up a a rig real quick quartz cows or something boom take a nice dab with some rosin or some live resin you know I'm saying [ __ ] tastes good [ __ ] gives you a different high you get a body high from oil just like edibles edibles and oil gives you body high this bud it gives you a head change you know what I'm saying so like I was saying yeah I can take a nice dab with some oil flavor nice train all right or I can roll up a backward or join or soar swisher whatever load of bong up you know the same your choice is smoking however you do it I can do that I love the way we looks but all I love to look at it I love the smell of it bro sometimes I hate breaking it down because it looks so good the note is so beautiful you know sound I don't really like breaking it down but you got to smoke it you know saying so but this is my answer to y'all bro I'm gonna pick a bud people asked me if you had to choose between a pound it'd be like this if I had to choose between a pound of Bud between a pound of oil I'm gonna take the pound of Bud you're saying I'm saying or whatever the case is whatever is equivalent to the pound of whatever you know I'm saying oil wise I'm gonna pick bud and this is the reason why first of all I got bud you can make oil out of bud you see this bud right here this bud right here I could turn this bud into oil you see what I'm saying this oil is by the [ __ ] rosin right y'all see it so gelato all right you see the gelato I cannot turn this rasa in this oil into bud I cannot make a butt out of this there's no way you're not going to get plant material out of this you see what I'm saying so say I said I was sitting on some oil right I'm sitting on oil and I'm like bug you know I'm taking dabs all day all day I take dams and a month looking like this I'm on my head man I've been getting I'll be getting my body hollowed and getting our body an hour all day no I want a head Shane you feel me I want to smoke some bud but you don't have nobody to smoke you see what I'm saying because you chose oil now say you're like me and you choose bud but I got a pound of this bud right here bro a pound of it I smoked [ __ ] an ounce of it [ __ ] another ounce another [ __ ] else I smoked a pack whatever I smoke three joints of it I'll smoke blunts of it right next thing you know I'm like [ __ ] dude I want to take a nice dab real quick I don't want to smoke no blunts or no joints I want to take it on ballroom I want to take a DAB what are you doing you just have bud you could turn your bud you can simply grab a hair strainer get it hot press the bud and turn that into oil you see I'm saying so then I can take a DAB Oh some oil with bud I can take a DAB with bud if you're saying you can't you can't smoke a blunt with oil you say I'm saying so my answer to bud or oil is gonna be bud all day because I could get oil from bud and you can't get bud from oil you out of the year you already know what it is teacher dabs in the build the out of a matter of fact I'm about the smoke dresses badly with y'all I know is it the question let you know hey if you have some more questions for me y'all want me to answer some more questions on here for

"hi i'm colin and i'm bert this is dabbing with washington artists the idea is simple six questions and six dabs as we get to know the artists behind the art that makes washington washington so sit back and light those torches because this is dabbing with washington artists we're the fractal face thank you for watching the washing dabbing with washington artists um she's gonna give you uh be sure to check us out at thefractalface.com and we're also on instagram and tik tok and facebook you can check it out for today's series of dabs we will begin our smoke session with a bright berry a grape ape and a jack skellington and we will end the session with a bruce banner a blue magoo and a black jack so welcome to dabbing with washington artists today we are joined with the fractal phase which is a fire performance troop um thank you guys for coming thanks for having me yeah awesome so we're going to get right into it starting with deb number one we uh we have bright berry bright berry is an indica dominant hybrid known for its unique taste of roasted nuts mint and blueberries and its cerebral high we picked up a gram of this wax at a shop on 88th avenue in tacoma perfect and then yeah different challenges different challenges but it's a lot of fun so let me get this swapped out real quick yeah that's really good nice so man you guys got me excited what i mean i'm gonna be honest what i'm really excited about is finding one of those yeah you guys pick that up i can make sure you guys get the website yeah yeah um the only part about it is like everything in the mail takes forever at the moment yeah yeah worth it show me what you got that episode that looks like one of those potatoes that's awesome there we go that was pulling it into the chamber there you go beautiful kind of pretty tasty morty madness perfect yeah all right so for the first question uh one we'd like to ask pretty much everybody here uh what role does cannabis play in your guys's creative process you know gets me out of my head because i overthink things and lets me feel it and that's when i can connect to flow easier okay okay perfect um they're pretty much on the same line so yeah it keeps me it yeah it gets me out of my head and gets me more thinking on what i'm trying to accomplish because you know life is life right yeah you have to continue on trying to also improve with these other things i mean they're not like challenging but they are not physically challenging but definitely mentally challenging for sure you know what i mean so it uh definitely helps out if you're building blocks on your flow if you're trying to go past it you know because you can look at your flow as kind of like a mathematical equation too you know start building things together with your grid yeah when we're doing it or if we're doing choreo and working together and timing and yeah when i get excited it helps me slow down because otherwise i go too fast and i'm like what am i doing so i have to have that moment of all right what am i doing this is what i'm doing but i'm also a daily smoker i use it a lot for bodily functioning and pain absolutely so when i am not in pain i can create more yeah exactly yeah i get really bad stage right okay so i mean like she said i actually i literally had to take a dab before i came here oh for sure [Music] out of my head and actually into a space where i can perform where i can focus on you know the task at hand what i'm doing um yeah creating enjoying what i'm doing um enjoying you know the music that's playing or the company of the people i'm spending with whatever aspect of it absolutely it it gets me out there that's cool and so i assume that you guys tend to smoke before performances then there's a fine line because you like we'll smoke before we leave the house when we're like prepping and like pre-funking type of thing but there's also depending on the gig for professional and what kind of environment that we're in we'll determine on when and how much and you know where we partake we have another troop member who doesn't smoke at all okay so you know it's we're all just doing our personal uh levels of happy so sometimes excellent yeah but a lot of the pre is individual after we'll sit down like all right smoke bowl so uh moving on to question number two we have uh a grape ape [Music] is an indica dominant strain known for its rich fruity terpene profile and tendency to leave the smoker couch locked we picked up a gram of the sugar wax at a shop on 128th avenue in everett i had a buddy who tried to bring me some strawberry pops in the same day i had bought and some strawberry cough for myself and he bought the low shelf and i bought the top shelf so she's like i'm just gonna thanks buddy love you you're there what did you say bible [Music] it's good flavor i use pot um anxiety like makes my stomach into a knot and i just want to relax how was living in washington uh influenced you guys creative process i used to be in the military and traveling around i felt it was like it's out there but i feel like it's hiding more outside of like the pacific northwest in california like our art it's there but it's like you know smaller pockets where like you can come to seattle or anywhere in the northwest or portland even you know and you're like boom you go to a park and there's going to be someone spending fire there you can make some friends there or something where like you go to indonesia well that's when you pick up the random friends on the beach though you know it's hard you gotta like dig or dig deeper on the east coast that i found you know it's harder to find because they're more unless yeah you've got to know and if you didn't know and you just show up to a space you're not going to be able to be like okay i can go to a bigger city but even if you're not in a bigger city because i know tons of like amazing flow artists performers that live in nowheresville that you wouldn't even know about that throw festivals out there that you wouldn't even know about oh yeah so i i grew up on the east side of the state where it is a lot more quieter than po donkey type thing where there wasn't anything happening and so i got sick of nothing happening and i made my own stuff happen yeah where i produced my own shows and did all those kinds of things because i was tired of not having anything happen so moving to this side of washington is pretty much what i came here to do is this like i came here to do these kinds of things these two guys actually so they drove for another troop that we're also in but they drove how long from clarkston six hours drive so i once twice a month all the way here to bothell oh wow yeah so i i used for an hour and a half to practice on a thursday evening and then would drive back to clarkston that night and or friday morning sunday usually sometimes sometimes we really tried to make it so that we could stay for the weekend so it was really worth it but here's the deal with the other group though they do this thing that's like a probationary thing because they're much larger group with us being a smaller group it makes it a little bit different with the way that we work things with the bigger group like there's an audition thing and there's a probationary period where you really prove if you're going to work well with that group because when you're working with a large group like that it makes a difference there's a lot more opportunities to butt heads oh i imagine oh yeah and so instead of being able to be here and go through that probationary period and spending the time and going through those challenges of learning my personality with all of them my challenge was to try to make it over here once a month for practice yeah so i was i did my audition in pasco washington i had a event called radcon it's a sci-fi convention down there i'm familiar with it nice so i did my audition at with the fire troop there for their little their evening thing that they do and i remember afterwards i was at their little after party and the leader of that troop was like so uh i think you could make it to like one practice a month and i was like 300 plus miles once a month i don't know it's 600 because you got to count one direction we had to come back so it's 300 directions yeah roughly a year probably right around eight months before we started the making the move over here where we got him a job and then um we were in a transition there where he was here for a couple months and i was in clarkston because i was in a production of chicago so i had to do yes thank you so i had to do practices and all of that and make sure i got through my show before i can move over here so i stayed home and packed the house while he was over here setting this kind of stuff up oh yes okay so for our third dab we have jack skellington which is our first activist for today jack skellington is a sativa dominant strain known for its uplifting and energetic high and distinct taste of sweet citrus and diesel we scored a gram of this wax from a shop on 112th avenue in everett that's really good mad hatter so for number three um a lot of your acts incorporated martial arts movements and weapons um did any of you uh have martial arts training before you guys got into any of this or is this kind of more something you guys picked up uh as you were uh training to do the fire mostly the one who's not here so so my partner nova though she does more like uh what are the two sticks to um screw this thank you she knows a lot of the screaming sticks and they've done a lot of the sets too which we with our other troop we also do on fire as well which is super fun uh and she's done some like sword work and everything like that um for a little while not as much as she wants like uh it's when she grew up in it though didn't she her dad was heavily involved in it but more with uh horseback riding and archery yeah that's what nova was more a part of because her dad's a hypnotist that's awesome what how did i not know this her dad's a hypnotist so he would go around and like he also has a whole bunch of stuff they would do uh archeback uh horse horseback archery archery on horseback respect archery thank you um horse factory hurst battery yes but uh so that's more her sca not as like the fighting thing the fighting thing was more afterwards kind of a thing so she does not have a lot of formal training like i have a lot of like jiu jitsu and like muay thai and as well just because my searching i had friends i was like hey you're my weight size come let's do the thing i'll show you some things well your military training gave you other stuff yeah well yeah i mean the military was like you know he took the cqc and it was fun it was more kind of just not it was restraints more than like actual fighting you know don't lie it helps in our formations too oh no walking and marching is a whole difference that's when we're making sure yeah like that oh it's just like when we're performing and things like that it really helps that i can be like poop addressed the line and he's like yep a lot of those uh routines and stuff tend to look like kana's to me so yeah yeah because i did karate for like eight years oh yeah absolutely you know so they always they kind of nags at me whenever i see it it's like oh man that looks just like a form i would have maybe tried to do a little fancier but yeah one like with rope dart too i learned because that's that was the first prop i ever actually picked up because i kind of like kind of turned my nose up to poi because everybody spits away it's beautiful it is really pretty it's just not my cup of tea it's cool it was the popular vote i think about it like what's on the radio when you say i spin fire they go oh so you've been played those are what people know i just like i said not my company but it's also very good if you're if you don't know what to start with poi is a very direct one oh yeah it's definitely given you can transition the moves like once you learn to employ you can pick up another prop and do it with other things it was not my entrance but it is a common entrance into flow arts i think nova is the only one that does poi in this group yeah but with like i said the rope dart it's got like i knew about its martial form before i knew about its fight even if like people spun fire i knew about rope dart back like like uh was that uh shaolin knights i was going to shanghai shanghai and that's like that's what really is it's just this crazy combat weapon and when you see somebody else take it and not just use it for combat and use it more as you can play with it and have fun with it inside of its pattern you're like oh wow okay that's addicting that's addictive that's the big thing is crazy it's just choreographed art piece that is so amazing and i was like i was shocked just by like how do you wrap my head around how they were gonna put it all together and then they did it i was like wow it's hard to clean for sure it was hard and it turned out really good i'm happy how well we killed it so that's great as far as formal marshall training i think i have about seven hours of instruction with german long sword and about about 40 minutes of rapier but other than that pretty much all of mine is uh self-taught stuff and stuff i've picked up like pumbaa sparring with friends um i used to i used to spar a lot with a buddy who uh was into kendo okay that was just i don't know we usually went like you know 85 whatever type of thing but uh i've had a bunch of friends that were into like mma and stuff and they're like hey spark with me because you're lanky and it's like uh all right don't don't don't hurt my ribs don't hurt me um with like the rope it helps that our tools are kind of fashioned after those marshall weapons like i just picked up a new one that's called the vidarchakar and it's uh oh man it's dance defense for blocking arrows yes well you spin it and it fans out and so it like spins like this and so it is meant to deflect arrows but you can also like go forward and so it goes like this and it can use to deflect and hit people as you're moving through the ground on fire my plan is to do my the gigs that we're getting right now as i as we're doing them the money that is going towards my next prop is an led but your car and then so i have my my day my led micro daytime slash blacklight and then my led and then hopefully by all of that time i will be ready to do the fire one because that one is well and even just the practice one like when it hits my shins it's like rock like it is yeah you don't get hit by one oh no definitely one of my most painful tools and i've dropped a six foot flag on the top of my head multiple times and it doesn't compare to getting hit by those stupid 3d printed balls or whatever the heck they're made out of i'm not soft plastic i like paint but then i was like oh my god these are like hard like really hard like it's coming at you like you gotta do like racquetballs or something like that they're hardcore rubber it'd be nice but you're pushing it away no it's just hard plastic you play with it in three sections [Music] the three sections that's one of the only ones that i saw in your things that i've actually used before they're not easy they're really not easy like i never got good at it actually that's all pretty much self-taught um there are a couple i found like a lot of videos but there's really not a lot of fearless uh oh yeah yeah jellies oh yeah yeah yeah well and that's a lot of what it is it's like all right kiwi kung fu movies because to even get that tool for him because i was performing and he used to just help like he would help me organize me because i'm a mess most of the time so he does a lot of that for me i saw one of those at like paradiso or something yeah it was one time it was 2014. one time ever i saw one person and he was spinning a a fire three section stack contact which means he was doing it on his body yeah he was okay he was like wrapping up his body and he was doing top of hands or anything else he was like laying on the ground and doing like the thing where you like swinging underneath your shoulder and you're like and i for some reason when i saw that i was like that i'm gonna have one of those i don't know when i don't know how but i'm gonna have that in my life someday right and here i am six years later or something like that and i'm two two years into uh practicing with that tool nice so that was a lot of fun i love it it's so much fun alright so for number four we have bruce banner bruce banner is a sativa dominant hybrid known for its kick of energy and tendencies to leave the smoker chatty and social we picked up a gram of this crumble at a shop on 88th avenue in linwood ready to go yeah right you smell it and taste it smell it [Music] uh yes this one this one is a hybrid one yeah this thing is usually a pretty solid pretty good one yeah all of our hoops huh what about that yeah everyone moves i like to support her she's one of our local houstonists that just who's been really awesome with all the stuff she's made us and been her customer service is like top-notch she talks to you all the time and you're like hey by the way can we get like an inch polish that can do done here's the thing by the way this is all that's happening this is what's going on be there shortly and you're like what awesome that was like prompt and awesome and any questions she just runs her own business out of her garage and killing it she actually does care about what she does that's really great you know because she's not just a prop smith but she's an artist as well so it's like a double whammy of awesomeness all right so for number four uh with coven preventing large gatherings uh you guys have been utilizing social media platforms like facebook live and tick tock um what have been some of the advantages and disadvantages of doing digital shows music uh copyright music like your first training live it's different if you go live and you're talking the whole time but a lot of times we're dancing to something so we will have to find ways to like block out the music to not get confident because even when it's like we buy it on itunes which is generally when you perform you but you purchase the song you can use it to perform with um you do that when you you know when you even when you do it and you were streaming or stuff like that you your video is still going to get flagged for that song so you always have to be careful of making sure that you go to copyright and like this song is by it's always making sure you're crediting people like we're doing live non-scripted music not planning for that so but we are um doing like finding ways we'll take video and we'll make it so that the music makes sense and we're finding ways around it so that we can still like put content out and show people well it's nice that we have that outreach still today yeah that's our best one of the clear advantages is yeah we still get to get our art out there and actually technically it gives us a wider audience because i mean facebook is worldwide so we have the potential for anybody to see it i think it's it's growing our community as well because as as we're growing we're building our website and we're thinking of different things to put on our website and so that means that we're putting people on there that we work with like our dj friends that will make music for us so that we don't have to worry about copyright stuff that makes it really just personalized to us or again the people that make our art yeah supporting are the other artists that help us in the process because i mean honestly it's a collaboration of everybody you know you know without music i don't i mean you can always flow and have fun without music but then when you have that music that really like hits you you know you just are stuck you know you just like it and you can just go have a bunch of fun and you know you are confident in your props that you have because your props must slap them together and you're like here you go dude have fun finding photographers or like that her partner has been one of the people that have contributed to a lot of our photos in on our sites she's been doing a lot of the managing of our sites yeah it's like power it's amazing as a freelance steve summers having her do it for us i'm like thank you all right so for number five uh we have blue magoo yeah yeah this is uh more of a crumble it's pretty cool is an indica dominant hybrid with a rich terpene profile of berries and fruit and is known to leave the smoker couch locked and relaxed we picked up a gram of these diamonds in a shop in glenwood super yummies it smells sweet yummy blue magoo someone made one of my favorite stains so oh nice yes i haven't enjoyed this one i'm a fan if i find it i buy a lot i feel like a bunch of children unsupervised without knowing [Laughter] is we'll probably see her after this and we're sitting there with a gig coming up and i have to sew my costume that's nice that you guys are actually getting gigs uh especially with pokemon yeah the gig that we have is going to be a virtual machine oh cool yeah we're giving them a video of already a pre-recorded performance and then we're going to sit down and give them well i think the q a is no longer right so we're doing like the demonstration and talking about ourselves okay so we have a few topics that i have that we should talk about all right so for number five uh we noticed that many of your dance routines are done to an eclectic range of music um how does a musical uh genre or other art genres uh influence your choreography uh choices in your routine um when we're choosing for gigs i like to choose songs that will pick a theme if there is some kind of theme like that um otherwise when we're choosing to just like spin it's a lot like what drives us yeah that you like whatever you feel okay um i like everything on social media i will post what's popular mm-hmm uh because of that like hashtag algorithms it is interesting to like watch a video to and what you really like and then every once in a while one of the just popular ones gets thrown in because it like matched to whatever you were doing perfectly yeah then as far as writing choreography goes um the when it's i have to write it quick the easier simpler stuff is always something where it's like pop songs um stuff you hear on the radio where it's really catchy it's really just really it's a solid 4x4 or really four counts of eight four counts of eight four counts of eight or if you or any kind if anybody does any music composition it's like first chorus verse bridge chorus chorus basic song yeah i feel that did you ever get into any more like complex music like yeah we're trying to get like 11 minutes like just epic or something oh yeah absolutely fantastic yeah like the first time you do something on fire and you want to do it a few times because make sure it's not a fluke yeah like you know okay like how did that feel the end getting that muscle memory down um and so and then like connecting it into your flow what else can i do how do i move from here and so having a long song when you're practicing is preferable especially if it's a really good one having a long song versus different songs can be an advantage when you're writing depending on your group size so when i'm writing for a group of like 50 having one long consecutive song for me to be able to just move people in and out helps with transitions and it helps it from looking chunky visually and with us it can also help an individual like we say somebody is like i want a half hour of a vacation island type thing i can go online and find some kind of or i can message one of my dj friends but like hey i need something that feels like i'm on vacation for a half hour and he can just send me something that i can spin to and sometimes it gets kind of complex where you get those off beats and stuff like that but we because we listen to that often it's fun for us we get to find those little pockets it makes it makes us stand out a little bit more nice our group piece is our longest choreo too like how um our creative flow gave us the most amount of minutes when we're building together i felt like that one built up quicker and filled in faster than some of the other ones i feel that maybe we were working on it more i don't know no no it's easier when it's more of us because there's that creative pool you know you're all just applying it too and everybody if you find yourself on that rut of it everybody's just like well well i want to do this and you're like okay well if you do that then i'll just do this [ __ ] okay we're also pretty well used to being individual spinners yeah each and every single one of us so when we do get together and we re-record all of us or we watch it we're like it's really exciting that we're all together and doing the thing yeah all right so for number six uh we have blackjack which is uh this one comes in the form of some caviar diamonds blackjack is a sativa dominant hybrid known for its kick of energy and tendencies to leave the smoker chatty and social we found a gram of this diamond sauce at a shop on 174th in arlington that tastes really good yeah this one's my favorite just as far as overall high and everything too [Music] wonderful mom's excited yeah yeah burn it out yeah you guys are able to be here yeah i appreciate this a lot for you sometimes oh yeah that would be a lot of fun absolutely yeah yeah the diamonds take a little bit longer than the regular and yeah i know some open cbd's i'm sorry um all right so for our last one um many of us grew up with uh kind of the old school performance groups like uh uh troops like um barnum bailey's you know the circus the ringling brothers uh do you see any of the old performers uh influencing your work today um or is this uh kind of more like modern take on on your performance art kind of common column b yeah they say it's a fair trade of both i definitely like to go to the old school costume i enjoy it a lot old-school circusy costumes but you can always you can always take old-school costume and throw the new school steampunk into it and then you have your own style into it yeah right the cabarets are so much fun because you can still take that and well i mean i don't know i'm just like running just straight cabaret for everyone uh for for at least most flow artists there is at least a little bit of i want to run away and join the circus i can see that and and i feel like that is kind of like the core of the of of what we want what we try to do i think you see it more in the acro aspect of performance troops um because you know the old school like that big oh my gosh they're like way up in the air and they're doing those things and stuff like that um i think that's where you see a lot more of that connection from the old to the new yeah and that's a really good example of the old to the new because of what they've been able to accomplish now that you would never have seen in circuses back then like the rings the lyras and stuff like that and the ways that they the girls can dance on those i'm in the middle of getting there i'm taking a poll acro class personally and i want to be able to get up to like silk and lyra but you have to start somewhere so nice um no matter what you see like patent passing with juggling and everything it's just fun to do and it's fun to watch people throwing clubs at each other just is great and when you add huge patterns to them i do batons so that goes right in there juggling and baton has got a pretty old history as well that they do is pretty like they've been around yeah they've been doing it for thousands of years yeah yeah you can see fire eaters and fire breathers throughout history so you've got a lot of the spinners where theirs is just a different kind of style theirs is more about that technical speed and the cool little things they can do where are they more is that something where does that kind of come from what the tech based stuff is hard on it and wanted to give a language to something that wasn't there kind of like that i think yeah we're just telling you because having kind of like it's just kind of so there's uh what we'd call a grid what you would work off where you put your hands where your staff goes and stuff like that and sacred geometry okay you can build all of these shapes doing like anti-spin flowers and that would if you were to do that and like slow down led and create like this four pedal flower things right you know i love it like mathematical like it's totally for real yeah you have to break it down because there are points where you just go to and you're like oh if i have my prop this way with my hands at this point i can go to this point and then like oh but then i can go to this point but then i can go to this point and then like weird oh there's another point in this grid because there's this whole river out and like in her head uh thinks these patterns and get home she gets someone maps them out and then like makes big videos for them and teaches that's really cool and i love her brain and i'm like this is definitely geometry and quadratic he had a mat down with the greedy staff or double staffs and it was all on the points and he had the entire class build the grid with our double staff so it was this box that we made that was like four staffs high four staffs wide by four staffs long and you can see he's like you can put your staff if you stand in the middle right here you can put your stick everywhere in this part and you can be everywhere you want to be and be in it's opposite you know you just got to know how to get there and what move gets you there and he's like there are here's the handful of moves let's go over everything and like from that breaking that down and being like holy [ __ ] and then it opened my double staff like just i don't know you play with a little bit and you're like that way and then oh go that way and then stop wait hold on i can go that way and then yeah before you know it you're sweating and two hours have gone by and you're like i've been in my living room what is my life doing that was awesome from a visual standpoint when you think about breaking it down it really cleans everything up so if you're thinking about like having your arms out this way like you really want to make sure you're at this angle and this angle because if you aren't at those two angles it gets broken and it doesn't look as neat between each individual person it doesn't look as pretty per se yeah if you've got the ocd like and while you're in the living room figuring this out your neighbor is sitting there going why do they hate their walls so much where the little girl across the street is just enamored hi hi hi yeah that's awesome we put on a show for the neighborhood yeah that's right yeah pretty much anybody who goes by when we're spinning and stuff like that stops um i mean yeah you imagine we get pretty frequently we'll get people like what are you gonna do like if the cops show up and it's like uh answer their questions because they're gonna ask some like uh how do you do that they're totally different though when you're performing and cops roll up they are enamored and they have no idea what's going on and they literally just stop and then they stopped watching that's really cool because there's something else really cool hey guys thank you so much for joining us on another episode of dabbing with washington artists make sure to share with your friends and click like and follow below for more great content also check the links below for the more information about the artists and some of their current projects do it do it do it do it do it now", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a

checking out some wack BlackBerry cush shattered some sap from shatter bros this stuff as I hear over there in the jar it's not shatter yeah what I like most of all this stuff is how the smell comes out no but what makes this just definitely has their method down brings the smell to strain we also have some jack herer for that that smells so so pungent like Jay but this BlackBerry push was pretty far as well really really digging the color on this and the textured textured as you guys can see here I mean it's not a true representation of the texture because it was a little sunny out I like to get the close-ups in the Sun so you get the best representation of the color but you know oil like this it kind of gets to tends to melt up a little bit yeah and that's what kind of happened it definitely has a shadowy consistency to it before you before you do anything to it you know after we you know ended up mixing it all together there kind of in a ball to show you guys consistency I went through it in the freezer before I was able to dab it again because it did get hot pretty quick so smoothly right no my ass is usually look often off this stuff it just goes down I can still it's gonna come [Music] neighbors I guess to try to Bing this video oh yeah how was that how that was a flavor definitely really good flavor still you know I feel like a lot of you gene hashes tastes all the same but definitely got good flavor on it dad ready no damn pro move right there but I like most about it is the smell and the texture no it doesn't like do crazy things off the nail too it just melts really nice definitely got a good perch on it yeah I'm taking that that flavor for sure really really really sweet something that I kind of associate with blackberry sometimes but not that sweet I mean that's really really sweet I'm not sure what if we lock me up there but I'm not sure what the string and the crosses and breakers off the top of my definitely digging it tastes like fish tends to be one of those strains it's always really really really frosty looking it almost always looks the same every time I see it one of the most consistent uniform strains okay I would imagine that would be really good for hash making because it is so for also cake though when we apologize for some of the noise in the background see if you guys remember our outdoor vids from last year we do you ever read several hundred feet behind motorcycles go by every once in a while so pardon us if it gets a little bit loud yeah like you were saying all those blackberry pitches is all the flowers this definitely smells just like all those batches of blackberry curseth I've had at least around in the Senators I'm really feeling that kicking it's kind of a little bit of a forehead punch actually yeah I'm feeling it really set in right here in the last like 30 seconds or a minute that feels pretty goofy definitely hit feeling - laughs - laughs lapping up that coming in as I take this last little dab here and then I'm gonna go ahead and rate it the consistency is perfect right now I mean I would still consider it a shatter but it's way more almost like a tree sap right now that I can really just kind of pick out as much as I want and I'm not taking it everywhere I mean are you taking it in the beginning of the episode in my opinion that butane hash oil doesn't get much better than this nugget flavor just on point the textures on point no shadow bells and stuff there their method down for sure I like the Jack Herer a little bit better but since we already know the BlackBerry fish I'm gonna have to go nine a nine point nine point two what did she like better about the jack we did we smoked most of that already we're not going to get a every for review down of that one for you guys but that like we said earlier just smell like ass you just check past the team I was like damn that smells like Jack besties with the lid often told you to guess what it was and I was like Jack Herer and then I smoked something like damn that tastes like a flower I think that's pretty fair rating I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a nine point two as well some of the best are all I've had in a while for sure definitely sounds really good gives you a little bit of anxiety panic attack it's nice guys fun session for the CCC I'm Shane I'm Dan", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "_-RbkBdl5XA": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some chatter from sir Tara it's from their float line of solid concentrates and flour I'm gonna see what the stats are it's the Blackjacks train I've never had that one before it's 66.1% THC and point four one four percent CBD let's get a look at it see what it looks like one nice big ol dark amber glob of wax in there are shatter I should say there's not much smell to it no much smell to it at all I mean I don't really smell anything let's see what it weighs and tear out that paper well that's nice alright see make sure this is chaired properly yeah it looks like we got one point 1 1 8 1 point 1 1 7 grams so that's cool there you go cut a little bit over can't complain about that keeping it some better looks at it so as you can see it's a very clear but dark amber concentrate it is it is clear but it's dark so I'm not sure exactly why I don't know if that is because they use alcohol I don't know if they use co2 I'm not sure there's no okay well there you go it shatters do that again nice and it's got that same consistency that I liked out of the other sort error shatter that I got and that is that it's like was it pullin snap or you can pull it and snap it really convenient for dabbing as you can see I can work with it with my fingers and not worry about it getting totally everywhere you just take these little bits off by rolling it around on your fingers well then I'd say now all we can do is get some of this stuff vaped up what I like to do is take it and break it up into little dab balls that are ready to go see I'll get a few of those made up get a couple decent ones that's pretty good the last time I did this I think I made four of them and I only ended up using three of them that's a nice one right there so you see how easy this is to work with compared to some I've had shatter before that's so dry and it's not pliable it just flies everywhere and this pull and snap consistency is just awesome I really like it so working with it with my fingers it's not sticking like crazy you can pull it apart and make little dabs out of it very cool I like it let's give my dad machine over here ready to go I guess I won't need this see if I can pull this off here we'll get this done all right I think I'll start out with bigger ones looks like a decent one right there all right nice people hit a vapor off of that there's not much flavor to it it's got kind of a just this nice flowery flavor a floral type flavor to it but not really intense and it doesn't really stand out that much the dab itself was pretty smooth though like it didn't leave me gasping for air and you know hacking my lungs out so that's pretty cool let's give another dab a try oh man hmm whoo that won't hit me a little bit harder holy cow dang definitely feeling that one whoo-whee I need that cleaned up a little bit all right let's give it another dad oh I think that's probably gonna do it for me holy cow that's pretty intense feeling it on my forehead behind my eyes eyes are watering holy cow you know interestingly it's not making my nose run as much as some strains so let's see blackjack is a cross between black domina and Jack Herer by sweet seeds Jack Herer is one of my favorite strange now that's kind of disappointing to know that the jacker air is a parent of this and it just has almost no smell to it but the effects are nice really like the effects so far I actually might finish that one you know it's a pretty clear headed medicated effect here like it's not really cloudy it's not really like sedating feels nice so I think I will go for another one a little bit bigger justice just a pinch just a smidge I make it just a smidge bigger that's just a little bit it was a really small one at first all right let's get it up still not much flavor but nice dense paper really decent effects um this is definitely what I would consider more of a daytime stream it's not it's not like that kind of couch lock effect I guess it's what you'd expect from Jack here I'm not sure well what a black domina is I'm not sure if that's you know the sativa or indica but nice effects from it 66.1% it's $60 a Grand Master Terra and pulling snap consistency that's really nice to work with you can snap it you can pull it you can do lots of stuff with alright thank you guys for watching I hope you have a good one", "0Qe8ImrgVjQ": "YouTube what up pushing here this video was filmed last night

from my family store just for something to do put the dog dog super excited bouncing around yeah oh wait you guys [ __ ] rocket that subscribe button hit that like button hit that Bell [Music]", "6-H9X4PEpnY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up everybody - boom axe beats here get up max reviews wouldn't do another medical marijuana review and now this time I'm gonna be doing one back on Africa I had one back yesterday evening actually because I was finishing up my 9 pound hammer and you can check that review out - if you haven't seen it but I went to Africa because I really wanted to try their their concentrate syringes and I went on their website and they had a strain called Durban not sure if it's Durban poison or Durban it just said Durban excuse me so uh seemed that it had ninety three point something percent THC and I was like yeah that's for me that's really so it comes in this bag right here like my whiz from Africa nice little blue bag they got and inside the blue day they have a ziplock a little bag in itself and the way that you open that is there's like a little thumbprint here on the side you just you just press it in and then you go ahead and unzip okay and I have some product facts here tells you you know like what's inside the the products obviously tetrahydrocannabinol and a pure concentrate syringe especially formulated from cannabis plants extracting for medical use and yeah it tells you like how much the active ingredients is the Delta nine and then the 900 milligrams and then you know it says has other ingredients cannabis plant extract and natural terpenes um the only thing that I could possibly say it tells you like what temperature to store as well 68 to 77 degrees is what the window you want to keep it at and as far as temperature wise so yeah the only thing complaints I have of after you is they they don't have like much info as far as other dispensaries or I've been to one other dispensary and that dispensary had um like facts ahead the strain name you know and I just I don't know this is Durbin and it just doesn't have the strain name on it once you buy it so you got to remember what you got it only has a hybrid like the dominance of it so the dominance is a hybrid and it says here 93.7% THC and 0.2% CBD it has the harvest number and it has the lot number and where it was manufactured and it says one syringe I like how they have it in a pill bottle that's cool because it's like it actually looks like medication now it's not just like some you know like some other places have they just keep your liking a pop you know anywhere you know like so you might get pulled over or something and they might think like oh what is this like you know but this is actually like it looks like medication so I like that and yeah just open it and get right into the review this is what the syringe looks like very dark very dark color and trying to get it behind the white so you can see actual actually just get it close up for you guys okay so there it is up close and uh I should give you guys a nice little visual of it and get you guys back in oh yes all right so yeah we're just gonna get right into it I don't want to say that and talk for 20 minutes but today's different gonna be a new day new day for change here's our the yolk ham and this is what I'm going to be using today and basically uh in the past I've sort of recommended this but now I kind of like full fledge go ahead and recommend this because I actually found out what the problem was what with it I wasn't tightening on the screw so here's what it looks like you open it up you got the Yochanan there and then underneath here you have like your charger you have another atomizer or a Tama I don't know I sit at atomizer I guess you have another one of those and it's basically a cart cartridge that you can fill up with a juice or whatever concentrate and babe whatever you can get in there so today I'm going to be using the coil atomizer and it's basically it's just a coil where you would drop a little dab of this on there and inhale and it heats it up for you so we're gonna go ahead and do that and just so you guys excuse me just so I guys know I took like a very very very very very very tiny taste of this just to see what it tastes like wasn't really trying to get medicated off of it just a little drip I was hanging off the end and I I just like wanted to get a taste so just so I can give you guys like a taste test or a review and I just did that actually before I turned it on so I could still taste it and it just tastes like um I don't know if you guys ever had like edibles or something like that and excuse me it has a UH like a little edible taste it tastes like cannabis really um yeah it tastes like cannabis um but just the THC though not too extra added so uh Warren achar I'm gonna try to do a close-up for you guys where you can see me loading this up so just in case if you guys wanted to get the same product or something similar you can just go ahead and do it the first step that I'm gonna show you guys is uh you don't really need to warm it up too much but if you are going to warm it up this would be the first step really a lot of people warming up with their hand they just hold it in the hand like this or there's like a pen where you can insert this in and it'll warm it up for you just hold the button but me personally I just hold it in my hand like this and I'm from you know where a place where like it snows all the time so this is what we do you just ability your breath in there that you warm the warm breath for about five seconds ten seconds tops and that's it now this comes with a a pull-off cap it's like a unscrewed cap like that and I like to take both of these off so I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'm gonna take both of them off and I see right there it's just these two little one is a cap that holds it screws in and then the the other is the part that it screws into and that secures or fastens the cap screw in so that you can screw it on so I'm just gonna go ahead and remove that completely because and I'll show you why in a second let me just go ahead and move my gimbal okay so here it is and here's the yoke an and here is the atomizer okay the atomizer actually has three one two three yeah three parts to it I'm gonna say so here's the coil I'm trying to get it so you guys can see in there but there is a coil in there and basically what you want to do is you want to let out about this size just a little tiny bit you see that guys that's actually too much but it's a race size and that's what you're said \u00ecdo you just get the right size and you're just gonna want to put it right on the coil there smear it around a little bit on the sidewall that's what you said to do okay try to get you guys okay so yeah so that's what I said you want to do it looks like it's gonna keep coming out so I'm gonna draw back a little bit on it what you want to do is just screws back in and then from there just gonna drop this right in there and it's good to go that's all you gotta do ladies and gentlemen so let's get back into it let's get the taste tester saalu let's see what this is about let's see what the Durban is about some kind of medication feeling it can give us but here this is what in there not really sure how like how long you're supposed up how long you're supposed to hit this for um I just put like a a right sized drop in there that seemed kind of like a lot hmm it tastes good it tastes kind of like the UH I'm trying to think of what it tastes like tastes a little bit like the cartridge that I got from Africa Wow Wow excuse me guys and girls okay well wow what a difference from the cartridge to that holy cow whoa all right sorry guys I am like really medicated right now from that wasn't expecting that at all I've been using something else which I don't recommend that yoga that y'all do and it's do not use the yo can with this it is a cartridge burn as a concentrate unevenly or something it just doesn't give you the hit that I just got yeah I'm I'm good sheesh all right so um I don't know if there's anything like else left in here um or if it burned but I suppose a rice sized drop in there Oh got some smoke so I guess you can hit this more than once out to you after you dab with it did I hit that one kind of taste it a little bit like the granddaddy purp or the now I'm done hammer that hat well I apologize but I'm gonna leave all the coffin in there just so you guys know how how powerful it is hey alright so um wow I'm gonna have to take a minute I'm sorry for like the clicking and coughing and I'm doing like I probably sound like a like one of those tribes you know we're like on a YouTube video wow I just think I might have to take a minute guys like I might only took a minute like cut seriously they're like sheesh I'm gonna have to take a minute and just take a walk for a second Wow Africa the guy even said um David said like be careful when he gave this to me is that you know just be careful because this stuff is really strong so I really gotta be gotta do gotta be careful don't drive honey don't don't think about driving or no and yeah well you're about to take this because it's like I feel completely different like and I feel like I have to take a minute to relax I can just get my thoughts like straight I take a walk or something they oh no this is I wasn't expecting this I suppression or private they took a rice sighs a rice sighs Wow so yeah guys I'll definitely definitely recommend this I don't even know if I'm gonna get anything else like as far as anything to concentrate I did do that I did do the uh the granddaddy purp and nine pound hammer from a difference especially but I didn't do it from this I didn't dab it like this because I thought it was broken because I didn't have it tightened enough I didn't actually have it tighten enough so it wasn't making a connection to the heater coil or whatever it's called and uh it just was acting like it wasn't working it was basically every time I would try to go and hit it it was just doing this obviously was just doing this alright you guys could see that it's just blinking like it doesn't have anything in it you know I mean so when you put something in it though it stays on and I guess it wasn't making a connection so I actually I think her name is Vicki Nikki I forgot she loved to comment just so I could shout you out I don't want to butcher her last name Gillan or Gillian Gillan I think Illinois but Vicki she actually said they hate why don't you try this way and I went ahead and replied back to her like I did try that way but I think it's broken so thank you Vicki for helping me out with that uh for making me like a little bit motivated to go ahead and try it again because if it wasn't for you doing that I probably would not have so yeah definitely try it this way if you're gonna use if you're gonna inhale the concentrate definitely dab it or use it on a coil of some sort because I tried it with the granddaddy purp in a nine pound hammer with the cartridge and it did work confirmed it did work but it wasn't like this at all not at all like I had to take at least like five or six of them pulls like long pulls to feel like I do right now so yeah definitely do it this way um eating it I felt like it went so quickly when I ate it and it took so long to kick in so I just it's just I have a high a high tolerance for a THC so I this way is you know I mean it's like right away you feel the effects and it you know doesn't ease into it and then you know and then damn you hit you like and then you're feeling good it's just I like this so I might uh I might do I might do like some gummy bears or something I don't know we'll see but it was seventy-five bucks guys and it's 900 milligrams so it's not anyone's busy oh man there goes the dog again that's his like morning ritual Oh time to walk me so yeah anyway I'm gonna go walk him but before I do that I'm gonna close with the 900 milligrams it was seventy-five bucks but it is powerful as strong so like I can't do a comparison on the granddaddy apartment 9 pound hammer to tell you that which one was better or which one was more potent but uh because I was doing it out of the cartridge that yocan came with which wasn't the best way so from now on I'm gonna do this I might go back and get something else of the true clear or something but for now this is the Afra and I'm totally impressed with this thank you so much \u00e1free\u00e1 this is the port st. Lucie location and yeah that's it guys thank you for joining if you haven't already like comment or subscribe tell me what you guys would recommend I'm gonna try to do some other dispensaries but these are the ones that are close to my house so for now I'm gonna try their products once I try all their products on maybe go on to the next dispensary who knows but yeah thank you so much guys for your time and I hope I helped you guys out and I hope you I helped you guys learn a little bit about you know the medical marijuana program here in Florida alright guys peace have a good one", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back - true so I have another training review for you guys in this video actually a concentrate review we're going up with a brand trip and we're going over the the wedding cake chatter so here's the package for you that's pretty simple so I'm really not gonna go over it because it's just just a [ __ ] envelope but if you want um there's our social medias right there so you can go check them out if you want to do some more research on know more but every what I mean so there you go on that um besides for that you guys know what [ __ ] wedding cake is I'm sure like everybody does by now she smoked weed I've got one gram of shatter gold wedding cake that's what it says the harvest eight six twenty seven nineteen which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments are for it but besides for that it's been Ronnie ray P so", "8t9CY2PyGK0": "all right peace and riot cannabis academy we are here we're doing a little concentrates 101 vapes and dabs i'm excited about this one you got to kind of put those together because in reality what's inside the little cartridge that you get as there's concentrated you can buy them you know i think in half grams grams at dispensaries and things like that is a concentrate yep i mean we've broken one early on in our and we'll get into that there's a lot of times everything from um is the most basic kind you know make sure that you're subscribed and you have notifications on um by doing that you'll get all the kind of cannabis academy updates at least i mean we've gone over almost all the basics now we'll start getting into guests guest speakers stuff on cbd i mean just all kinds of great things on it um i have to take this down just seeing a little thing on the corner of my eye yeah i'm like oh my eyes [ __ ] it's still bothering me like i could like i've been looking forward to getting into this one since we've been doing yeah academy because i i have a big huge debt so what it is is for everyone that doesn't know because we do forget sometimes it because we do this all the time and it's something we medicate on first of all we're not telling anybody to go and do drugs we're not advocating the sale illegally or anything we're talking about something that is recreational and medical legal here and we both have cards anyways prior to the legality so but we're just saying um this is wax crumble shatter dabs i mean really you can go on and on i'm just trying to associate the names that people might have heard how these things are all made the different levels of them that's that's that's weird [ __ ] man that's i go i'm way more into that one i want the one over there and like which one's strong i want that one yeah yeah how much oh that one's only thirteen yeah no no no no no go up go up higher tier diamonds not yeah you're definitely here i you're definitely a top shelf shopper i'll give you that one i like yeah yeah i like to have once you start really nailing in you know we'll get into that here in just a second the the really terpy profiles you enjoy it's really hard to avoid that and so when you want to get to those specifics you end up having to aim at that time and the terps are for like the land i'll give everyone the layman because i mean yeah i tell you what for everything everything i get into detail-wise you can just jump in with the lavender that is the flavor on the back of your tongue and the nasally like piney look there's a hundred different kinds of terpenes and it's any group of hydrocarbons that produce a certain type of flavor and different different terpenes not only deliver different flavors but different smells different effects and and so you it touches the back your nose some of the famous ones for those of you that are like well what's the term i don't even heard of terpenes before you haven't haven't you didn't even know it sometimes it's in the name of the strain you're smoking if it's lemon og it probably has a lot of the limo lean terpene in it which has that sort of lemon and a citrus flavor and smell to it and that's where you get that that terpene versus taste profile um so concentrate's been around forever yep forever so as far back as as um uh 10 000 bc in china they found um a hash keef mixture which was believed that they would take a bunch of sticky sticky wheat i had a 1990s cali they would take a bunch of sticky sticky weed and they would take a bunch of the keef and they would coat their hands and keef and then they would just rub the sticky sticky buds between their hands like this to all the trichomes would stick with the keef and get this layer of this sticky trichomes um the the trichomes are the sticky little parts and i'll get into that again in a minute too but it's the outside of the bud and that's where you're going to get a lot of the thc content and keef is usually what's in the bottom of a multiple stage grinder it's all the dried parts of that that's fallen off and it's the little crystals that have fallen off and the little hairs that have fallen off of the weed and so that keef is technically a concentrate in and of itself said grinder sorry that keep pretending to concentrate in and of itself but still i wrote it down but they would make that also there and so this this this hashish is is the first you know oldest form of the of concentrates it's been around for a while it's not a new thing but using science and technology we've really sort of perfected it and got into different options with it i actually early on in my years of smoking weed ran into concentrates something called hunting oil back in and so and they often call it co2 oil now they used to just take a normal cigarette and just roll it in this oil and then you would just and it was thc oil that's all it was uh basically they were like making butter for edibles instead using an oil like basically co2 oil is used by using co2 and pressure and and you can then squeeze basically out you can as if you're it's a reverse vacuum you know so instead of going into space where there is no air and then something explodes you're basically using pressure to squeeze out and i remember smoking being like what did he give us and he was like it's just it's just cheese he was like no i would never but but it's pure thc oil and if you're not used to that you're [ __ ] up now i was smoking flower that looked like it came over between rocks now there's too many two main kinds of concentrates and that's solvent and and solvent less or non-solvent solvent means you use you use something or usually a liquid but it can be a gas like co2 you use something to separate the the thc from the weed plant if you use something besides water pressure or heat then it's solvent-based if you use propane butane co2 alcohol like rick sampson oil rsoll super famous been around for a long time it's what they give the the little girls with cancer to give them to stop having seizures if they're epileptic you know it's rso oil we've done we have to be honest you can you can dab our soil you know it will puncture it in the face it will absolutely puncture the face now here's how they do rso oil we're not going to break down into how they do each and every one we'll save that for the more in-depth episodes but just to throw it out there how a solvent one works rso oil is a solvent-based um concentrate and this uh well what they do there usually is you'll get a large mason jar and you'll fill it full of weed an ounce or so and then you put alcohol in there and and the most common one is you do something like everclear and then you close the jar on that you give it about an hour or so and you you a little bit of agitation squeeze and strain and then you take this alcohol mixture that'll be a lot darker in color caramel in color that's dumped out it's evaporated and then what's left over is now your rso oil it's hard to judge exact concentrations amounts is it back bro not only is it back it is solely flying directly into mine just messing with you that one one fly that comes around only when we record and only so the rso oil that's an idea that's an example of solving the fly i am sorry i wanted it was mocking that's all right it was looking at my face most of your solvent-based concentrates are going to be between 60 to 80 percent thc now most of your solvent lists the ones that aren't using that process contrary to popular belief are actually usually equal to or stronger than the solvent-based extracts your solvent-less ones are just the heat water pressure those real real basic ones so like um the most common is when you just take like uh just heat and press you take a little weed put it between parchment paper two hot plates squeeze them together you squeeze hard and out comes the the product right which i want to do like immediately yeah getting that breath um so when you're also looking at these concentrates and you're hearing like the percentages because like i said i i want everyone to be safe and i have to break it down for like the moment by the way if you go and you're getting the vape pens um you're not getting the same the delivery of it isn't the same as if you're superheating it through a any kind of torch or nail or anything like that it's a predetermined electronic temperature coil so you're probably getting in the 30 to 50 range of it's stronger than flour that's why i included it in concentrates you're not getting the same don't think if you are pulling on a pen all the time and that's your way of of you're getting a you're getting a preset dope and then a friend gives you a dab rig that that is going to be the same as this because it's not it's not it's danger it's danger if you think that yeah that's the difference because it's like having a pill and being able to lick the pill every time you want to hit that's your vape pen or taking a pill and crushing it down and being able to snort that sucker all at once which would be the same which would be like would you don't condone in any way shape or form drug use or abuse telling you to smoke weed or concentrate or just given information it's a it's an over exaggeration of the the difference of of extremity between the two classes um oh you got it too so the i might have said extremity oh yeah that moment yeah i didn't i stuck with the extreme no it was good but i would have i could have i saved i might even talk about it i'm just very medicated at this moment so there's the different ways of consuming the concentrates you can either put some on your weed bowl if you're gonna have a pipe that's got flour in it a lot of people will take some of the softer ones like i like like a sugar or a crumble and you can put those down because those have a lower taste so good too does it have a lower uh temperature point tastes so good but usually often even then you won't get the full release of the terpenes in there because you're not reaching that appropriate boiling point or reaching point to release that um each one that whether it's solventless um which is just like i said the heat and water which is your bubble hash your hash your keef your rosin that means you're not using anything but the heat water pressure to get those notes now that's i'm like i need i need to have okay that's okay um um but i like this a lot of the more common ones a lot of the more common ones that are able to produce a desired texture or temperature point or the ones you usually see in the dispensaries a lot more often which is your wax your shatter um your butter your diamonds let me ask you you're gonna get those for a layman like maybe a little advanced layman why is shatter the one thing that's just lesser quality what what is that like just the most basic extract or so and i don't know actually it because it goes through less of a refining process it has more overall plant source material still in there taking up space for what would other be pure thc just the basics yeah it's a really it's a not as refined level of concentration be clear if you don't have don't dab shatter either you will get just a start small and no matter what type you're going to try start with the size of a half of a grain of rice that's that's the tip okay if it's r oil not i suggest you start with the size of half of a grain of rice that's the same that's recommended by uh other people you can check with uh potguide.com i'll put a reference there so it's not me saying it i'm referencing that you according to potguide.com half a grain of rice half a grain of rice of any concentrate type if you're charting it if it's your first time trying it you start with a half a grain of rice size yeah it'll get ripped and that way because you're gonna that's a potent amount no matter what type it is if you haven't tried it yeah us it seems like a half a gram right right because i do i'm thinking about i'm like no no i remember i remember starting off when it was just a tip it could be a little bit just on the end of the tool half a grain of rice would last you three different hitting sessions yeah in the very beginning correct because in the very beginning because we used to i the first way i did it was with um collector collector with a metal chip with a metal tip and it was silicone and so you would just kind of touch it to it yeah no half a grain of rice you're going to be ripped good luck yeah so start with that no matter which way you're doing it you know always start small start safe um start with the flour i honestly would say just from experience you do that little amount but i wouldn't start on shatter you can get pretty ripped that stuff's kind of dirty sometimes i would go like a real low end like crumble batter like get a lower i mean really shatter you can get you got to be careful with crumble because sometimes if it's a really soft crumble and it falls apart really easily huge hit you'll like something like a straw yeah or or the nectar collector is working but if you're stupid inhalation little device and you go to hit that thing like all right so this is it looks like a block let me go ahead and just take this little block and you go and do that and then all of a sudden a little chunk breaks off right up the straw and the whole thing's burning on the way out your necks are collected you can get a much smarter either i would say a scoop into a good i recommend an e-nail yeah but if you especially especially if you're a beginner then hit us up find somebody with an email learn how to use an email the reason being because you preset the temperature in a device and then it it won't burn it because you know for a fact it's going to be at that certain degree it's usually a little digital handheld corded i have one cough because you're not usually burning the dab too much and the reason he says that well not don't cough there's two main types when you're doing dabbing or using a rig which is like a a bong or a water tobacco device um if you're using one of those then you usually have the buckets on the end and you preheat them with a torch or using that e-nail which which electronically you know targets a certain temperature the two ways to do it are hot dabs and cold starts hot dabs usually use titanium nails because you can get them extra hot i mastered those without meaning to master because you just started that way i used to just not knowing everything and just dump everything in get it hot drop it put a spoon or something over the hole and try to survive longer take a second hit before it cools down bubble and lay on the ground like why do people like this like and then be higher than [ __ ] for the next while and then eat a bunch and take a nap and then wake up and do it again yes and i was like this isn't that great but it's so rough on your lungs instead you start by putting the material into the nail or the bucket on the end and then you preheat it slowly from the bottom until you start to reach that desired temperature and then you can hit it just as it starts to reach that temperature and so you're getting it right as it falls in the perfect green zone that has lasers to really to tell temperatures on his bangers i have a terp laser yeah you know how i tell my temperature okay i'll show you a couple different a couple different temperature devices yeah the laser gives you like it's like a rangefinder in golf except for heat here's that one this one right here oh that goes right in the camera i wonder if that [ __ ] with him he has more too i like this one do we have to put up an epileptic warning now at the beginning for the lights and the lasers i did it like 30 times did you i think you had i have used it you absolutely have to put a warning i don't know you have to put it yeah yes think about the other people that watch our stuff for the medication information and then some of them to treat seizures and you're like shining lasers and lights i'm just saying it looks super cool it did look very cool hurt my eyes so for all of you they got to see the warning at the beginning you're welcome uh he's an [ __ ] and that's why peace and right so the other option besides the gun epileptic warnings did you show that uh it's got a i don't know it's it's all lit up there i guess it's too bright it's a laser beam i can't but it shows a digital readout of the temperature you know of of your hand or whatever it is you're shooting uh 93 degrees apparently from here it says it's not supposed to be used on human skin because it's not accurate enough um and that's why but it goes into the plus or minus 10 degrees but you're using this to read in the hundreds and you know 560 640 320. so that's that one the other one here when it plugs in the wall this and plugs into different types of ends or bangers or nails whatever i'm using in that device and this is the email temperature controller this one this one specifically has a timer that will run up and down and then you can preset the temperature and it'll hold that exact temperature for this one particularly up to 90 minutes it'll also increase your medication budget twofold because it's on all the time and you're like oh well done i might as well just put a little bit more in there oh but oh yeah but on the reverse of that i don't think it does i don't think it does much because you waste nothing none at all you get every little bit oh no when it's both of us around you you get that almost every little bit at the exact temperature but i think we're trying to one-up each other all because you can just be like hey let me get a little a little bit more in there yeah yeah no it was it's fun though it's definitely worth the investment it's um so we definitely enjoy having all the support that we've had with the cannabis academy it's important to we always you know safely imbibe because now in the places especially that it's rec legal yeah a lot of people don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing i do want to also add just as a side bonus vaping or dabbing the dabbing vapors versus consuming flour smoke you know uh if you were to smoke a blunt say versus hitting a vape pen the the chemical makeup of of the vapor versus smoke the vapor sticks to your clothing less it it's so that the stink isn't sticky versus when you're smoking out of a bowl smoking flour and sometimes that scent will linger with you um and so you have a fleeting smell it's a very fleeting you'll walk something like cotton candy yeah what who's who had weed candy right now who had chocolate but it's gone and then it's gone yeah well sometimes you'll catch like if especially if you if you can show up right afterwards but no that's so much smelly like and the difference is that it's not a sticky um vapor so it doesn't stick to your clothes and then carry with you like the smoke from you know just no and this is just like a my side for beginners those vapes are just a different beast i don't really think they affect just be careful when judging tolerance just based off hitting those vapes i don't trust a lot of their potencies that you don't know these are hundreds of cartridges made i'm just saying i've smoked just like joints and bowls with people that rip vapes all the time and they get torched because flowers are a little different high or they are always on the vape and they think they do an edible no edibles different than everything don't ever forget that and like the concentrates outside of a vape honestly don't i just think of all the people we've gotten we have absolutely wrecked 20 at least people buy them attempting long-term smokers a lot of them too yeah not we don't ever do it maliciously but people come over we do a lot just don't i consume my normal amounts unless you're with someone that knows what's going on yeah i'm i am a seasoned concentrate user and if you have questions on it i mean if you like concentrates or the vapes obviously hit like and comment on what your strain is through the vape because i like those tasty ones like some of them that actually taste like like sugar cookies and yeah those are so good and that's gone and then we'll get into the specifics of you just sit there how do they make cookies how do they make diamonds birthdays how do they get a white cookie right here batter resin rosin um you know what's live versus not live because you'll see that sometimes it's your adverse lives you know so live is when the the weed itself is actually fresh frozen so it preserves the trichome you can hear that at some point too and one of the bud tenders trichomes are the little white kind of bulbous hair there's actually three different kinds of but think of them as as size small medium large but essentially trichome is greek for the word hair it's the little hairy um collections of thc that hang off the the plant you usually can't see them with the naked eye very much unless the plant is really potent otherwise you zoom in with a camera or something and look at them in a larger picture and some really cool stuff some really cool pictures i love the artwork you'll see out of those trichomes because it just kind of looks like a a whole different alien world when you're zoomed in on those things um they're great but so the the live process stuff is the live process is thought to preserve those trichomes a little bit better and so when you're actually turning it into the the end product you know the better off they start when they go in the more potent it's going to be on when it comes out oh whereas where you're just doing like rosin it still helps making the live rosin which is remember rosin is the one where we're just using heat and pressure to squeeze it together so if you start with the cold frozen wheat that you cured by by freeze for you know freeze drying it then you put that in between the hot plates and squeeze it out then then what you're working with is more potent than the solvent ones which broke it down a little bit to extract it whereas this one didn't get broke down you've preserved it the whole way through the process and so you're gonna get as potent as you can get based off of the flower you started with so if your plant is really potent then a live rosin will get you the most potent concentrate you can get out of processing that down into different forms like a wax which is using it to you know using a co2 or butane to separate it out and then turn that into a material i remember again some stuff years ago years ago the guy was making in his garage wax and it would be on like he drove me off into it probably on the [ __ ] whatever got me high and i would just i would just it would be wax paper you just pull it [ __ ] open and just be the stringiest well before it was garbage he was making it with like his feet or something look before there was but it was [ __ ] stony i'm glad you said that that's to bring up the fact that before they had little glass jars they were super convenient or little silicone jars some people prefer the silicone because you can hit right out of them you don't have to worry about is this glass or just dense plastic plastic one out there like oh this glass or plastic you don't want you don't want it oh no it is oh when you're here yeah i've taken a definite so chemical yeah i usually i usually real good about using glass jars and once i get a good glass jar just kind of scoop everything into that one um instead of using a plastic i don't get out of plastic you know the higher end stuff always comes into them higher stuff comes in a nice splash jars usually a ceramic jar something something nice we're bougie i'm a pain i want you to ever he has one that lights up yeah i do i have some that light up that's not i'm serious local local arizona dispensaries here yeah they have and i like their containers because they have a slightly magnifying lid on the top and then a little led light clicks on the bottom so you get a real good look in the container at the material without having to crack the lid and get a good peek at it you just okay that's looking pretty good i got about that much left you know and i like it that way and so i usually i reuse those often and just you know by the time i wipe them out i just throw another gram of something else in there um but yeah as far as store they didn't always have those so the original the original way to store your concentrate was the wax paper the parchment paper you know it's like a dirty diaper if it gets if it gets warm it'll stick both sides you know um so the benefit for that or the the way they'll say to really manage that is throw it in your little fridge i recommend highly keeping any and all concentrates you get of any form in the fridge the enemy of all concentrates is heat light and air and laying it on keep it sealed keep it dark and keep it cool and so you'll see a lot of mini fridges you can buy that are meant for like dorms that you know they fit six to ten cans of soda perfect mine so tell you it'll fit one case of beer you just well they're perfect little small fridges you know that would fit four or five of these but they're great for stacking your little containers in i have over here like a three-quarter sized actual full fridge that i can just keep like rows and of stuff in but that's because i dab a lot um that's a factual thing it is and with my with my little babies growing over here i plan to expand on my total amount of personal use i'm excited me too we always appreciate everybody jumping into the cannabis academy stuff um man there's so much to take in on all of the two if you have questions on any of the concentrate concentrate stuff definitely you can comment it hit like look forward to our concentrates 102 when we'll get more in depth to each one and beard 710 up on instagram really if you have a question or you know anything in regards to any weed content or the nooch 710 both of us i i have some depth if you want more layman's terms i'm the guy to hit up then if you want like well then you just do that you want to hear more about hydrocarbons then i'm the guy yeah i'm not um i mean no i'm not saying hydrocarbons at any point in conversation right now yeah right now yeah make sure to we'll keep the um cannabis academy stuff coming up uh when you're subscribing you have the notifications on you'll get that in your uh little annoying red thing and then and uh give us some ideas on what else because we're gonna start moving on to more advanced ones and if you think we missed some basics let us know put it in the comments we've had we've had a couple of people put them in there so if you think we missed something drop a line thank you he's been staring at me the whole time the whole time do you want anything you guys should say goodbye say goodbye to the fly everyone say goodbye", "BBsIeYOZWOg": "you have made a trip or several trips to the post office preparing for the holiday and while you were shipping our presents some people were mailing weed here's Denver 7 investigative reporter Jace Larson oh you know it's busy at the post office this time of year and while many of these packages have legal presence inside not all of them do and some of those people that come to Colorado and buy their personal use marijuana and want to ship it home and we want to let people know don't come to Colorado and mail your drugs back home it's kind of common sense but new numbers I received through the Federal Open Records Act show a sizeable spike in marijuana mailings the big increases definitely recreational marijuana became legal in 2014 and the number of people caught trying to illegally mail pot has gone up significantly cents to a whopping 805 last year postal inspectors in the West Metro Drug Task Force caught this guy Steven Anderson sending at least 30 marijuana packages out of state in 2015 and listened to his punishment a federal judge sent him away to a federal prison for a year some of the other package is caught with marijuana were sent between Colorado cities it's still illegal to mail because you're using the federal u.s. mail system and it's prohibited at the federal level some people think they can mask the smell of the marijuana by putting in some coffee grounds other people have tried to use peanut butter people suggest ways to be able to get around a drug dog or to get around the postal inspectors I'll tell you I've seen so many ways attempt and fail inspectors do not x-ray every single package and there's just too many of them to have a drug dog scan each one but there are postal inspectors all over the country so even if the package isn't caught where it's mailed here in Denver it might be caught at its destination Jace Larson Denver 7", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys later", "Sdpn-iHpu_c": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving hope they got most of their Christmas shopping done all right we got a hall from cetera we got another hall I might try to do it tonight or tomorrow I might do a smoke sesh I got a fire burning out back so I might like to roll up a blunt and smoke that let's see what else oh if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the thousand subscriber giveaway coming soon I'm just trying to gather a few more things for it try to make it a little unique as possible you know me so make sure you hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we're trying to grow the channel as quick as we can as fast as we can get as big as we can so make sure you subscribe for all the

go or did you go out and get anything today for yourself some weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "6bzVBb7OjHc": "what's up world before we start this video i just want to thank my homeboy mitch for the seeds that i got i'm going to leave a link to his channel in the description of this video he's the one that woke me up with these seeds the lorraine's breath and they spread it really well so thanks a lot and this video is going to be teaching you how to germinate at home as well and to show you the setup it's nice and clean and ready for the ts2000 i'm going to be setting it up way better with little lights on the side just to get to the buds better and everything else so yeah let's get into this this is where we go all the stuff you can smoke you know you're busting to a paper or you're packing [Music] so i'm starting the germination of the lorena brett the lorena's breath lorena oh if i'm saying it right lorraine's breath i'm only gonna do five right now i'm gonna do five of them and five of the purple cush just to start off to make sure everything's gonna go swell i don't want to mess nothing up so i'm gonna start these off and then when they spro i want to plant them and then i'll come back and finish recording this gonna be a nice little update these are from my friend mitch i'm gonna have a link to his channel in the description of this video and i'll put his name up here on stream too in case you want to just go search it sometime but yeah he got some good grow videos he grows this [ __ ] he grows all kinds of different other strains too so go check him out it was he hooked me up with some of the weed he grew and it was real nice good taste and got me nice and blitzed so go check him out thank you oh and thank you mitch so let's finish this off so i can get the purple kush started as you can see the seeds are sprouted it's been just a couple days so what i'm going to do now is i start with egg cartons i fill them up with soil put a tiny little hole just put your finger in it do a little hole about that drop the seed in it don't mind my hands are dirty from the soil but you take the seed just put it right in the little hole try to have the root facing down like that cover it up yeah i'm gonna take a little bit more and just sprinkle over top of it you don't want to pressure put pressure on it or nothing so the seed can have nice room to sprout and then i just cut these out when they do sprout up and then you can put each individual one in the pot and you're good to go so i'm going to finish this up and then put them in the light let them start growing so this is this part it's pretty easy to germinate seeds somebody told me is one of the hardest things to do and i find it's pretty easy there's a lot of ways to make mistakes but as long as you do a good job use nice good water i used just uh normal spring water or whatever comes in the bottles is what i used check it out they're all sprouted those are all lorona's breath and i got to thank my homeboy mitch for those and he's got a couple giveaways going on right now so go check his channel out too i'll leave a link in the description of this video plus i'll have it on screen for y'all to see but this is the last plant from the last one i'm saying it's just about done so i'm going to give it another day or two maybe and then cut that one down because yeah that's the last one out of them and it seems to be all right not a lot of butt on it obviously there's a small little plant but it's not too bad but i think these ones are going to be champed up and as you can see the room is nice and clean i redid it all waiting for the new light set it all up nice it's going to be a bomb setup i'm super excited thank you mars hydro for everything i really appreciate you guys helping me out with these lights and [ __ ] too and yeah thank all you guys really for helping me out with advice and stuff through this time i think

"hey folks I'm the CBD driver thanks for joining me today if you have not done so so far please subscribe to this channel turn those notifications on and that way you can get up-to-date information on what I have new posts out for reviews or tutorials also give me a big thumbs up if you like what you see and leave a comment down below so that I can give you guys the content you would like to see on this channel ok today's review it's a live resin from Empire Wellness this runs 70 dollars a gram and it comes in at 55 point five percent CBD per 1 gram container this is a great product that ships very discreetly and quickly and when you open up that package you'll see a glass container that has your live resin inside of it it has a screw on plastic top with the branding for empire wellness and extracts on there also the information about this product it says 55 milligrams of CBD and this this live resin is actually extracted from two different strains and that is the ACDC and Charlotte's Web strain both of these are well known for helping with epilepsy the seizures that are associated with that pain discomfort and inflammation now when you open up that size-appropriate container you will see a yellow buttery type of consistency for this live resin it's not sticky and gooey as I was expecting it it's actually a little more moist than a crumble so it's easy to just carve off a chunk of this for putting in your nail putting on a nail putting in your vape pen or whatever you choose to vaporize this with I suggest you grab a glop of this and you throw it on those vaporizers or rigs and you start vaping this stuff now the flavor the flavor I got was mixed but the majority of the flavor I got had a very nice lemons move flavor to it although there was a sweetness in there when I hit this on an electric nail and it had almost like a bubblegum type flavor but I only got that sensation just one time the nice thing about this is even though you use a small amount you can still get enormous clouds so a lot of density a lot of volume with a small amount of material I set my vaporizer pen to the medium setting and it work just fine it is very smooth the exhale also has reminiscent flavors of lemon but it doesn't stay on your tongue that long so it kind of dissipates quite quite quickly now the effects within about a minute I could feel that characteristic heaviness behind my eyes the relaxation in my neck my back my shoulders I just felt at ease and very peaceful and that sensation lasted for me maybe an hour an hour and a half I came back I took some more puffs of this from my vape pen and I was set for another couple hours I really like the product it's a relatively high priced product but I think that might be because you're taking it from two separate strains and with the co2 extraction you're just paying for the processing and where it's derived I have to give this 5 out of 5 on my dabber scale it did what I was expecting it to do the flavor was good it was smooth there was no irritation on the back of my throat no matter what and I just really liked the effects so 5 out of 5 on my dad or skill for this this is the live resin wax from Empire Wellness I will provide a link down below so you can pick some of that up coming up I have some more reviews from Empire Wellness including a 99% CBD isolate with Grape Ape turps and their auto CBD flower this doesn't have any THC but it provides quite a nice feeling when combusted alright guys thanks for viewing again subscribe if you can and stay tuned I'll see you soon", "NbfFlBy57GA": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane coming through today for another concentrate review it's a little wake and bake session for me just got about a half hour ago got another hour before I got ahead into work so I figured I would shoot a quick video today we are checking out a shatter from a concentrate company that we have never had a look at before here on the show this is from incredible extracts this is their Black Label so it says incredibly grown so I'm guessing that means this is their in-house so kind of their top tier product I've heard a lot about Incredibles this is actually my first time trying their stuff and as I said the first time we've had it on the show this particular stuff I got here is some sour band onine sour band is a strain sour band is a strain that I have not seen too much recently but a few years back it was real popular especially the area I was out in Bay Area California there was two shops in particularly out there that I hit that they used to grow the sour band and made a lot of different products from it some really really good sour band full melt but Dan and I used to go to those two places and we would smoke all kinds of different sour band it's usually gonna be a Sour Diesel head band cross I'm not sure what the oh nine is on this one I'm sure there's a few different cuts of it so it's probably just alluding to which cut it is so again this is a sour band oh nine go ahead and get a dab heat it up here guys go back and watch something funny I remember me and Dan doing a really big one time the only the only video on the channel we ever did in an accent I mean we did this our heads full melt bubble hash in a British accent pretty sure that's episode I want to say either 17 or 19 of the actual CCC episodes if you're at all interested or bored you can go back and watch that rocking the Jamie glass client today nice little spinner should give me pretty good flavor you got all cleaned up first out of the day it's always a good one always my favorite day of the day this stuff has a real beautiful look to it it's gone the you know the brown parchment so it's kind of a little bit more difficult to get a true sense of the color I should have thrown it on some white before I did the close-ups but it definitely is a really really nice light color the consistency is what I would call pulling snap these close-ups I took outside it was probably a little bit warmer than room temperature not super hot but you can tell us a nice pull and snap now that I've got two here inside it's definitely a little bit more of a shatter but it does have some gift to it did a nice fat one for the first day of the day yeah when I was doing the close-ups I opened it up earlier and I was smelling it outside I guess that would have been yesterday when I got home from work and when I was doing that close-up sight I took a whiff of it and it smelled good but it wasn't really a strong smell probably because I was outside that wind blowing and everything but opening it and smelling it now it definitely has a pretty good nose on it for just some regular shatter and I don't believe yeah this isn't a why present this is just their Black Label which again is the in-house no Grunch adder going on a DAB here this sour band [Music] I love them I find just the right place to film the video where I got the light coming in from the right direction we're gonna blow a cloud out it just smokes you guys out like the cool super smooth I didn't get a whole ton of flavor off of that Deb it was definitely like a nice subtle kind of more of like a creamy flavor the flavor I got off that dab wouldn't remind me of a sour or a headband there's gonna be you know more of a usually more of a fuelie kind of a more skunky a little bit more and I know this is the sour headband cam Terps are pretty distinct for me on the palate I didn't quite get that with this one what we'll try to get a little bit different temp one thing I've been noticing lately is certain stuff tastes better on certain temps you know I will attempt it a lot and you know as you guys see on the show but I also like to take something a little bit higher everyone somehow and you really want a nice thick full hit I don't like you know how to have it you know a scorcher but a little bit a little bit hotter to have to give you a little bit thicker clouds sometimes it's nice but I've been noticing on some strains I got smoking this I think it was gg4 great bake makes the other day and for some reason whenever I took a hot bath but it tasted really good like usually above a certain attempt to flavor of the dad but for whatever reason with that stuff I took a couple regular dabs and then I took a couple hot ones on accident i really like powers for some reason maybe I'll going all the hotter on this one it's kind of cool I really like their packaging real clean packaging came to the full-size sticker on the inside so it's kind of cool good for branding and whatnot it actually has the test results all right here on the back so it shows you know THC THC a CVD CPGs DBA terpene content this one comes in at 5.4 1% terpenes so that's pretty good you know seventy four point seven seven percent THC zero percent CBD I wouldn't expect to find a whole lot of CBD and sour or a headband in variant that's no surprise there but and then it's got eco-lodge Salmonella mold yeah so it's got all the testing and everything all the ingredients and everything right on the back real nice clean packaging definitely definitely digging that right here in these black sleeves I'll tell you what though this child's sealed the top it's got a picture of some scissors it definitely requires some serious scissors I busted out some kitchen shears that are in pretty good shape real heavy duty ones and it's it was a [ __ ] for me to cut through this thing so definitely good childproof packaging no doubt about that staff probably ready for me over here [Music] yeah I don't think it worked on that one that's a stop now right there you have to go in for another one Incredibles I guess a first time I've actually tried their products first time we've had them on the show I've been hearing about them for a long time though pretty much ever since I moved out here to Colorado they they are really digging in the edible game they do all kinds of different edibles I'm pretty sure they've been doing that a lot longer than they've been you know producing the hash mass quantity but they also make their own clothes loop machine pretty sure it's called the incredibles machine so this is incredible extracts and then they've got Incredibles which is the edibles and then I believe the machine is called Incredibles machine or something like that but uh yeah definitely these guys are you know all over the place doing a lot of different [ __ ] so it's pretty cool yeah the stuff you know this looks real nice smells nice I'm gonna get another dab here to kind of get a real full picture of the flavor on this one definitely already feeling a buzz sight in here like I say they're my first abs of the day so that's usually when I feel the effects the most is right in the morning and this stuff is setting in real real nicely behind the eyes yeah it's just my whole body my whole upper body especially my shoulder just feel kind of loose and a little bit tingly right now so definitely liking the buzz from this stuff I haven't been smoking a lot of just regular shatters lately it's smoking a lot of rosin and a lot of life present mainly but definitely you know pleased with this one decided to take a trip back to shatter Lin and do a video on some chatter because we hadn't done that in a while so I was definitely say I'm happy with this with this pick up the stuff quality final dab here [Music] got way more flavor on mountain you know - that's uh definitely still getting kind of like a creamy thing but there's a little bit of sour undertones in there too you just kind of get that diesel e finished where the first one I kind of just taste it a little bit of sweetness initially and then it went away that one I can still taste it just settle right on the palate so but yeah this shit's are definitely definitely some fire incredibles extracts pick this up grow life Colorado Springs and the other than that thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm Shane [Music]", "9Cf8T-bwhcY": "you guys don't know how you doing man I'm tutoring nice to meet you one that's not you one all right Hey que pasa [Music] tequila business started 22 years ago 22 years ago okay I started my mother's kitchen then this guy helped me a few years after and we built it from the scratch you the man behind it Wow I know the man [Music] this collection is called Mexico through the time to show the cultural richness of Mexico it was a 35 people team working two years to make this happen okay and everything from the what's inside to the outside everything ok so what we did first is choose 15 different eras of Mexico for example this one is focal boo is the name that the sacred book that the Mayans had that book it's written in keachi to change the language of the Mayans so on the case you can read each head this is the letters of the chain this represent a feather snake who was in the first day running around the earth a table it's a solid piece of amber 22 million years old 22 million this piece [Music] [Music] Zomba it's amber let me actually about nothing what about this I like this box tell me about that this bottle is called the 40 Weezer's and then our this one is la noche triste thus at night this is called the margin ballgame this one kind of animation on the bar it's called the celebration and it's a story of all the famous Mexican people attending a party the smell of this boxes remember I don't know if you can smell this it's Elina laughs to call Elina la you had to use the specific word you have to use in specific colors comes from minerals on the ground from the ground give me some prices man what is some list of cars so we lounge this collection seven years ago we saw three bottles individually at $30,000 each a few years ago we decided not to sell individual anymore so the whole collection is four hundred and fifty thousand dollars but all goes to a nonprofit organization to keep helping people who doesn't have opportunities is it good I can taste it no I was way knows in my environment for you from from a favorite bottle it's a blend of two different tasks one cask been rest for 11 years and the other one being rest for 15 years in a sherry cask but that sherry cask was seal made 27 1997 when Europe approved the Mexican appellation of origin tequila how you unlock and how you until we found that cask you found it what was it like a myth did you just hear about it you know exactly where was it [Music] I knew about that Cass and I talked with the owner and said I had to buy that cast car then we share half of half that's why we blend it so this is a blend of tequila's the plan of the best of the best best or this can get sued isn't get sued she let me go smell a bit [Applause] yes is strong but because of tonight we make something special for you because of tonight because of note you are not a manager just so much fun yes so it's the no J this hard that's her phone that's hard yes people you don't have one you don't have one you don't have one you do", "yYmEmulc4QQ": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the half baked extracts live resin batter so here is a better picture hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching and this ethan signing out peace", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "Ze7oTzXDMx4": "yo yo yo what's up everybody this is luke with owls and we got another episode of owls tv and today we are going to talk a little bit about delta eight flour so we've been seeing this everywhere and um and and how it's done you've got a couple of different ways one is you have your solvent-less infusion that's what we do for our pre-rolls right now um with the solving this infusion though it's not really ideal for bud because um it really just coats the outside good for moon rocks but not really for buds and so um i've been beginning to see what i would actually say is some good looking hemp flower that is sprayed with d8 and there is a couple of different ways to do it i mean you can use solvents meaning it could be something like ethanol or acetone or or something that has a uh a very low boiling point where it means it's going to start to evaporate quickly and so i just wanted to get feedback from each and every one of you like what do you think about this stuff because i find that in a lot of states the ones that i'm talking to nobody cares they don't really care is it is it is it sprayed is it this is it this way is it that way they just want the blood now of course with al's that's not something that we're going to be doing uh when it comes to just like let's just knock it out that's not what we want to do here however i did just want to hear from you i mean have any of you tried delta eight flour and if so did you check to see was there solvent a residual solvent test um is this something that is meaningful to you or are you more like yeah i don't really care and i just would love to be able to get delta a flower in my state and so we're beginning to investigate this further uh the benefits i would say of a solvent approach would be that you can really get the buds soaked versus a non-solvent approach would be more on the outside of the bud i'm pretty sure we at owls could come up with a non-solvent disinfusion that would get into the buds themselves i haven't fully looked into that yet but it definitely seems like people want this and so we're beginning to investigate it further and i just wanted to hear from each and every one of you what have you been thinking and i mean look some of the buds i mean my god like you know you want to use the premium you want to use the best of the best i i'd probably use some indoor or light depths or something like that you see some of this schwag that is being uh you know here's some d8 sprayed on it and you can pick it up super cheap it's like keep that to yourself don't want any of that thank you very much and so i just wanted to hear from each and every one of you and also like would you buy it in like um in eights in quarters would you buy it by the ounce and so yeah i just really wanted to hear some feedback from you oh and and and what's it been like what's your experience being like is this is this something that you all want because we want to give you what you want and so i know we've been sort of we want to release these other products first like the tinctures the elixirs the concentrates but i want to start working on on on the flower if it's something that all of you want so just let me know in the comments what do you think about d8 flower are we crazy do you know do you care about the solvents do you check out the reports and let me know what you think thanks for watching you", "KXLWw4F8kHg": "oh yeah you know 210 [ __ ] patrons why why don't we just [ __ ] load up four grams and you know why don't we slip up poor reactor that sounds like a great idea Mateus [ __ ] dumbass what's going on beautiful people beautiful patrons welcome welcome welcome it's time for some more graham [ __ ] off the tour of glass core reactor so as about a hundred and fourteen of you might know already we have crossed 110 mark our 11th goal on patreon and the goal set was that we would bridge a red hot poop soup dab for graham dab off the Toro core reactor and that's what we're doing today guys it's gonna be some serious [ __ ] we have exactly 4 grams in here before we get this started up we're gonna take a peek at some of the diarrhea purse that you're smoking today we got about a half gram of the Beau's future and we got about three and a half four grams of these two terms left so these ones have a nice fish eat peanut butter taste to it basically just makes you want to kill yourself it's absolutely terrible in every single way and then this guy right here actually looks like baby diarrhoea or baby vomit fortunately though this one has a little bit less taste to it which honestly is the best thing that can happen here is that somebody [ __ ] up and then turps don't taste very good we got to get a D average that's gonna support 4 grams we got to get this banger red-hot and we're gonna give you guys some aftermath after the fact I just want to say a personal thank you to each and every one of my hundred 14 patrons you guys all are [ __ ] amazing I truly appreciate you guys especially hanging in there while we're

we got Kate Brad be glass tube I figured this had big enough down and it was a 10-millimeter joint held a 90 seems like we're good on water cap dabber heat load go all we got to do I think the only way we're gonna cap a banger and this big is with the Gus gap glass reticello Kathy gave me this more engagement present let's me and Kate got engaged leave that's gonna be the only cap I'd have that's big enough it's actually too big we could go for a bigger back here that should work just fine I think what we're gonna do guys is heat this as hot as I can get it and then just scrape up everything in these two jars and slam it in I think that's the only way we're gonna get this done otherwise the mangers gonna be cold other shit's gonna go wrong make sure you're done last bit of extra water out there I don't want any messy water coming touching my mouth well in the middle of this insane ass damn let's do it let's heat it up guys let's [ __ ] heat it up hundred fourteen patrons check the link down below if you guys would like to become one of the first hundred twenty it was Artie portable one of the last six hundred twenty and for those of you who don't know what patreon is is basically a place where you get to watch my videos earlier than everybody else they come out three days early you guys can check my first three days later they released for everybody

full can of butane over here just in case we run out I've never actually had to eat up a full core reactor so to be interesting guys he is very very interesting I mean this from the amount of time of having to put the heat up I pick one before but I did not put this much time in I just got it to the point where it's clear we're having to move all the chests is time I'm assuming we're gonna have to come in from the top over here get some of that off the little quartz nipple nub the net the court snip nothing nothing's coming off how do you get that nipple hot enough to remove all the chests we're stuck chill for a while there it goes I highly doubt this whole thing those red hot if it did it'd probably take another five minutes of heat up but this is definitely gonna be a hot [ __ ] down start the [ __ ] the half gram [ __ ] herbs oh man they're viscous they're hard to get out of the jar it's literally like the [ __ ] peanut butter so as much as I can get it's all just running around down there and then this is gonna be the fun one oh [ __ ] my ass this is stupid it's probably about 3 grams anymore we need that last gram down there so I'm having an issue with an all getting stuck to the wall as I'm trying to pull it out there's just too much oh there we go that's it that's it I got that [ __ ] last string right there alright we're gonna have to throw a little bit more heat into this banger but first let's take a look at our massive glob here guys I am like this is [ __ ] huge holy Sh oh my god alright guys there it is or [ __ ] 4 I'm going to say 4 plus maybe right on for actually that doesn't look like or Graham down adds more heat go for it I think I might have to do a full heat up again while balancing this turn Avoyelles over here oh this is gross this is gonna flood this banger big time there is almost more oil than Bangor here I really wish I could shatter this out this will probably be like a - oh [ __ ] it just run as fast now call that good call that good partially because I'm losing the oil and partially because the torch is dying give it about 15 to 20 seconds ish and then we're gonna just drop this [ __ ] guys cheers to 514 patrons love each and every one of you so very much I just hope it doesn't go up in flames I don't want to go too hot because there's so much quartz that's probably the first thing that's gonna happen let's go ahead and give it a try guys for [ __ ] Graham whoo damn for my hundred fourteen patron Cheers [Music] mistake [Music] the combination of those two flavors was like single worst thing I've ever tasted [Music] Pano's that was sober I feel like I got the shivers I feel cold but my whole body's hot I was so [ __ ] gross dab sweat like a [ __ ] oh my god she's such a stupid Neil [ __ ] that thing let's get some air back in me Jesus [ __ ] alright the second I went for the reheat the [ __ ] downstem clogged up and routing that much oil in a banger like that sucks all the heat out so quick so when I went back in there was just nothing oh my god [Music] [Music] I forgot to change the bed Holly set up your turf naps before you take the stupid ABS that way absolute is super jams you can just okay what did I need I mean these sheets I need your pelvic axes and then where you got the blanket so we're 30 percent of the way there that was I I would assume that's what the devil's semen tastes like

[Music]", "CFzTfuNE1HQ": "what up everybody this is star from star Delta 9 how're you doing today are you having a great day I hope so I wanted to come in to you and I want to ask you guys a question do you know the benefits of dabbing Delta 8 THC no it's not a typo I didn't make a mistake Delta 8 th theme it's a different type of cannabinoid that is responsible for medicating us and works just as effectively for medical issues we have been Delta 9 THC cos but most people think of Delta 9 THC when we think about the psychoactive effects of cannabis everybody thinks of Delta 9 so I just wanted to come over and speak to you guys a second about Delta 8 do you know about it have you dabbed it is it available in your area and do you know the benefits of it like I said it Delta 9 THC is not the only cannabinoid that's responsible for any psychoactive effects or medical proprieties that help us in our medical conditions although Delta Aid is not as strong as Delta 9 THC it still has medical benefits and proprieties to it and you may not have heard about it and Delta 8 THC is what it is is it's a double bond Mary I'm a double bond isomer and it's more commonly false underneath the umbrella of Delta 9 THC and so well like I said it might not be as strong Delta 8 is still capable of getting you or an individual like myself medicated and giving me therapeutic benefits at the same time well there's been a lot of primary research that's been going on and most of the primary research that's been going on has to do with Delta 9 THC and more primarily mostly CBD lately so I went back and I was doing some research on this and in 1995 there was some research that they did by a doctor that did that treated 480 patients successfully with cancer and it stopped their nausea and vomiting and put their disease in mission and if not parotid without any side effects are harmful conditions that come along with Big Pharma well in the additional report the National Cancer Institute found that Delta eight combined with THC and a delta nine as well as CBD had the ability to stop similar growth to stop it completely so I wanted to come at you guys and take out a couple dabs of the Delta eight with you and talk to you about it that's what Delta eight looks like unless you live in the West Coast area somewhere you probably are hard-pressed to find it the there are a couple patents that came out one was in 2004 and it was the patent was basically the conversion of CBD to Delta eight to THC and then there was a second patent that came out after that that said Delta eight could be being usable as an anti medic which prevent which is basically preventing nausea and vomiting and they just basically in their patent went over the ingredients so the average layman wouldn't have been able to read it it just went over the ingredients on Delta eight treating non-sampling Cheers [Music] woo-wee tasty the National Cancer Institute defines Delta 8 as an analogue up THC with anti medic anti lytic appetite stimulating analgesic and neuro preventative proprieties to it good well in 2004 there was a study that was done and it was basically done with this dr. Randolf mekin ball and he's the doctor that discovered in Delta 9 THC well in 2004 he actually there was a study that where he had used Delta 8 and treated 480 cancer patients these cancer patients were children between the ages of 3 and 13 and he was stating that it it prevented their anxiety from their treatments and prevented any side effects from Big Pharma medications put their disease in remission and prevented any nausea and vomiting that they had so maybe Delta 8 is the answer to our anxiety to I have anxiety really bad in my gab a 42.3% CBD and the rest THC when I had anxiety and I had anxiety before I dab this and I feel very calm I feel very clear-headed but the National Cancer Institute defines Delta 8 is an analog of THC which means it falls under the umbrella of Delta 9 THC so the federal analog Act makes Delta 8 illegal so gules extract was the first person that was able to come out with an extract that gave us pure Delta 8 in a CBD or THC form and came out gooey and delicious and sticky and yummy so you might be able to find you some over there but I wanted to come in to you and ask you a few questions about this Lucy have you ever dab Delta eight I've never dabbed it before so let's take another dab of it I was trying to find where I had written down who is dr. Randall Emmie CH o UL am he headed the team of these 480 children that had cancer from the ages of 3 to 13 and all of them were successfully treated with Delta 8 Delta 9 CBD combined now I would think if the government found something like Delta eight that they say stopped tumor growth in its tracks put cancer in remission that I would be shouting that [ __ ] from the rooftop and at the very minimum I would be doing some more research on Delta eight very little research is being done on Delta eight currently they did when I went back and looked at they did do a study in 1974 using mice and they were checking to see if the delta ate harmed the immune system well they found out just the opposite that it the cannabinoid Delta ate THC have the ability to stop cancer in its tracks i I think they ought to be shouting that [ __ ] from the rooftop now it's documented you can go back and see after the 2004 study that this doctor Randolph in it took the government a year to admit openly that Delta eight Delta 9 THC combined the CBD had any medical benefits to it whatsoever it took him over a year to admit that come on if you find something like Delta eight and it works for cancer it stops tumors growth in its tracks prevents nausea and vomiting allows children between the ages of three and thirteen to have remission or complete cure of cancer why wouldn't you be shooting this [ __ ] from the rooftop and why are you defining it as an analog under Delta 9 THC so that you make it illegal for us to [ __ ] gay that's my question why now I know ghoul that's trucks you can go over to Google X trucks on Instagram and you can you can hit them up Google extracts makes amazing extracts they are the first person that brought us dealt at eight so they would be very experienced at telling you any more information that you might want from this but you know all the way back in 1974 they were doing studies on mice with this [ __ ] and it was not harming our immune system it was doing just the opposite it was stopping tumors in their tracks putting children and people in remission that had cancer Cheers I'm gonna go in on another damn of this don't get ate you gotta get you some Delta eight now everybody thinks 2009 THC when you think about the psychoactive effects but I feel very good I feel very clear-headed I feel very relaxed I have no anxiety whatsoever you gotta get you some for my questions to this we all know that in the United States that the leading cause of death is accidental overdose how many of those are cannabis related sip zero how many are Oakley related alcohol related other drug related but so if we have a point that there's so much for us medically why is it happening why are we not fighting yeah we are in our own advocate for ourselves our family and other patients we need to fight the fight stay stay stay the course so and steady but hard and mighty because they're not listening to us but they've hidden this [ __ ] from us per long time guys I mean gone I feel amazing I love dabbing medication that works for me I don't dab because on and get loaded IPAB because I need medication to control anxiety or pain and if Delta eight Delta nine CBD does it for me then I'm gonna dab my house on my plant I love my dream [Music]", "GaXu1_tgNng": "\u266a\u266a Yo, yo, yo, what up? It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box. Marijuana, munchies, music,\nand merchandise. $200 worth of it\nevery month for 97 bucks anywhere in California\nand soon in Las Vegas. -How much marijuana? -A lot of marijuana. -Is it good marijuana? -Really good. -That's cool, man. -Thanks. So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours. You got a key\nand I keep it -- [Mumbles] Oh, man. -Look at this, though. This is everything. I appreciate you all man. You'll be able to roll\nyour own joints right here. Oh, a rolling tray man.

find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought up twice that is a twofer and the twofer is uh pbs's frontline documentary series all of them uh they're all amazing they come out with like 10 a year of all different kinds of topics but very specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how heartbreaking it all is uh but it's actually a wonderful documentary and has changed my views on plastics that is front lines pbs's front lines plastic boards something i highly recommend along with the ocean cannabis co live resin straw nana and that guys is gonna do for the cherry on top and the review efficient one today while we're out here at the ocean thank you so much to anybody who's made it this far until we see you for our next review that tractor says stay high more importantly stay healthy later you", "9iMhsjsrt-8": "Julia at our Joliet location in front of our security office we have give or take check out the water room real quick before we head back from the valves we can control everything the flip of a valve press of a button on the computer and I'm irrigating 600 plants all at once so very efficient system takes 30 minutes this is the Delta doors it takes us into the cultivation hall every door that has plants in there you're going to need not only a fob to get into this main door but then you're going to need a key to get into the individual door so double measureless security my main job here at Cresco is to keep the wheels turning we have a two week production schedule that we stay on meaning we're harvesting every two weeks everything does start and then our vegetative space here you can come on in what we do is we take cuttings from this plant we will put put them in a rock wall slab the root from there I'm in about two weeks after that we can uh pot those clones about two weeks you'll have roots coming out of the bottom they'll go from these one inch to the three inch we do do some breeding here at Cresco but 90% of our production is clone cuttings when we give them nutrients or we give them a beneficial bug we have to document everything out there and that gets reported to the Illinois so we are headed to room 231 this is is the youngest room out of all of our flower so these plants have been in here for these white hairs that come off of the plant here those are going to what's going to eventually turn into your buds or your flowers on the plant but these plants go anywhere from 50 to 70 days in this room depending on the strain the plants in this room are about four weeks old you just saw those were two weeks old these guys are four weeks old once these plants come into the flower rooms we're not allowed to spray any pesticides on them so we give them beneficial bugs we give them good bugs they eat the bad bugs this is week six from 131", "2jXagbNPxk8": "So we moved into the members\nlounge. Welcome. -Thank you.\n-Thank you. What we prepared\nfor you here is a selection of essentially\nthe best experience that we have to offer\nfor the palate, so this is the Davidoff\nOro Blanco, obviously\nwhite gold in Spanish. Obviously there's\nno gold in this, and the Don Q 20-year-old\nPuerto Rican rum, so the Davidoff Oro Blanco is the first cigar\nthat was made by master blender\nEladio Diaz. This cigar is grown\non a square mile of land in the Dominican\nRepublic, and it's a place where\nthree different rivers come together to meet, which creates\nthe fertile rich soil which allows this kind\nof product to be made. The tobacco was\nharvested in 2002, and then they were\nonly produced one time. -So it's very exclusive.\n-100% exclusive. This is probably\none of the rarest cigars in the United States\nmarket. Wow. This cigar we sell\nfor $500 a stick. Oh, wow. Look at that.\nIt's almost nothing. These $500 apiece? Yes, sir. 5 bang\nfor that box, $5,000. -$5,000.\n-I mean, that's now because maybe later on,\nit can go for more. Well, of course. I mean,\nif it's that exclusive. And that's for me? Of course. Tobacco, as long as you\nkeep it well-prepared, these cigars will last\nessentially forever. What is the best way\nto keep these? The temperature, I think... Do you have to have a humidor\nto keep these, like...? -Yes, absolutely.\n-Dang. The preservation\nof the humidity and the temperature\nis crucial, so 70 degrees\nand 70% humidity is essentially ideal. If the cigar gets too wet, the oils in the tobacco\ndeteriorate, and you lose\nsome of the flavor, and if it's too dry,\nit'll burn hot, and then it's harsh.\nWe do all the work for you. You don't have to worry\nabout any of that. What's your most expensive\nmembership here? Most expensive is $10,000. -Is that a month or...\n-It's lifetime. -Oh.\n-Okay. Our members get a 10%\ndiscount off everything, in each of our locations, access to the\nmembers-only lounge. -Okay.\n-Our lockers are maintained, spirit tasting,\ncigar tastings. Our customer base, business\nowners are entrepreneurs. There's a lot\nof internal networking that is done through\nour membership. It's just kind of the community\nthat we cultivate. So... Are you in your feelings\nabout trying one? You want to keep it perfect\nin the box, don't you? -If you give me this box now...\n-Oh, God, him and the box. -Right. Exactly.\n-This is all... I was planning on\nsharing this with people. Of course. So... Oh, my God.\nHe's opening it. -Oh, my God. It's over.\n-I know. I'm like, \"Don't.\" -Don't do it, right?\n-Don't. Don't do it. Okay. So in the factories,\nthey will laugh at you if, like here, we pull out a cutter\nto cut the cigar. -They do it with their teeth?\n-Exactly. Yeah.\nIt is a product\nentirely made by hand, so why use\na machine to cut it? Now, of course, I will not bite your cigar,\nI promise you. Yeah, don't bite.\nDon't bite. [ Laughs ] Sometimes in life,\nyou just gotta do it. True. Properly to light the cigar\nrather than cutting it, you light it first\nin indirect heat. You basically start\nto warm up the oils in the outer end\nof the tobacco. They call this toasting. The idea is to draw\nthe smoke into your mouth and taste it without\nbreathing it into your lungs. Are you gonna\ncut it now or no cut? Yeah. Bring the smoke in, and you hold onto it,\na lot like red wine again. You let it roll\naround the mouth, breathe out\nthrough the nose. Much like food, if you\ndon't activate the nose, you don't get\nmost of the flavor. Activate the nose\nto embrace the flavor. Ooh, I like that. You said that way\nbetter than I did. Does this work like the joints,\ntoo? Puff, puff, pass? Weird.\n-Bad form to share cigars. That being said...\n-No puff, puff, pass. ...a big part of enjoying\nthe right cigar is when you feel\nis the right time and the right moment\nwith the right people, so I never, never, ever\nwould push someone to try a cigar\non my behalf. You gonna try, Amara?\nYou gonna try it first? Yeah. Yeah. After you. Go ahead.\nI have lips, thank you, see? So it's a solid out. Yeah, well,\nI'm taking care of you. Go ahead. But it actually feels good. Come on. You're gonna\nget it together. You know what I'm saying?\nLike, you do this. -You just got to do it.\n-Man, maybe you hit it. I got to learn\nbecause these things\nwill get you high, right? I mean,\nit just looks right. It looks like\na beautiful experience. -I mean, it truly, truly is.\n-Do it. I never, ever would push\nsomeone to try a cigar. You know what I'm saying?\nLike, you do this. We'll take care\nof you, I promise. -Come on. Let's do it.\n-Please. Go ahead. You do this. \u266a\u266a Yeah. Okay. I don't know how\nnot to swallow. How to not what? True. I had to stop\nmy throat like. I had to... As you can tell,\nI'm very good at this. Yeah, you're very good\nat this. -I would say so.\n-Let me see. Okay. So... Yeah. Y'all know how to hit\nthat motherfucker. Yours looks way\nbetter than mine. When you have one of these,\nyou be boss. You're a natural. Yes.\nI might get into this. Man, you know how\nto smoke that thing. You're getting high,\ntoo, a little bit. Certainly know\nhow to smoke it. Well, you're shaking\nlike a motherfucker to let you know\nsomething just happened. When you smoke, are you supposed\nto have a drink with it? Does it add to the flavor,\nto the experience? Absolutely. 20 years old,\nwe can drink this, too? What you mean?\nYou're 2 Chainz. You can have anything\nin this table. -You feel good?\n-Yes. Then pour\nsome liquor up. Let me introduce you\nto a gentleman from the company who will walk you through\nthe entire process. Who you got, man?\nWhat's going on, man? How you doing, my friend?\nJohn Meisler. Nice to meet you.\nI'm 2 Chainz. -Nice to meet you, sir.\n-All right. \u266a\u266a I hear you know something about this 20-year-old\ntreasure right here. Serralles is a family\nthat moved to Puerto Rico and started making\nrum about 1865, named their rum\nfor Don Quixote, you know, the search\nfor the new world. You know, you have the\nimmigrants come to Puerto Rico and create a new life\nfor themselves.\nRight. We have what we call\nthe angel's share. That's what's lost\nto evaporation during aging, and in Puerto Rico,\nsince it's always hot, old rums are very rare in the Caribbean,\nquite frankly. So they started\nsearching the warehouse, and then they came\nacross this lost stash that's been sitting back there\nfor years and years. It was mismarked,\nand it was 20 years old. They lose 8% to 10%\na year compounded, so what was once 300 barrels was down to\nabout 50 barrels of rum. They said, \"You know what?\nThis is something special, so let's commemorate\nour family's history.\" Okay, so I have to ask.\nI'm sorry. -Please. Please.\n-But what does this go for? $1,865. You gonna try it, Amara?\nYou gonna try it first? Yeah. Yeah.\nAfter you. Go ahead. I'm taking care of you.\nGo ahead. You know what I'm saying?\nLike, you do this. -May I?\n-Yes, please. It's a very dry,\nexquisite, almost\ncognac-bourbon-esque style. -Awesome. Thank you.\n-Yep. You see the beautiful\ngold and amber hue that comes in the color? That's all from the barrel.\nIt's the real thing. You smell the wood,\nsomething a little different from what you would\nnormally expect. What makes it so special\nand the perfect pairing for this cigar...\n-True. ...those acids\nand tannins coat your mouth. You take a sip,\nand you smoke the cigar. Your mouth is protected\nfrom the heat. The flavors come together.\n-Yeah. This ain't gonna\nhurt me, is it? No, not at all.\nThat's the point. If you smoke and drink\nat the same time... Well,\nit coats your mouth. ...you'll be all\ntypes of messed up. But that's the whole...\nThat's the beauty of this. -All right.\n-You know, and good alcohol shouldn't burn you\nin the mouth. You should feel it\nabout right here. -Okay. Let's see.\n-And here, cheers. Oh, cheers. Cheers. Voil\u00e0.\n-Whoo. Man: Ow. That stuff\nis strong, man. -Well, it...\n-I mean, once it goes in. Well, that's the thing,\nyou know? Once it goes in. That's all I need,\nthis little bit right here. I can't even drink\nall this. -[ Gargling ]\n-There you go. What? \u266a I'm gonna live life \u266a \u266a Without a care\nI don't care, I don't care \u266a Do you feel it in your chest? I do.\nIt's still going there. But it's not hot\nin your mouth.\nNo, it's not hot in my moth. -It's just right here.\n-Why is it moving so slow? [ Voices distorted ]\nWell, come on. Keep doing it. We'll take care of you,\nI promise you. -\u266a I just want to let you go \u266a\n-Is it burning? -Yeah.\n-You have to embrace it. Just shake, you know\nwhat I'm saying? Well, I can do that. You know what I'm saying?\nOoh. The name of this episode is\ncalled M\u00e1s Car\u00edsimo. I'm your host,\nDos Cadenas. And I'm Amara. Yeah, see...\n[ Mumbles ] La Negra. We're still working\non those R's. -Amara.\n-Muy bien. -Muy, muy, muy...\n-Muy bien. ...muy bien.\nYeah, s\u00ed. -Oh, wow.\n-Yeah.", "3Vn49LbQBQg": "good morning my name is Joe Luce Rd I'm the president and CEO of key relief T relief is a leading multi-state operator in the United States we have operations in 11 states with plans to enter at least two more markets in 2019 we are a vertical cannabis company meaning we cultivate manufacture and dispense cannabis we have the largest retail network in the country with 42 stores operational today underneath the key relief banner we are also public in October of 2018 key relief went public on the Canadian stock exchange through a reverse takeover process we raised 400 million dollars from over 100 institutions around the globe and I'm anxious to tell you our story today and how we're gonna deploy that capital to create shareholder value in 2019 and beyond first a bit of background about myself so I've been the CEO for the last three years prior to cannabis my experience was in private equity in M&A in 2010 I was responsible for opening the first vertical medical marijuana business on the East Coast in the state of Maine I was also responsible for opening the first vertical business in Massachusetts in 2015 I joined a company called palliate eck in 2016 as its CEO now key relief with the goal of creating the first true National cannabis brand and I believe are well on our way to doing that before I get into our company in specifics I want us to spend a few minutes talking about the industry in general and our perspective on how things are going and then I'll get into the details about our business so I think we all know this but we've seen unprecedented growth in the cannabis sector but haven't been in the industry for nine years what's amazing to me is the accelerated pace of change we've seen over the last 12 months it's absolutely incredible last year it's estimated that cannabis was an 11 billion dollar regulated space and growing by estimates to twenty three billion in the next four years but more importantly the addressable cannabis market today is 50 billion dollars in growing every single quarter so we are incredibly optimistic about the the Headroom and the market and our ability to continue to grow given the demand for cannabis importantly the public opinion is changing rapidly on cannabis but recent polling suggests that ninety-three percent of Americans now support medical use and greater than sixty percent support adult use the public perception on cannabis is changing rapidly from many different elements primarily from a taxation perspective and also because I think Americans are more and more recognizing that we don't want to be a society that warehouses people for nonviolent drug crimes so we think those trends are positive and what's happening is it's generating positive results at the ballot box and state houses and we think at the federal level in 2019 I have never been more optimistic about the legislative framework that's happening in cannabis both at the federal and state level a groundbreaking event happened in December of 2018 the farm bill which will have dramatic impact on our company and I'll explain that to you in a minute but the farm bill was the first break breakthrough in the wall where cannabis is becoming mainstream CBD a compound from hemp will be the first mainstream cannabis compound that will be sold nationally and will break through that the the decades of MIT propaganda from the pharmaceutical industry and we're very encouraged by that at the federal level we expect that despite the recent shutdown once the legislature get bats back to work we think the split house is going to inert to the industry's benefit in 2019 the Democrats are going to take leadership on this issue in the in the Congress this year you will see standalone pieces of legislation pass out of committees and on the House floor including banking research and we also believe both chambers will take action on this Zach this year we are spending a lot of time and energy in Washington DC bringing these issues to light and lobbying for the interests of the industry and we think that will get significant legislation in 2019 for folks that don't know what the states act is the states Act is a federal recognition that states can make their own Marijuana Policy why that's important for US companies is because it will not only give us access to federal banking but it will dramatically reduce our cost to capital and it will likely allow us to list on US exchanges which is exciting to us as they said the hemp was a the hemp the farm bill was a breakthrough and federal legislature in 2018 by some estimates the CBD market will be twenty two billion dollars in 2020 that it's going to be the hottest trend in consumer products in 2019 you will see every company in the industry rushing into this space luckily we had the foresight to anticipate this and develop a national CBD brand which we launched in November and will be a mainstream product for our company in 2019 so medical cannabis is legal in 33 states in the u.s. Missouri and Utah most recently added to the ranks in ten states we have adult use programs already hemp is now C CBD from hemp is now legalized all this suggests that cannabis will continue to be mainstreamed and that the companies that that are that have the infrastructure today will be the ones that would be the ultimate beneficiaries of these changes and this significant growth that we expect to see in the industry over the next four years importantly at the state level what we believe we're about to see is the acceleration of adult use programs driven by the Massachusetts catalyst so Massachusetts is the first state on the East Coast to implement an adult use program at December of 2018 Massachusetts is a state with 7 million people in 24 million tourists with only 5 stores open the state is already projecting that the markets on a hundred million dollar run rate and we expect Massachusetts to open up dozens of companies in 2019 in this day Massachusetts will generate tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue in 2019 and that will not be ignored by the neighboring states and states all up and down the seaboard and companies that have the infrastructure in those markets today like key relief will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the liberalisation of those programs Maine has already passed an adult use bill we expect meanwhile implement an adult use program in the summer of 2019 in new jersey governor phil murphy campaigned on adult use cannabis we expect the New Jersey Legislature will pass an adult use bill in the first half of 2019 unleashing a state with nine million people to adult use cannabis in New York Governor Cuomo has finally got religion on cannabis so much so that he put it in his budget and by his estimates cannabis can deliver 300 million of tax revenue to the state in New York and the first year alone finally in Connecticut governor Lamont has acknowledged that cannabis for adult use as a foregone conclusion and that he could no longer let the black market control this industry more importantly this will put pressure on many other states on the eastern seaboard and across the country to look more closely at adult use programs we fully expect that in Arizona in Florida you will see adult use ballot initiatives in 2020 the governor governor wolf of Pennsylvania has already publicly stated they need to look at adult use cannabis and we expect many of these other states that convert to adult use programs creating a huge amount of opportunity for existing operators so how to securely play in this space first as I said we are a vertical cannabis company we have 12 cultivation facilities today with 650,000 square feet in operation today which by many accounts makes us the largest operator in the United States we have 10 manufacturing facilities on any given week we extract more than 20 thousand grams of cannabis oil and all of our products are unified under the Cure leaf brand so we are not hoping to be a branded company we are a single branded company when we built this company we set out at the outset to develop one cohesive brand strategy around key relief so our stores are all key relief the vast majority of our products are key relief and we are laser focused on creating a national brand our thesis on cannabis and the value chain is actually quite simple cannabis is a commodity over time the cannabis will continue to be commoditized we've already seen on the west coast enormous pricing pressure on the commodity itself we think that will be true in Canada as well in fact we don't believe the Northern Hemisphere will be leading the cannabis cultivation industry in half a decade we will likely be importing cannabis from Uruguay or the southern hemisphere where we can't possibly compete with those inputs but for now it pays handsomely in the United States to be a vertical operator given the state-by-state infrastructure so for the for the next few years we will be a significant cannabis cultivators but ultimately what we're focused on is becoming the most accessible cannabis company in the US by having the most amount of retail where we can get to the patients and the consumers and have the shelf space but more importantly have a unified brand strategy where the products we sell in our stores are key relief products and not somebody else's so this is where we operate today from a regulated state cannabis perspective we operate in Maine Massachusetts Connecticut New Jersey New York Maryland Florida Oregon Arizona California and Nevada and we will enter Pennsylvania in Ohio in 2019 and I just want to point out a couple highlights from this map so in the state of Florida we are one of 13 vertical operators in the state in 2018 Kiril Eve opened more stores in Florida than anybody else we just started harvesting a 250,000 square foot greenhouse in Central Florida and we will be an industry leader in Florida in 2019 we will open up almost twice as many stores in 2020 up to the 40 store maximum and we will cover this state and create access to cannabis in the Cure relief products in New York we are one of 10 operators we have open all four of our allotted stores and we expect to be the significant beneficiary of the liberalisation of that market and the conversion to adult use in the years come in New Jersey we are one of six operators New Jersey is our most mature market in New Jersey we have an over 40% market share even though we're one of six operators we have the biggest market share in New Jersey because we have the deepest amount of SKUs we have the highest quality and we have the lowest price in the state in Connecticut we are one of four grower processors we are wholesaling now to the existing nine dispensaries and we expect nine more dispensaries to come online in 2019 in the state to enact an adult use program in 2019 as well and finally our home state of Massachusetts we are incredibly optimistic about this state given that we have one of the largest cultivation capacities in the state and we expect to be a beneficiary of the liberalization of that market in 2019 and finally on the west coast we're working our way to the West with MA and I'll talk more about that in a moment but more importantly beyond just the 13 states with which we operate in in 2019 we are creating the first true National cannabis brand so we have a CBD line called cure leaf hemp which was launched in November of 2018 in anticipation of the farm bill we expect that cure leaf hemp will be sold in 47 states in 2019 we will carry the cure leaf brand throughout the country and create the first truly National cannabis brand of the United States on the back of that product this is our brand architecture so on the top left is our medical cannabis products available in 13 states in 2019 we have over 200 SKUs of medical cannabis products available today depending upon state regulations we make everything you can imagine from flower to vaporizer pods to topicals edibles oral formulations any product that we can make that delivers cannabis to an individual that needs our medicine we can do importantly we also developed as they said the cure leaf hemp line so this is a 15 SKU and growing SKU and growing line of products that we will carry into mainstream retailers in 2019 we are designing end caps right now for major retailers and we expect to make announcements about this product very soon and I'm incredibly optimistic about our ability to capitalize and be the first National cannabis brand and finally we do have an adult use brand that's really targeted towards cannabis enthusiasts it's available in five states and will continue to roll that product out which is aimed at really the the most enthusiastic people but that want to use the double use cannabis I believe our company is ideally positioned that capitalize on growth opportunities we have a proven track record of ex success not only in winning licenses but also acquiring and integrating companies under one brand there's no other company that looks like us that operates as many states under one brand as key relief we have one licenses in Maine Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Maryland we have required an integrated companies in Maryland Connecticut Florida Arizona Nevada and California and we have a proven track record of not only acquiring companies at highly a creative prices for our shareholders but also integrating them into a common company with common SOPs and one common brand architecture it takes a lot of execution to do that between 2017 and 2019 we will increase our cultivation and operational capacity fivefold to over a million square feet and production we continue to grow our dispensary footprint at the end of 2017 we had seven stores at the end of 2018 we had 36 stores just this week we have 42 stores open and we will open up at least 68 stores with the licenses we own today in 2019 we have the proven track record of opening stores we open and store in this company almost every week we'll continue to do that through 2019 and stores translates into accessibility and that translates into revenue and finally we'll be distributing our national CBD brand which we believe will be on the shelves of mainstream retailers across the country in 2019 all that translates into revenue growth since 2016 we've grown the top line of this company almost 300% every year and we'll do that again in 2019 on our q3 earnings call we guided the market to four hundred million dollars in revenue I believe that key relief will separate from the pack in 2019 and we will deliver industry-leading returns for our investors and people will recognize that we are the highest quality asset in the industry we have a strong financial position as I said we're growing this business and almost 300 percent in the top light every year we expect to generate a hundred million dollars in cash flow in 2019 based on our current operations today our market cap sits at 2.9 billion dollars which is a dramatic discount to our Canadian peers which we don't think is justified as I said we raised 400 million dollars in our equity race the largest single equity reason us cannabis history we will put 150 million dollars of that into our existing business this year and that leaves 250 million dollars of dry powder plus our stock to go out and do M&A and I believe that we are one of the best companies in the space and the M&A arena but more importantly doing M&A that's a creative do our shareholders everybody that's been a shareholder of key relief along the way has made money and that's what we believe in is deploying capital to get the greatest possible return for our shareholders so we'll be very disciplined and how we deploy capital but we'll put that money to work to create value for our shareholders in 2019 and beyond I believe we have one of the finest management teams in the industry our executive chairman is Boris Jordan Boris Jordan was the primary financier of our business prior to the public offering in October Boris has an incredible track record of success in emerging markets he is the founder of Renaissance Capital one of the leading emerging market investment banks in the world Boris sits on the Council of Foreign Relations he has an incredible capital markets experience and he provides a tremendous amount of leadership to our company as our chairman our chief operating officer is Stuart Wilcox Stuart is a distinguished operational executive and before Stuart touring key relief he was responsible for turning around hostess a well-known iconic US brand and a well-known turnaround story Stuart is the guy that makes the trains run on time we have 650,000 square feet - day of operational space and you need someone like Stuart to make all that happen as you can imagine government relations is a huge piece of our business given the state of play of cannabis and u.s. our head of government relations is Eadie Conklin Eddie Conklin joined curly from the McDonald's Corporation where he ran government relations for the entire McDonald's Corporation for many years it is not only providing leadership to our company in DC and state capitals but also to the industry in 2018 the industry formed the cannabis trade federation it's the business Lobby that is in DC to lobby the states act and legislation that will help us operators and Ed is the chairman of that Federation and providing a tremendous amount of leadership to the industry katrina yan is a head of marketing Katrina has come up through some traditional CPG companies including Kraft Foods and that handsome gentleman in the back there is Chris Mahalo Chris Mahalo is a head of retail Chris came up through the home depot and at one point it ran all of Nikes North American stores he's a seasoned retail experience and really our chief experience officer and making sure that all of our stores provide a high quality highly consultative approach to cannabis where people can come in and learn about cannabis and a non intimidating setting and get the products they need I think it's important to say that key release care leaf is a wellness business we are about creating cannabis accessibility promote about creating education and giving people a format where they can learn about cannabis and not be intimidated and that's where we think the markets going and then we're happy about Chris on board to help us in that initiative finally this is a little bit of just macro thesis in our view of the of the you know the cannabis investing landscape I think this chart is actually interesting so if you look at the estimated market size of the Canadian market right now and then you look at the aggregate market cap of the leaders in Canada then you look at the average the estimated market size of the US opportunity and their aggregate market cap of the US operators I think you could pause it that maybe that charts backwards we believe that there will be a sector rotation in 2019 as US companies post significant financial returns and distinguish themselves from their Canadian peers I believe you will see a sector rotation I believe that all US cannabis companies almost are over undervalued and prove significant investment opportunities for our investors why do I believe that one because the u.s. is the largest cannabis market in the world full-stop cannabis is the fastest growing consumer segments in the US and has continued to be mainstream every single quarter there are strong barriers to entry the state by state regulations allow us to build moats honor on our licenses and our business there will be rapid consolidation led by us operators us operators are the best position that roll up this fragmented market giving their presence in the existing space and the states Act will provide a significant value creation for our investors when that passes if and when that passes and finally I think it's important to understand that in the United States we are vertical so we don't not only do we control what we grow on what we make but we control our distribution points and therefore we control how much we charge for our products unlike Canada that has to sell their products to a government so we believe that investors with a long term thesis should get in the US cannabis because it represents a significant opportunity for value creation so I'm in summary just a couple of key takeaways we are the first multi-state operator to create a true national brand we have the largest footprint of branded retail stores in the country we are vertically integrated with industry-leading production facilities we are well capitalized and we have an experienced management team to make this all happen thank you all for your attention I have a few minutes for questions listen hey Matt so the question is does the cure leaf brand affect our ability to wholesale so in fact in some markets I mean we're primarily a retail business we are very focused on being vertical and making sure that our products go through our stores because that's where you enjoy the highest margin but in fact in some markets we do wholesale so for example cure leaf is available for wholesale in the state of Maryland and you can buy it and more than half the dispensaries in the state so we do wholesale it on a limited basis but we're really focused on creating the biggest retail footprint and writing the products into our stores thank you for that question I'm glad you asked that sokurah leaf owns 98 percent of its assets today we have almost no minority partners at this point that is all behind us that everything you see here is what we own so I'm glad you asked that this is not a portfolio this isn't a collection of assets with minority partners this is one integrated company that's owned 98% bikie relief yeah I'm happy to do that so we announced in the fall that we have the ability to do a 50 million dollar share buyback it's no secret that the market said we're incredibly volatile in q4 I think it was the you know by some accounts the worst equity markets in a decade so basically we made that announcement to show shareholders that we stand we're standing in and we believe in the value of our business we're gonna deploy capital where we get the best possible return and that means if the market falls off and our share price is low enough we'll buy back our own shares because we're well capitalized we can generate a one hundred million dollars of free cash flow this year on our own business and so we can deploy that capital to wherever we get the best return for our dollar including buying back shares if we have to well that's an interesting question so you're not really allowed to be organic given the federal standards you can't say you're certified organic but yes in many instances do we grow cannabis does the some of the strictest standards in the country including Massachusetts in Nevada and soon-to-be California so we grow everything without pesticides if we use pesticides we use 25 B pesticides which are organic and all of our products are exit tested meaning that they have to meet the standards of that state including their mold free microbial free no heavy metals and so we believe we're providing some of the safest products in the industry and frankly that's why we're so optimistic about the mainstreaming of Canada because I think consumers are more and more recognizing that there are particularly in the black market there are unscrupulous growers and you don't know what you're getting in that product and so we're proud to say that our products are exit tested highly reliable and safe for our consumers it's time for one more question all right thank you all for your time [Applause] [Music]", "cY3Q-DIh4VY": "we had another dank nug here which is really actually some turns into an interesting question i'ma throw throw a guru here this is over again on duggars calm and this is fresh frozen and dry ice versus bubble by mr. gros bot do you picture a dance when you hear mr. robot I do her song I do from the 80s you know robot I sure can there's one up jeez thanks for playing my fault prohibition report my question today involves home extraction and whether or not to freeze-dry part of my harvest of ethos traits citral glue gorilla glue and form cut cookies was all sound very hot beautiful beautiful I've actually enjoyed junior token does the form cut cookies and it's freaking delicious man I believe I have some of his extracts still so uses to pour cocoa three gallon pots biobus micro Blythe hydro and some cutting edge solutions additives kind of a hybrid organic synthetic approach depending on the plants need in stage I do use co2 this run since I started using the fluence bioengineering spider X plus a--'s I where's the microbes though man I trying to bust balls but he got cocoa okay you got some bio biz in there Mike what is my co the microbe life microbe life Hydra don't know if that's that one product that's microbe right but right okay cool really try it I'm telling you it will help that I'm not trying to be a Salesman but and a bunch of kelp in there and then just uh just amount of bacillus and molasses there you go there's my commercial alright we've gone because you got nitro dishes this traditionally I'd take some good small buds and trim and make dry ice keith sifting through bubble bags product is solid for hash bucks and loose topping bulbs but looking or in lieu stopping but looking for a pure turkey turkey product to be able to extract further from for a wax or shatter after listening to guru speak about frozen fresh flour I'm wondering the process how long to freeze at what temp etc what do you got girl oh I'm out man okay so he kind of confuses a couple things here freeze drying something on let me just give him some COO these are some [ __ ] baby's arms these are beautiful boy look a shout out we want to turn these awesome flowers into the best extract you could possibly turn and solvent list since I'm assuming that's kind of what he's going after it was done by a mr. grow back when you're freezing cannabis nothing there's some problems you can run into it's freezing candidates if you freeze it slowly ice crystals are able to form inside the cells of the plant and they bust open bite and that's gonna that's completely degrade the quality of your stuff I would really recommend to you to not do the dry ice I mean you can get a lot of yield from that but it's not usually the highest quality and if what you're after is some chirpy quality water hash is what I would be going for just trying to make a really really high quality water hash okay what are some preparations for that what are we doing some water has we're just using our screens we use one first off we use it I mean it's done with screens and there's tons of tutorials out there on how to do it really really well and actually someone do gross comics or a link or something into the show notes what about preparing the wind when you're trying to like flash freeze like would professionally lot lot professionally extracted live resins and rosin x' they have the ability to coat to cryogenically freeze stuff and cryogenically means that they're not letting it crystallize to where the cell walls are gonna burst what does cryogenic mean man io means what frozen mmm-hmm and what's genic mean genic means that it's of what pertaining to suitability for reproduction by a medium but I'm not really trying to get off track but just thank you yeah cryogenically freezing stuff is really hard to do at home to be able to do I mean you can do it but I'm not even gonna describe it's kind of dangerous the way you would set up to do it I used to be in time called me a [ __ ] but like how long on average a time right when I remember when I made bubble hash me it's not horrible there [ __ ] no the best recommendation with bubble hash is to not freeze it at all just put it in your refrigerator turned as low as you can get it to go and stuff not freeze almost like you wouldn't like a vegetable crisper drawer just because that's gonna get everything as cold as possible that it can be without actually crystallizing and you make your bubble hash that way and yeah I would say make make really good water hash and then what he asks what do you want to do next should I press it or should I use the source turbo extract I say we have two different products after that right if if you fresh fries or fresh refrigerate your plants and then make ice hash out of it I would really recommend to press it into rosin because you will have achieved alive or asin which is I mean some of the most expensive concentrates they have at the dispensary and the most sought-after and in my opinion the best concentrates out there right now and then the difference if I want to use the source turbo is you know if I was gonna use a source turbo then I would just shake it take dry ice and just shake it and get a bunch of volume out of it because the source turbo could do a decent amount of volume at a time yeah I think that's a decent strategy if you've got that machine sitting around because I mean if I take the time to make the hash that's what I'm yeah I really want to know what's gonna create you know the best at that point for me I'm probably just gonna enjoy it why not just stop there and enjoy the hash you know if you make a really high-quality fresh frozen water hash it is completely dabble and some of the like best extracts I see coming out of 7/10 labs they're selling water hash and it goes for $70 I made great water hash man quality and quality out and you can't shake it too much you can't agitate it too much my buddy shout out and Big Ups to motorcycle Mike who used to make it with a wooden spoon I think using like a drill with you know a big paddle on the paddle bit on the end of it he'd be using a wooden spoon but hey [ __ ] was full-on dabble man or my [ __ ] was there's a lot of it", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching

Hey Seenu! Where are you? What?\n- Did you see Seenu? No. Didn't see him since morning? Bhavani batch is searching for Seenu. If you see him, tell him to escape. Why would he be here?\n- Where will be he be then? But I'll remember you. Take it. He'll not answer for that name.\n- How should I call him then? I'll call him. He wants to know, what's the matter? Bhavani batch is searching\nfor Seenu, tell him to escape. It seems Bhavani batch is\ncoming for you, let's escape. Don mustn't escape.\nGet up, let's go. Get the bat. Bhavani, leave my ear. How many times I've told you\nnot to call me by my name? Bhavani? I sent you to school to study, are you cutting classes to watch film? Bhavani! Don't beat a Don! Go to the class room. Take my bag.\n- Teacher, they cut class to watch film, can't you be strict and punish them? He? He no more fears us. Did you go to watch 'Don' again?\n- 31st time. He'll not reform till he gets\nout of this 'Don' fever. Do you know what had\nhappened in class recently? I'll answer only if he calls\nme as Don Seenu. Are you here only? My son got ruined for\nbeing his friend. Do you know what did\nthey do last night? Did you bring the goods?\n- I've brought, Don. Yesterday a thunder struck my home. After that it rained in my house.\n- Code is correct. Take the cash. Open it boy! Cheating Don! It's empty. How dare you cheat Don Seenu! Don Seenu killed Giri! What happened?\nWhere's my son Giri? Just now I killed your son,\nhis body is lying there, go. Father! I'm dead! Ever since then, my son says...\n- Yes, I'm dead.- That's it! Giri, I'm Don Seenu saying this, you're not dead,\nI missed the target. Then, I'm still alive.\n- Yes. Father, I'm still alive. Vasu, I'm alive! Thank God! I'm saved. Teacher, my son will not attend\nschool from tomorrow. 1Till Seenu is here...\n- Hey Suri Babu! Not Seenu, Don Seenu! Why are you beating him? Just a kid! Can't you look after\nhim like own mother? You shut up. My daughter is also getting\nspoilt under his influence. Admit him in hostel,\nit'll be like jail to him. Bhavani, I'll not go to hostel. You please tell her, Sathyanarayana. I warned you not to call by name. Don't beat me, Bhavani. What's that? Don! Why do you want such silly epithets? Don't beat, he'll behave\nproperly from tomorrow. No need. Either he must be here\nor I must be here. Decide! Come dear. Did you see father?\nHow that devil has beaten him? Have food?\n- No sister. Today, you'll feed me. Anyway I've to eat wormy food\nin that jail from tomorrow. You call everyone by their names,\nwhy do you use relationships for us? Don't know why uncle,\nI feel like calling like that. Isn't it? Then have some food\nfrom sister's hand. We'll not be here to feed you\nfrom tomorrow. Uncle! It's not a sin to kill you also. Either he must be here\nor I must be here. Don Seenu ran away from home! His name is Madhapur Machiraju, land dealings, settlements,\nillegal activities, he's a Don who runs\nkangaroo courts. Greetings sir. Tell me.\n- That is... He was working for a man in Dubai, he cheated him and\nescaped from there, he wants our shelter. How much did you steal?\n- 40! Who did you cheat?\n- Mukesh Duggal! Do you know who Duggal is? He's a business magnet based in Dubai\nwho controls 40 countries with a remote. Should we protect a man who has\ncheated him? Impossible. Tell him to leave. If you don't protect me,\nNarayanguda Narsing will kill me. If you want take 50%, sir!\n- What did you say? Before that? The only enemy Machiraju has\nin this world is Narsing. Narsing has slight upper hand\nover Machiraju in the city. His only wish is to upstage him. He'll compete with Narsing\nin any matter. He follows from the God he prays\nto the paste he uses. When he knew Narsing\nreads Eenadu paper, though he never reads newspaper,\nhe made it a habit to read Eenadu paper. When he came to know he has Benz,\nMachiraju too bought a Benz. Since Narsing is involved\nin this dealing. This deal is okay to me. I'll never let go any chance\nto win over Narsing. How risky it may be! Let's shift him to our\nfarm house in Bidar. Not by road, book a chopper. Let me see what the hell\ncan Narsing do. Daddy is tensed. What he took from us is not money,\nourhonou\ufb02 We want his dead body in 24 hours. I've promised Duggal sir\nto get his dead body. You don't worry. Brother! Machiraju's phone\n- Switch on the speaker. Hey Narsing, you promised Duggal to\nkill the man who stole money from him. I've promised him to protect him. First time in life,\nI'm going to win over you. Today I'll make you taste defeat. He has gone so far that\nyou can't catch him. You mean we missed him!\nWhat am I to tell my dad? You promised to give his body,\nwhat will you do now? If I enter a deal, it's like standing\nagainst the Tsunami. Just watch up! There's your gift! Isn't he the man you want? Haven't you yet recovered\nfrom the shock, Narsing? Am I a school kid to get shocked? If you see what I've for you,\nyou'll freeze like a statue. Me? Why?\n- Just turn left and see. You paid rental for the chopper,\nI paid the pilot, don't try to act smart with me. Greetings Duggal sir.\nJob is done. In a couple of days,\nI'll recover the 40 crores also. Would I take money from you, sir? You're fixing your son's marriage\nwith my sister, that's the biggest gift. Why are you dejected\nas if losing to him is new? How does he know every plan\nwe make here before hand? I suspect there's a mole here.\n- I suspect it's you! Shut up!\n- What... With such fools around,\nI'm not able to win over him. We need a sharp man\nto put a check to him. Pick up the phone, don't sleep! Oh my God! ls it?\n- Oh God!- Really? Why did you beat me sir? Seenu balance Rs.40. Bloody fool! What did I tell you while\nboarding bus last night? Didn't I tell my name is\nDon Seenu or not? You wrote Seenu, balance Rs.40,\nand irritated me. I'll cut your leg.\nDirty face! Where's my bag? I wrote it in a hurry,\nwill you beat me for that? Are you feeling for it?\n- Won't I? I'm hurt, if Don gets hurt,\nit'll be like this only. Remember my words and\nkeep the change. Still hasn't changed a bit.\nHe has become crazier. What shall we do now?\n- Let's act as if we don't know him. Thunder stuck my home.\n- It rained after that. Who do you want sir? Same foolish faces. Do you need this silly acting, Rama Rao? Are you fine, Seenu? Why did you suddenly remember us? Don will never forget his friends and foes. Come on, guys. Why did you come to the city, Don Seenu? I must become a Don urgently. If not now, I can never become in life. Moreover they say it's\ngood season for Dons. Haven't you yet given up\nthat childhood madness? Where were you till now? I appreciate; you've come to the point. I reached Palasa running away from home, I started working as gate keeper\nwith a theatre there, I became Don of Palasa by\nbeating up black marketers there. From village level to Mandal level, I grew up from Mandal level\nto District level, and became Don to the entire district. People wish to become doctor\nor actor, why did you choose Don? You're still the same foolish boy. Do you know the advantages\nof becoming a Don? Mandakini, Monica Bedi...\n- International level. Lots of girls! My name is Seenu! It's shattering! Surname is Don! Knock-out punch! He looks like a total mad man... If we believe him,\nthere will be a Don in every home... Catching Don is not just difficult,\nit's impossible. By the age five I was a fan\nof Amitabh Bachchan... By the time I reached high school,\nI was a Don in my place... I'm not less to any God... I'm coming out in near\nfuture with S-Gang... If I come, it's knock-out... It's fun and frolic... Gangs and gangs will bite dust... I'll be the only one to get saluted... D for Don means star...super star... No legendary hero has\nthis enormous power... Where ever there's a bomb blast...\nfingers are pointed at us... If there's no news,\nthey'll carry news about Dons... A ravishing beauty for a wink... New car every time I step out... Just a phone call can\nrake in the moolah... It's thrills galore if I seek anything... If I've guts, I'll get the Don's chair... I'm tailor made for that chair... Hey mad men! Recognise me! Where did I come from? Who am I? We can play with the globe\nif I become a Don... I can become most wanted man\nif my position raises every day... Can brandish a revolver\nif I face any danger... If in mood, can have\na blast with girl friends... Can irritate police department,\nmake them take headache tablets... Can become friends of film stars... Can make cricket heroes to play... Whatever is done, it's done\nwithout spending a penny... Can threaten and get billions\nof protection money... What would you like to have? You?\n- I want whisky. Seenu you?\n- I want the city's top Don. Forget about it and\nhave a drink happily. First decide that and then drink.\n- What's this twist? Narayanguda Narsing and\nMadhapur Machiraju are leading Dons here. Order drinks now. I must join any one these two gangs. Why would they take you? Isn't it? That's why we've\ncome to a pub. You all know that Don Seenu is here, but this city must know it, right? What will you do now? What do you want sir?\n- I need a man as punch bag. Show me a man here if I beat him,\nit must create big trouble. Look, there's going to be\ntrouble here in minutes, may escape without paying\nin that commotion, so, recover everything along\nwith your tips, right? If you listen to him, you'll go mad.\nGet four beers.- Okay sir. Call all TV channels immediately. Why would they be here?\nAre you a celebrity or legend? To come with cameras. The man who will get beaten up\nhere will be either one of it, if I beat him, it'll be nuisance,\ntomorrow it'll be news. Cal!- What?\n- Phones! ls it NTV?\n- Yes. ls it I News Venkat Rao? ls it Zee TV Tammineni Srinivasa Rao? How will it be if I beat him.\n- He's Commissioner's son, sir. He's not of my range.\n- Will you beat him? ls channel people are coming? It seems they are on the way. I must select a victim now\nand beat him black and blue! How dare!\nYou... You offered cake, it's good.\nWon't you take my birthday gift? I don't know whose son he is.\n- I know. Bloody bastard! I'll not beat some foolish son,\nI'll beat this bastard. No...no... Get up...your head has nasty cut.\nGet it sutured, go to hospital. Hey boy! Got me? Who are you?\n- Name is Seenu, surname is Don, I'm a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan. Are these details for you to get kicked? Alcohol content in Beer is 5%, 42% is whisky,\n50% in Rum, 70% in Vodka, Don Seenu's power punch is 100%. If I punch, it's knock-out,\nno chance of recovery. Greetings Duggal sir.\n- What had really happened? Some one called Don Seenu\nthrashed your son, my men are after him.\nYour son will identify him. I'll handover him to you\nin near future. First send my son here\nin a special flight. I want Don Seenu's dead body\nin 24 hours. Okay done, Duggal sir. Bye. Mistake, Don Seenu committed\na grave mistake by beating my son. It has come to light that Don Seenu\nis responsible for the pub brawl. The man who got beaten up\nis Praveen Duggal, police circles say he's son of\nfamous industrialist Mukesh Duggal. Mukesh Duggal's son? So, I've beaten up the right guy. ls Don Seenu right or wrong\nin beating up Praveen? If your opinion is right type yes,\nor no if it's wrong, and send SMS to 50505. See, how people are\ndiscussing about me. God send few people to do good\nthings and you for doing dirty things. City knows about you, would the news\nhave reached the main people? You go and tell them.\n- No need, I've already informed them. I gave them my address too.\n- Who did you tell? Who is the most powerful man in city?\n- Narsing! That's why I've called and\ninformed Machiraju. It's confusing. Narsing is already powerful,\nhe may not need me. That's why I called Machiraju,\nthey would be here any moment. Who is Seenu here? Who is Seenu here? Why did he slap me now, brother? Are you Don Seenu?\n- I like your attitude, it's me. Brother wants you there.\n- What about these guys? Why should we accompany you?\n- You were with me from beginning. You too come with him. If I get a boy friend like Don Seenu,\nI'll consider myself to be lucky. How come he's so popular? Come in Seenu.\n- Very nice home! Get used to it, this will be\nour working place. Why did you beat Duggal's son? I'll answer only to Machiraju,\nnot to his cronies. Who is he? I'm Machiraju! I expected Machiraju will be tall\nlike rebel star Krishnam Raju. You're so small yet terrorising the city. That's okay, why did you beat him? For publicity! We've seen people beating\nfor money or revenge, what's this for publicity? Revenge is emotion,\ntaking money is profession. Yours?\n- I must become a Don. Will you beat anyone to become a Don? Any one! If necessary, you too. Down your guns. You beat him, that's okay,\nwhy did you call me on phone? Now, you've come to the point. I've made discreet inquiries about\nyou and Narsing after coming here, outside talk is Narsing is\npowerful than you, I guessed you may need\na man like me, that's why I called you on phone. Would my boss take a fool\nlike you into his gang? When an idiot like you is here,\nwhy not me? No, I can cut you with this.\n- You're overacting. Stop... Your planning, guessing,\nand strategy is good. But you've made a big mistake.\n- What is it? I've more advantages in killing you\nthan in taking you in my gang. I'll explain you how. Narsing is going overboard\nbecause of Duggal's support. I'll get closer to Duggal\nby killing you. How can I miss this chance?\nHey, call DuggaI!- Okay. Greetings Duggal sir.\nI'm Machiraju here. Why did you call me?\n- To correct my mistake, Duggal. Narsing is your trouble shooter here, you must also know my power, right? that's why I've caught Don Seenu,\nwho beat your son. Kill him! Pump bullets into him.\nKill that bastard! I'll pay whatever is your price. ls he dead? ls he dead?\n- He's dead! Good show Machiraju!\nFrom today, you're also my man. Ask me whatever you want. Your word is enough Duggal sir,\nI don't want money, just think that I'm also\nyour man from now. His death is my gift to you. Bloody mole! Remove the trash. What's this twist? He was Narsing's mole here,\nso I removed him. I've become friend of Duggal\nby killing Don Seenu. Now, I'll bury Narsing once\nfor all using you. I mean I'm a member\nof your gang, right?- Yes. From now, you're not Don Seenu\nfor few days, just Seenu. I'll not accept. I don't mind if you don't take\nme in your gang. It's impossible to change my name. You want position or name?\n- I want both. Both...you've sacrifice name\nfor few days to get position. You've to sacrifice something\nto gain something. Just few days only, let's adjust.\n- Okay. Then enjoy.\nAsk whatever you want. I want your glasses.\n- Why? It has 'D' on it, it means Don, right? I want that pipe too. There's no 'D on it.\n- I'll write on it. Get going, don't watch like fools, go. He looks like a scheming man,\nwhy are you taking him into our gang? If you all work for money,\nhe works for ambition. He breathes ambition.\nLook...look there! ls it good to get beaten by that kid? We are half finished when he\ngot Don Seenu instead of us. He killed him who should've\nbeen killed by us. We are finished totally.\n- Shut up.- Brother! He overtook me and has\nbecome confidante of Duggal. He made us all Jack asses. If we've to regain the\nconfidence of Duggal, you find out how could\nMachiraju get so smart. Your passport and ticket.\nYou're going to Germany tomorrow. Germany? You're great boss!\nFirst job, that too international! What should I do there? Smuggling? Kidnapping?\nOr kill someone? I'm ready for anything, boss.\n- Not any of that.- Then? You must love.\n- Love? What's this twist?- Yes. Narsing's sister is studying in Germany,\nshe's his life, he loves his sister more\nthan his life, now you must love her, and make her go crazy on you, and Narsing must go mad over this. How can a Don love?\nI'll not do it. You said you'll do anything\nto become a Don. Can't you love for it? One who has all qualities\nwill become Don. There's no history ever\nof a Don falling in love. Why not? Dawood loved Mandakini,\nAbu Salem loves Monica Bedi, My heart is crazy on my lover... Why does he always sees up? Then okay.\nBut I need another ticket. Why?\n- Don never goes alone. He needs company. Look after that, Bobby knows\nthe complete details of the girl. He'll come with you and show her. Come. Did he find this man to\nlove Narsing's sister? Didn't you see girls swooning\nover him on TV? I got this idea then. My stroke will leave Narsing mad. Come. Frowning face! Why this trouble with us now? He'll show her to us, come.\n- Girl? Yes, we are not going on holiday,\non an operation. Operation...? Oh my God!\nNow, I've understood. Are you taking me also to\naccompany you to death? That's what friends are for. This is the college where\nNarsing's sister studies. If college is like that,\nhow would she be like? Did he establish this college? I don't know.\n- What do you know? Don't look so irritated.\nKeep smiling in between. No please. Look there, that's Narsing's sister! Girl with white bag?\n- Yes. I expected an average girl\nfor Narsing's sister, she's super figure! There are many beautiful girls here,\nlet's take a couple of them to India. Did you see her?\n- We saw. We saw her and the\ncompetition she has. Not ordinary following. Flattering her isn't as easy as\ngaining brother's confidence. I don't like winning without\nany competition. You need big money to\nflatter Hyderabad girls, you need meg bucks to flatter this girl. What is this? You can spend as much as you like. He's very good man. if you fail, brother said he'll\ntake back double from you. What do we have to recover?\nNothing. You've life, right? How could you be so negative? I'm like this from childhood. I feel like thrashing you.\nGo back India immediately. Bloody dirty frowning face! Go away.\n- I'll go... But before I leave, remember one thing.\n- What's it? The girl is leaving to India in another\n15 days after completing studies. You've just 15 days only.\nBe careful. We know that, get out. Who is this dirty rotten face? Who is that?\n- It's you, Rama Rao. Names and get ups change from today. I'll swipe this and chase her. You're the first Indian to\nget 95% in psychology. You studied books,\nI studied humans. That's all It's impossible to fool you. Never expected I'll such fine dresses.\n- Change your language. They'll give such a large one.\n- What? The girls are here only. Are they seeing us or not? No. What are you waiting for?\nStart the show. ls this you final destination? The girl says she'll die\nif you don't accept her love. I'll never accept. Just say I love you,\nit'll save her life. How can I say I love you\nwithout loving her? Then, why not start loving her now? It's not lunch to do at any time,\nit's love. You mean afternoon food. Did you see? First time I'm seeing\na man rejecting a girl's love. He's just trying to show off before us. Foolish girls like you\nbelieve it and fall for him. Did you see now? Poor girl, please love her. What poor girl?\nWhy should I love her? If I start loving, half of the\nGermany will be after me. How many girls can I love?\nToday, it's Andrea, tomorrow it could be this girl,\nday after that it could be she, after that all these could join,\nI'm alone here! How can I love so many?\nSettle her...- No... 1200 Euros are gone.\nHow much it's worth? Did the trick work? How? I've ideas and sketches, and a camera,\nand a gold card to swipe. The girl has fallen!\nCome. ls it? We're coming. Already I've told about us to my father. My father too has agreed. I must agree not your father. Poor boy, please love him. Should I love feeling pity? If I start loving then, half of\nthe Germany will be after me. I've heard it before. That Indian boy too said the same\ndialogue yesterday in the cafe. He's your male version. If he has met anyone like me,\nhe'd be hanging dazed upside down. You set up the lighting,\nI'll start after that. Then, make him fall for you.\n- Who?- That man! Are you throwing a challenge?\nI've already thrown it. Shattering! Look, unnecessary things\nare coming into the frame. Where?\n- Not here, look there. Why are you walking in the middle?\nCan't you walk little that side? You don't know Telugu, right? I told you he's very tough. Speak in Telugu.\n- Telugu? Tehlgu people!\n- Telugu? I thought you were Germans\nseeing your figures. We are here to shoot for\na magazine cover page. We want a beautiful and\ntraditional girl. Will you suggest\nif you know anyone? No constraint in money,\nwe'll swipe and pay. I mean card. Isn't my friend beautiful? Beauty must make you\nsee again and again, it mustn't make you turn\nfeeling I've seen it. We want Indian traditional beauty.\nNot a pole dancer. Ram, handle her.\n- Where's her handle? Where were we? I think your friend is hurt.\n- Won't she? I'm also hurt. I can understand if she's hurt,\nyou're so beautiful, why are you hurt? Shall we use her for the cover page? If she's on cover page,\nthey've to shut down the magazine. Yes, if you're cover page,\nwould anyone dare open the magazine? He'll tear the cover and start dreaming. You're praising me too much.\n- That's my weakness. I can't stop myself from\nappreciating beauty. Your friend is waving from there. Excuse me, tomorrow morning at 10 am... I can't understand the route you're going. The route I'm going is\nknown as fingering. She'll flutter with my shaking her up. What?\n- The girl! Am I not traditional?\n- No. Am I not beautiful?\n- No. Why did he say like that?\n- He's different, you know it. You'll look more beautiful\nin traditional dress. What do you mean by it? Should I wear traditional\ndress to impress him? Not now, tomorrow. Bloody bet, let it go to hell. You've picked up fight unnecessarily. She'll not come. He has warned to take our lives\nand you're sitting here coolly. Big B said be positive.\nShe will come. She's ready to undress\nat the drop of a penny. That's culture here. You said she'll come,\nhow can you be so sure? In caroms, to get the red coin,\nyou need to pocket a black or white coin. I've already fingered the white,\nshe'll bring the red coin herself. I can't understand your fingering idea. But we had to swipe the card\nten times a day. If anything goes wrong,\nwe are dead meat. She'll not come. Hey you fool!\nLook there! You're no ordinary man.\nShe's coming with a catwalk. Tell them.\nTell them to come. There's no life, I need soul! No souls here. All are gone. Send her, she seems to be better.\nSend her. Cover page is devastating!\nOkay her. Light is also shattering. She's my friend.\n- ls it? She's the traditional beauty I wanted.\nYesterday that pole dancer... That was also me!\n- I'll not believe it. Yes, it's her. I'll also not believe it. It's her I say. Can a sari change the\noutlook so much? I'll tell you... He gave me just 50 Euros. Don't be stingy, give her 100.\n- Come, I'll pay you. Why are you paying her? I pay the rejects something\nto keep up their spirits. To have drinks and forget the pain. You've been selected\nas cover page model. If you sign the agreement,\nwe can start working. You sign here, he'll sign there. I didn't come here in a sari to\nsign agreement or to impress you, I just wanted to prove\nwhat I'm and I've done it. I knew you'll not sign the agreement.\nDidn't I tell you? Yes, you told me a lot,\nI can't remember everything. How could you know it?\n- Experience! She's afraid of falling in love\nwith me while working. Me? With you? Everyone say that on day one. second day say friendship, third day say close friend, fourth day say boy friend, I've seen many like that. In a week they become weak\nand fall head over heals in love. Head over heals? Fall in love?\nWith you? Then why don't you sign it?\n- Take it. Sign down there. Our contract is for a week. Read condition number 10 that you\nmustn't say I love you to me and sign. No need.\nI know myself very well. You'll also understand that in a week. The girl who took money just now\nlost control and fell in love with me. Music is playing! Hey girl, don't come after me... Love is taboo to me... Love is like gas stove in the heart... Let me be happy alone... Love me...love me...\nkeep me in your heart and love me... Come into my life and\nfill it with light... I get innumerable phone calls\nfrom early morning... SMS's would be running into millions... Men are so crazy about me... Why are you acting so high? May be useless men without\nany work come after you... May be they are spoilt brats\nwith big daddies... That's not real love... You call is as arrogance... O God! Open the love channel\nin his heart... O God! I beg you... Love is not scent but stink... It'll be fine in you look into\nmy eyes and love me... If you taste love once,\nyou'll feel like falling in love... I'm great...don't delay it further... If I look into your eyes,\nI may get conjunctivitis... If I come after you,\nit may ruin my career... Why should I take the risk? Love is not my cup of tea... Though I'm cajoling,\nwhy don't you try understand it? I haven't seen anyone\nmore proud than you... Are you a girl or ghost? Why are you after like a\nsticky chewing gum? Why have I become like this? I must be very careful with him. How did it happen?\n- We don't know. Today morning we got a phone call. I think the he was murdered\n5 days earlier. He was shot at point blank range. What are you thinking, brother? If he was killed 5 days ago, he had called me from\nMachiraju's place the same day, so, he know he's our man, I had a doubt if the man killed\nwas Don Seenu or our man. Inquire about Don Seenu. I want his family, friends details\nand his horoscope. I told you to control your feelings. Tour hasn't started and\nyou've started it already. Don't let your imaginations go wild. Today is my birthday.\nI just called to invite to the party. The party is in the restaurant. Friendship, right? Your birthday is on November 6, right? Do you've any problem\nif I celebrate it today? What's your plan anyway? I must keep Seenu under my control\nbefore the tour begins. That's why this party. Where?\n- Asking me where? You invited them to the party, right? That? We are not going. Why did you then invite them?\n- I invited them wantonly. What will you tell him now?\n- I'll not pick up his call. I can't get your plan. First chapter in psychology. The more we ignore him,\nthe more his ego gets hurt. We'll gain the upper hand then. Can we go then? Whose birthday it is?- Yours.\n- Isn't it? Sit tight here. Poor man would've waited\nfor you all the night. I too want that to happen. May be it's them.\nWhat will you tell them? I'll say sorry to them. Nobody is here. No one's here. Why are you saying sorry? One who commits mistake\nmust say sorry, right? Isn't it Ram?\n- It's like that in our place. What have you done? You invited us to the\nparty affectionately. Isn't it mistake not to attend it, right? Didn\u2019t come? I mean I had to go out\nfor location hunt. I tried to call you and inform\nbut you never picked it up.\nI mean I had to go out\nfor location hunt. I tried to call you and inform\nbut you never picked it up. I think you're hurt deeply.\n- No...no... Don't lie, not hurt?\nI can understand from your face. Isn't it Priya? Isn't it Ram?\n- It's like burnt brinjal. No...no... Tomorrow morning at 10,\nwe are leaving for the tour. Here's your ticket. I think your friend is very sensitive.\n- Yes. Bloody! Don't you've any shame?\nYou're losing always, idiot. You're also joining us\nin the Swiss trip. Why me between you both? Between?\nIt all started with you, right? If she's the car, you're the key. I don't mind if she doesn't make it,\nthe trip is cancelled if you don\u2019t come. 0K3)!- Feeling embarrassed to cry before us,\ndid you cry behind closed door in bathroom? I've a condition if you want me\nto come to the tour. What is it? I'll come only if my friend\ntoo joins me. If not the tour is cancelled. he has already given me the ticket. They make us wait for two hours yesterday,\nwhy did you say sorry to them? Silly girl! She's trying to use her\npsychology knowledge on us. She doesn't know I know\npsychology better than her. Elders told me stand on my own legs. Then the world will be yours. Great! What's the meaning of it?\n- I too don't know. Amitabh said that long back,\nI'm repeating it now. Get in the car. Your seat is that one. No, I'm afraid of sticking to him\nif I sit next to him. He's not a man but magnet,\nhe'll pull you towards him. Come and sit here. Bet cancelled?\nYou're staying away from him. I've opened the second chapter\nin psychology. Before this trip ends,\nhe'll come and stick to me. Tell me. How far your job has come? Presently we are going in a train.\nTravelling together. You mean she's on the rails? You can take it on rails and derailed too. Derailed? Train?\n- No, the girl. Finish the job fast and come back,\nNarsing is suspecting something fishy. He's inquiring about you. You don't worry sir,\nI'll finish the job and come. It was Machiraju. Hi brother! How are you? Preparing for the exams. Now? Combined studies with friends. Your brother?\n- You don't need to know. She's afraid of her brother. What does he do to fear so much? Her brother is...\n- IPS! IPS means Police Officer, right? Hyderabad shivers at the\nmention of my brother's name. Dad, tell me. Europe is fantastic. People here are fair like cows there. Indian scapegoat! Remove your leg. Very beautiful. It was soft, I mistook it for seat.\nWhere's 12 C?- Here. Are you a Telugu man? Are you also Telugu? I thank God sincerely for\nmaking me meet Telugu people. Take your hands off. I'll cut your legs, bloody! I was punished by God,\nwhat can I do? If you misbehave like this,\nyou're bound to get punished. Bloody fool, this side not that side. Why are you bothered\nwhen we don't mind it? Poor man is visually impaired. Well said, dear.\nWhich school are you studying, baby? She's not baby but maiden. She'll be 16 years. I'll not believe it. I'll not accept a day more\nthan 17, that's it. Isn't it?\n- Right. What's your name, man? Pithre? What's that name? My father is Marathi. My mother is Telugu. I've a kid sister too. What's her name? Have all Pithres settled in Europe? No, we came for sight seeing Europe. You can't see, right? You see with eyes and\nI'll see with heart. Though God didn't give us eyes,\nhe gave us power to see with heart. Well said. How did you come to Europe and why? I had a soft drink to quench my thirst,\nit had a coupon, I was lucky to get this Europe trip. I cried my heart out, when I can't se\nmy own place what will I see there? My people said it was God's\ndestiny and put in the flight. You don't worry, Pithre. Sit back properly. I'll bear Pithre's expenses. I'm fine, how are you? I'll come back after the job is done. For me? Marriage? I'll marry any girl you\nselect for me, aunty. If you ask how she must be... Go back, have you turned deaf too? I'll send a photo to you now,\nit's okay to me if she's 50% of it. If you ask me how she shouldn't be...\nJust a minute, aunty. Stay like that for a minute.\nStay still. I'll send another photo now, aunty. Face shouldn't be frowning like hers. It seems I'm marrying. What do you mean?\nHave I frowning face? Would you like to see\nhow a frowning face looks like? Will your friend react so much\nfor telling truth also? Can't expect everyone to\nbe like you, right? Are you so beautiful, Priya? Didn't you see it with your heart?\n- I saw. Come, Pithre. I suspect he can see.\n- You confirm it, I'll finish him. Beat them boys! No...no.. please...no brother. Bring him down.\nIt seems he'll tell the truth. Isn't it you who is standing in the front? Tell. Was you father an Englishman? Laugh? Tell me. I work for Machiraju. Don't irritate him with your\nbroken English and face death. Tell him the truth. Seenu has left for abroad. I don't know anything\nmore than that, sir. True sir. If Machiraju has sent Don Seenu\nto foreign it means.. ..he's making Don Seenu do\nwhat his men have failed to do. What could it be? Hello Pithre, come back. What's this troublesome\nfamily package? Who is this again?\n- The same man. I told you to go back. What's going on here, Seenu? That's what happening here?\nSit there. Yes...yes... Background is fantastic,\nlet's shoot here. Remove the cover.\n- I've already. This lens cap. You must manage it. Bommana sari, thin like onion peel. This is Chandana sari,\nyou'll not feel it on you. Why are you getting late?\nLight is fading. What's your problem? I want traditional dress. Where's the balance dress?\n- That's entire dress. He's too talkative and\nshe's very proud. I'm stuck between them.\nWhat's this? Looks like you've ordered\ngood food, I'm hungry. Keep it here.\n- Take it. What's this sir? It's round. Fruit?\n- Fruit? Don't you want it? You'll not get it again,\nRam, you have it. You'll live. No problem. I'm getting good smell of\nchicken very near. We were lucky to get at least this. Will you eat or shall we eat it? No problem. Where's the fruit?\n- He ate it. I think they're going to kill me\nwithout food. Get up carefully! Purse is gone. She has to come to us for money. ls it joke to you? It's common in Europe.\nYou lost just a silly bag. Silly bag?\nThat bag had my mother's locket. I was keeping it with me as\nremembrance for my dead mother. You can't understand it's value. You don't have any emotions\nor sentiments. Eat, it may get cold.\nEat. Don't feel.\n- It was my mother\u2019s only memorabilia. Why is your face like that?\nShut up. If you bread eaters can be so proud, I've grown this body eating raw chilies, how proud should I be, then? Are you mad? This is not India. It may not be India but I'm an Indian. I too have sentiments. Check if your mother's locket\nis there or not. Unable to do anything\nother than just watch. Are you still here, Pithre? I'm blind, where can I go without you? But we missed our train. Take off. Missed it? How can we go now? Can't we go if we miss the train?\n- How? Why say sorry to me?\n- I was little harsh in emotion. With the same emotion\nhe beat them black and blue. If I had eyes, not one of them\nwould've gone alive. They would've taken your limbs too. Please don't hurt him. Generally women don't trust good men. They trust Pithre like men only. You're saying something, Seenu. Have you stopped at\npetrol bunk for petrol? Got caught! How do you know it?\n- I mean by smell. I need to use toilet,\ncan you please help me? You wait, I'll help him. Please help him.\n- I'll help him. Where are you take me? You wanted to empty bladder, right?\nI've brought you to toilet. Piss.\n- ls it toilet? Yes, I'll close the door also. He has put me in a fix. Why did you come out without pissing? A bus entered the toilet. It would've run over me,\nand I would be dead. Will you piss there? No, I'll piss tomorrow.\nYou come. No problem. You're bleeding and you say no problem. It's bleeding heavily. You're feeling more than necessary. It happened because of me, that's why. Got it! Friendship, right? It has hit the road!\nIt's on line now Our contract ends with today.\nWe are leaving tomorrow. I want to give you a party\nto celebrate it. ls it some thing like we missed once? Not like that. Isn't it for friendship? I've found the medicine to\nbring back his eye sight. Bloody cheat. Really it's good news. But how?\n- Mexican chilly! Switzerland Ayurveda. If we cut and put into eyes,\nthose with vision will lose it, those without vision will get it back. Will you put into my eyes? Then do it immediately. Thank you very much for your affection. I don't want it.\n- We want it. He's very hesitating type,\nyou don't worry about him. Cut it and smear it.\n- Do you've scissors? Come, let's give him treatment. I don't want to see this bad world. I'll go away, leave me.\n- Sit down. Do you know what will happen\nif I put it into your eyes? I don't know. It'll burn so much that\nyou feel like dying. If you bear it,\nyou'll get back your sight. I don't want. Please remove the glasses. Please cut it. Just watching it is giving me eye burns. No please...\n- Why not? I'll lose my eyes.\n- Lose? You'll get it back. What are you saying? I'll get it back only if I don\u2019t have,\nI'm not blind. Please say it loudly again\nso that they can hear it. About what? I'm not blind. I played this drama for the\npromise given to my father. I can see very well. Please give me a chance.\n- Take it. Do you see with heart? I mean when I was\nchanging dress that day...- I saw it You saw me too?\n- I saw! I saw but couldn't see fully. Will you see if you could see fully? Stop it Seenu! If I see you again in Switzerland,\nI'll cut and fill it with chilly powder. You look classy but speak like mass. Though studying in foreign,\nfor abusing our language is best. Don't try everyone, you may get hurt. What's this?\n- Don't you know it? ls it rule that men must have drink\nand women must have juice? What's that? A little of it can make even\ndreaded terrorists sing. Seenu will be fine, right? Do you've any problem? He loves me but not coming out. Once it enters body,\ntruth will come out. Why did you bring four more? If girls can have one,\nwhat's wrong if we've two each? We must drink fully and go flat. How come it's so strong? Are you okay Seenu? So many girls had fallen in love\nwith you, didn't you love anyone? Not anyone.\nWho will dare love me? The work I do is like that.\nWhat do you say, useless man? You're drunk, let's go.\n- Where will you go now? She'll feel hurt. Who were those girls\nwho said I love you to you? They? Hired girls!\nHe brought them. Do you remember?\nHe gave 50 instead of 100. He\u2019s cracking jokes.\n- Jokes? My foot! Didn't you pay them, bloody broker? Let's go... You don't know what you're blabbering. Why did you do all this? Attract! To attract and get attracted.\n- You mean? To make you fall in love, we played\nmany dramas and faced difficulties, please tell her, man.\n- But you said friendship with me. My foot friendship! This is the dialogue every man\nuses to get loser to woman. Stealing my bag...and that fight? That was real and genuine. In fact you started liking me\nfrom there only. You played drama and\nI too played my part. You love me and I too love you\nvery much. Agree this. Why are you feeling so much? Why? Really I'm in love with him\nwithout knowing he's a cheat. He too loves you really. How could you say that\nafter listening to him? Truth is that he didn't drink the beer\nyou mixed with that substance. I saw it. I saw Deepthi adding that liquid\nto get the truth out of me. But I didn't drink that glass.\n- ls it necessary to tell the truth? He wantonly told you the truth. If he was cheat, he wouldn't\nhave told you the truth. I felt it was not good to achieve\nmy goal using a girl. He truly loves you,\nthat's why he told you the truth. What will you tell Machiraju?\n- Truth! Only those who commit mistakes\nbow their heads, not those who love, Seenu. You acted well and opened\nyour heart to me. Don't you want to know\nwhat's in my heart? Beauty is spread like banana leaf... Waist is small like mango leaf... Shining and bright like lotus leaf... Soft like betel leaf to caress... If I don't get it after having\nall these qualities... I'll get irritated...I'll be vexed... Don't brandish like a dagger... Don't come on to me... Don't pull me with an anchor... Don't try flattery to trap me... I'll come to you myself... You please don't come...\nplease don't come to me... Golden bird...treasure of beauty... Your ravishing beauty is\nmouth watering... Ant hill...don't kill me... If you want my kisses, take it... O girl, you are a magnet... You've attracted my heart... Young mischievous boy\nis hot like chilly... He lit fire in my chill body... I'm crazy and see heaven.... My brain is blown away... If you want to see bliss,\ncome with me... If you want to taste heaven,\ncome to me... He saw me and pinched my heart... He weighed me as it is... You're very fortunate to get me luckily... Why do you always escape from me? When I see his speed... It's love attack... There's a talk we both have a link... Brother...brother...where's brother?\n- Upstairs! What? That Seenu...Don Seenu.\n- Have you found his whereabouts? I've found him, brother. Machiraju has sent Don Seenu to\nGermany to trap your sister in love. Would my sister fall for any fool? She's Narsing's sister. Fire! Who told you? I heard from Machiraju's men getting\ndrunk and blabbering in a bar. Mistake, Machiraju has\ncommitted a grave mistake. He interfered in my business,\nit's okay. My heart...my sister is my heart. He's interfering in her life. He'll pay for it dearly. What should we do about that Don Seenu? It seems he's arriving tomorrow with\nyour sister at Samshabad airport. Let's send him directly to\nburial ground from airport. Don't miss him at any cost. Go! Stop it, we've reached Hyderabad. All the passengers are coming,\nwhere's our man? Here he comes! Where is Narsing's sister? Hey! That's my sister! Got him? Did you find him?\nWhere is he? I'll never pick your phone call.\nGo to hell! I was working for Machiraju\nsince boyhood. I did everything he told me. Will he promise to make Seenu\nas next Don leaving me? What is he doing?\n- Babu is not picking the phone call. Why not? Where is he? I'm hurt. That's why I showed Machiraju's\nsister to Seenu wantonly. He fell in love with her. Now the real story begins. Now Machiraju will kill Seenu. That will clear my line.\nI'll get back my position. What if Machiraju knows the truth? If he has his calculations,\nI too have my own calculations. Who is it? Who is the fool\nwho called me at midnight? It's me Machiraju!\nls it midnight to you at 10 am? I've become lazy for\nGermany weather and water. Why didn't you come to the airport? I wanted to see happiness in\nyour eyes and I too missed it. Missed it? What can I do? I had work and so missed it,\ncome to Golconda fort a 4pm with her. Golconda fort?\nShe'll come flying. No need, bring her normally.\n- Okay. Why did you ask im to come\nto Golconda with Deepthi? He...wanted to soot him...\n- Hi brother! Why are you so tensed?\nWho are you so angry on? No, I'm peaceful, happy\nand pleasant, look at me! Maintain it like that brother. No tension will bother you, brother. From now on all of you\nmust maintain anger. Not maintain, its management, brother. I mean maintain it. Okay, let's have breakfast together. Sorry brother, I'm going out\nfor breakfast with a friend. Did you see brother-in-law? You caled him and\nhe called Deepthi immediately, and she\u2019s going for breakfast with him, look, how fast they are, brother-in-law! Shut up! What the hell are you talking? Why are you angry on me?\nWhy not ask the same with Deepthi? How can I ask? What can I say\nif she asks how do I know? Should I tell her I sent him there? Are you her brother or broker? Why did you call him so badly, sister? How dare he sends a man\nto love his sister? That broker brother will not die easily, he'll get crushed under some\ntrain or bus, blood sinner. Shut up! What are you blabbering? Why are you getting serious\nif I talk about TV soap? TV soap? A soap made by people of Kadapa, it seems a man sends another man\nto love his sister. I warned you to stop watching\nthat silly serial, right? Tell me anything but\ndon't stop me from watching serial. Forget about this, why did you ask\nhim to come with Deepthi? To kill him right before her eyes. With him the love will also die. Tell him the truth.\n- No, he'll beat me. Why are you hiding it from him?\nNo... What are you whispering there?\nSpeak loudly! Are you going to Golconda fort with her?\n- It's common. What if Narsing comes to know about it? Let's see when he knows.\n- He already knows it. Knows already?! 0Knows already? What are you saying? That you work for Machiraju and\nyou went to foreign on that job. Who told him?\n- We!\n- You? Why?\n- Why?! We were hanged upside down and\ndipped into water for six times head on, truth came out. Told him the truth,\nyou've ruined everything. I knew something like\nthis is bound to happen. But didn't expect so quickly.\nI'm going back to native place. No Rama Rao or\nNageshwara Rao, go away. Please move sir, I need to go\nto my native place. Why are you escaping without\neven brushing your teeth? I'll brush teeth in my home.\n- I'll take you to a man. Will he brush me?\n- He'll brush you so very well. Where is Don Seenu? Are they good? I told you about\npeople who brush you very well, it's them! Bring them, boys. I've seen him somewhere.\n- Come I say. You wait here. Brother... How will they kill us now?\nKnife or gun? Whatever it is,\ngun is better for Don range. Bloody! Wants range in death also. I shouldn\u2019t have picked up\nyour phone call that day. I wouldn't be in this danger now.\n- Shut up! He's coming... \"'8 gun! It seems you're an expert\nin trapping girls in love. Stand properly. Hey silly sidekick!\nAre you from Chakrapalem? Who are you talking to sir? Why are you seeing behind?\nYour brother is here, look at me. I'm going to kill this expert\nin two minutes. Reason?\n- Shut up! Am I running any shop here\nto give reasons for my actions? You beat Duggal sir's son,\nworse than that crimes is... you went to Germany to trap\nmy sister in love, but... But I didn't love your sister, right? You're right, look at the photo. That's it. ls she his sister?\nThen...who is she? How would I know? You're alive because\nyou didn't love my sister, if not I would've killed you\nin the airport itself. Why did you get down\nwith Machiraju\u2018s sister? Have you trapped his sister as his man?\n- I know it now only. It means death has shifted\nthe place to there. Get ready for it. Why are you playing like Tom and Jerry? Tell me. I came to the city to become a Don, to attract your attention and\nbecome member of your gang, I beat him in pub. But Machiraju is sharper than you, sir.\n- Shut up! He reacted sharply and\ntook me into his gang. As soon as I joined the gang\nI asked what my first assignment is, to kill anyone?\n- Stop! Get out! He asked me to\ntrap your sister in love, sir. How dare you go there\nto love my sister? If not me, someone else\nwould've gone, sir. That's why I trapped his sister. To get closer to you.\n- What have you told him? I lied to him that\nI've trapped your sister. Am I a kid to believe\nanything you say? Won't you believe me?\nIf you've doubt ask your sister. She knows everything,\nshe'll tell you. If my sister says okay,\ncontinue in your job. What are you saying, brother? My sister is getting married to\nDugga|\u2018s son this month 22nd. I'll arrange your marriage too\non the same day. I don't mind if Machiraju plays with me. He interfered in my family matter, he must know what will happen\nif he interferes in my family. Marriage on 22nd?\nJust 15 days only! I need your sister's co-operation to\nmake her agree for the marriage. My sister? I trapped her with Priya's help only.\nIsn't it? - Yes sir. Without her help this mission wouldn't\nhave been successful, sir. Believing me, he's ordering to\nbring your sister to some place. It's okay if you need my sister's help. If you try to advantage of her,\nyour headless body will run in parade ground. Why would I take sir?\nI'm your biggest fan sir. Why don't you tell him?\n- Yes, he's your biggest fan, From today Seenu is my man. That is...what's my position here sir? We are here for 10 years,\nwe don\u2019t know what's our position? You're here forjust 10 minutes only,\nyou want position. Shut up! I'll fix your position\nas per your talent. Till ten you're my sister's body guard.\nGo! What's this drama, brother?\nIt's danger if Duggal knows tt. Am I foolish like you? Let's make Machiraju go mad getting\nSeenu married to his sister. Duggal will come to know that\nMachiraju didn't kill Seenu. Then, let's kill him and\ngift his body to him. I'll not marry him.\n- Tell that to your brother. I can't tell him,\nthat's why I'm asking your help. If I tell him that he'll crush me\nlike these betel nuts. Bye. Aunt...aunt... Why so many twists? Did Bobby show us the right girl? Or did we misunderstand him? Let it be anybody's mistake,\nour lives are in danger now. I don't know who is playing\nthe game with whom. Let anyone play game with anyone,\nI'll be the winner at last. I'm clear about it. Just now we talked about her.\nShe appeared immediately. How are you? You...what are you doing here? I came for you only. You don't know about my brother. I've joined your brother's gang\nto know about him. Are you mad? Leaving your profession,\nare you joining a goon gang? For you only,\nnobody is watching us, right? You heard it right. You love me..?\nThen Deepthi? Please don't talk about her. Deepthi had a bet with you\nto make me fall for her. I had a bet with him to\nmake Deepthi fall for me. I won! In that process I never expected\nI'll fall in love with you. He's shocked! Aren't you? Yes, right now. I've taken so much risk to\njoin your brother's gang. I know your brother will kill me\nif he comes to know this. But my life isn't important to me. Your love is more important.\nTell me now, don't you love me? But what about my friend? She may be your friend not mine. She lied to me that her brother\nis an IPS officer. If she loves me really,\nhow can she lie to me? I'm a photographer,\nI told her the truth, right? Isn't it?\n- Yes, you were photographer from boyhood. Take your own time. Till then, we can be friends, right? Come, let's go to Golconda fort.\n- Why there? If he fails to go there, he'll die. Why do you always talk\nabout unnecessary things? I've promised my dead mother to\nbring my lover to Golconda fort. This is new twist now? Not new twist, it was there\nfrom beginning. How many times do I've to tell you fool? But my brother must permit.\n- Then, ask your brother. I'll go out with Seenu, brother.\n- Okay. You remember about parade ground, right? I do boss, I'll take care. Please keep it secret from Deepthi. If she knows, she'll definitely\ntry to break our love. Our love?\n- It'll happen. You go.\n- Okay. You freshen up and come,\nI'll wait here. Bloody! How dare you show my sister\ninstead of Narsing\u2018s sister? What can I do? You always compete with Narsing\nfor everything. You always do whatever he does. He sent his sister to a Germany college, you too got your sister admitted\ninto the same college, they both have become friends, I showed him his sister only. But he fell in love with\nour sister who was next to her. ls it my mistake? No it was my brother-in-law's mistake. He should've sent me,\nI would've loved her clearly. You say the grass is ours, cow is ours,\nhave you ever tried to milk it? If you milk it, you'll get a lot.\n- What? Milk? Talent! Don't irritate me. Seenu is a cheat. I had always suspected his motives. He wantonly loves with our sister. Let him come, I'll kill him.\n- Brother-in-law, he's coming. Today he's dead. How come he's here with Narsing's sister? Narsing's sister?\n- ls it? Let me see.- See! It's ringing, answer it.\n- No, it's yours. He's calling me.\n- Talk to him. Boss, I'm in Golconda fort.\nWhere are you now? I'm also in Golconda...not here. I don't know where am I,\nI've left on an urgent work. Charminar.\n- I'm in Charminar. What's this boss? You didn't\nturn up at airport or here also. Do you know how risk I've taken\nto bring her here? Okay, I couldn\u2019t make it twice,\ntalk to her and come home. Let's discuss there. I'll come. You hide! He's seeing us.\nSlowly...slowly... ls this the place your mother loves? I forgot completely about it. My mother's soul will be\nsomewhere here only. Mother...mother... Mother! Your daughter-in-law is here! Check her complexion.\nCheck her figure too! Isn't she up to your mark\nand expectations? Why isn't there any reaction? Why are you crying, Priya? Do you love me so much? What you saw is not much? Thank God! I think my mother's soul would\nrest in peace now. My heart is seeking something from you... Sweet danger...come I'll fulfill it... The honey drops are drenching\nand moving me... Your tender alluring hot lips\nwant to unite with mine... Did I say to if you wish to come? Would I say no to your kiss?\nDon't tempt me and leave, my dear... Would I not come if you call me? Would I ever deny anything to you? All of me am yours... I'm always after you.. I'll die for you... My life is yours... Will you come?\nWill you give your heart to me? Will you give your youth\nand your beauty to me? Will you come and charm me? Will enchant me with your sweet talk? Will you steal my beauty? Will you give your beauty to me? Will you give me the feast\nof it in moonlit night? Will you bring more of it? I Why didn't you come there\nand now here? You could've come and seen her, right? Who did you love?\n- Who did you show me? Narsing's sister! It seems you came to the\nairport with another girl? That rat faced girl? She's the\nmost arrogant and proud girl. Shut up!\n- Why should I? I can scold her for\ntwo full days non stop. Why are you calling her informally?\nWon't her family feel for it? Bloody family! Why would they feel? In fact I must kick the man\nwho brought her up. She's my sister! ls Deepthi your sister? I didn't know this.\n- Why did you slap me now? Shouldn't you tell me that'\nDeepthi is boss sister or not? Shut up! If I knew this,\nI would've looked after very well. Now I'm able to understand. Now I'm clear Her sharpness, her intelligence,\nher helping nature, her alertness,\nwhere did she get all this from? Blood, your blood!\nShouldn't you tell me that or not? No sir, what I'm trying\nto say is... Are you in love with Narsing's sister?\n- Any doubt? No doubt, but I need to confirm it. What do you want me to do? Make her accept your love on phone. That's all? Switch on the speaker phone. Tell me. I told you I love you. Won't you tell me that? Few things must be understood\nwithout saying it. Some people will understand\nonly if you tell. Sa\ufb01s\ufb01ed? Who are you asking?\n- My soul! Once more please.\n- One more time please! Why?\n- I mean it's asking again. Who?\n- The same soul! Have you cut the line?\n- Yes. Do you've any more tests for me?\nHang me to death! I suspected you getting carried\nby trusting these fools. I'm prepared to face such things\nand entered this field. By the way another news for you, Narsing has fixed his sister's\nmarriage wit Dugga|\u2018s son on 22nd. 22nd? It means we still have 15 days. You must elope with his sister on\n21st and marry her in a temple. In a flash he'll lose Duggal\u2018s\nrespect and become mad. But our love hasn't come to\nthe stage of eloping. You've still time,\nbring it to that stage. Then I've to use your sister\nfor few days. What did you say?\n- Don't get angry sir. I trapped her with your sister's help.

If I've to get the red,\nI need to use the white also, right? You must.\n- You fix up your mind. Red coin?\n- Narsing\u2018s sister. Whit?\n- My sister. My Sweet boy! Where are you Seenu? I think she's in deep love with him. I'll be happy if you're with me.\n- I'm coming... Where's your sister's room?\n- Why? Upstairs! Don't tell my sister that\nI had sent you to Germany. I'll not tell even if you die. Tell me.\n- Atlast we got the sharpest man. A small disturbance, tell me. What am I to tell? You didn't call me after\ncoming to India. Do you really love me? Can't you look into my eyes and ask tat? How am I to ask?\nYou never showed up. Turn back and see! How did you come inside? I've your IPS brother's permission. I thought you'd go away if I\ntell about my brother, so I lied. What did you tell to gain entry? I've convinced your brother\nand joined his gang. I'll tell him about our matter\nslowly, don't worry. In his gang?\nYou're fashion photographer! Why are you taking this risk?\n- For you...for your love. What is your plan really?

Every product from hairpin to plane\nmust be from my company in your country, you'll get 20% cut.\nthat's final, tell me. It seems they'll not et you step\ninto their country for less than 50%. Tell him, that's final. ls it so urgent?\n- Machiraju is on line. Very important. Tell me what's it? You've fixed your son's marriage\nwith Narsing\u2018s sister, right? Yes. So what? His sister is planning to elope\nwith another man on 21st. She's in deep love with him. If it happens,\nI'll lose my honour in public. Why should I believe you anyway?

Do you think he has come from Bandar? He has come from Bihar. He speaks in Hindi,\ndo you know Hindi? How will you deal?\n- Shut up!

Here comes my lion!\nYour job is over, Bihari! It seems a man from Narsing's\ngang beat him, find him and settle his matter. Who beat you? Who beat you? Who beat you? Can you describe the man who beat you? Why are you so scared of him? How can we take action\nif you remain silent? You can do nothing... Why are you running away\ngiving half details? Don't you get good cases other\nthan mad men like him? Brother-in-law, he forgot\nand left the money here. Shall I return it? Give it to your TV soap sister.\nIt'll be useful for your fodder. Bloody bull! Where ever you go in this city,\nyou'll find me. Which ever door you may knock,\nI'll only open it. It's good for you to leave\nthis city forever. I'll call on your home in Bihar\ntomorrow at 10 am, you must answer my call. Get going! Who is coming?\n- Duggal's man! Duggal's son and\nhe are coming together. Who is Duggal\u2019s man? - don't know, they're coming to\noversee the marriage arrangements. It seems Duggal trusts him\nmore than his wife. Duggal's son is here. Who is the man in dark glasses before him? May be he's Duggal's man. Have you reached the place?\n- I'm getting down on escalator. Getting off the last step sir. Toilet is near. I've been holding it for long,\nif you permit me, I'll go to loo. Why are you telling me all this? You wanted me to inform you\nthe details minute by minute. Not all this nonsense,\nbut about the love matter there. Find the man Narsing's sister is in love. You see it with your eyes and confirm it. Till then I'll not sleep too, sir. Keep this a secret.\nNot even to my son. If anything goes wrong...\n- I'll cut my head and send it to you. Had a happy journey? ls he your father's right hand?\n- Yes. I'm Narsing\u2019s right hand. You didn't take bath, right?\n- How did you find t? I'm dog like man. I can smell and find anything. I've heard of fire man, iron man,\nwhat's this dog man? If Vishwas is my name,\nloyalty is my motto. Come sir. Greetings sir. Groom appears little over aged. He's not the groom,\ndon't welcome anyone you see. Enough, will you do it all the day?\nCome on, take him in. Please come in. You've only men, don't you have dogs? We are like dogs to our boss. I didn't ask about faces,\nI asked about minds. Brother!

Give him a tour of our home in English. What's going on there? Just now we reached the home\nin a Benz car, people mistook me here for the groom, by mistake they welcomed me, I almost died with shame. Why are you telling me\nall this nonsense? Tell me about the job you're on tere. Narsing\u2018s sister is very lovely. There's a good chance of\nshe having lot of lovers. Come...come to India,\nyou insist to come here, right? You'll die in two day of this hot sun. A man passed by me, I changed the\ntopic to divert his attention. How dare you beat my man in my home? Am I not your man, boss? He left me alone to face 40 men. What can he do if you get\ninto unnecessary trouble? Would you leave if it was your sister? I'll kill him. I did the same, but he's still alive. ls that girl more important\nthan brother\u2019s word. Brother! He said sister, right?\nSeenu, you're a man. You said the same a day before also, is Seenu only man,\nare we not men? Not every man who pisses isn't a man, he's real man who makes\nother man wet in his pants. He's a real man. For trusting me,\nand for understanding me. What's this boss?\nWhere did you find these men? Same voice! Same voice! The same...it's the same man... Same voice! Who was talking here now? What happened?\n- It was Don Seenu\u2018s voice! May not have seen him properly\nbut I do remember his voice well. ls it you who spoke now? I think there's trouble inside,\nI'll call you back again with updates. You..? ls it you who spoke now? Not me sir.\n- Who is it then? ls it you? ls it you who spoke?\n- Not me. Isn't it you who spoke now? He can never speak, poor man is dumb.\n- Dumb? But the voice I heard jus now..? His thrashing is giving you\nnightmares and hear his voice always. Though he has forgotten the thrashing,\nhe remembers his voice, he's great. Anyway, Don Seenu is dead long ago. Seenu, just die temporarily. Why is he getting so excited? He feels that Don Seenu must die in\nour hands and not in Machiraju's hands. When are you leaving to Goa? I'll be back in a week. Same voice! ls he really dumb? Show Vishwas his room. I'll not stay here,\nI'll stay in the guest house. I've many things to do. He'll elope you, take him with you. I don't want him.\n- Why?- He's dark. I'll take him, he's fair. He's dumb, he can't read or write, he'll not be of any help to you.\n- That's why I want him. I know how to use him. How come he's like Akai. Come here. You know Praveen is coming here,\nwhy did you let Seenu stay here? He's smart, that's why he managed\nby acting as dumb. If not things would've gone wrong. Get the luggage. Do you've a phone?\nAren't you dumb? How can you speak? You can hear the other man\ntalking to you, right? What will you do to call\nthe other person? You're much better. No need of outgoing and\nno response for incoming. Don't smile please.\nCome. Sit down. No problem, sit down. Sit down...sit down I say! ls your madam having boy friends? What do you mean by it?\nNo? Or you don't want to tel. No!\nTell me the truth. Girls is...fire...burn if you touch it. My foot! I've medicine which can make you sing\nor anyone tougher than you also. Not that medicine.\nThis one! I'll beat you! Tell me now.\nDoes she have a boy friend? You said she's fire and\nwould burn on touching. You're very talented. How long she has been\nmaintaining the lover? Why have you become serious? How long she has been...\nI got you. Take it. You mean for long time. Where will she meet him? Where will she meet him? Why do you go silent for everything?\nWhere will she meet him? Why are you dancing? I got it, I mean she meets him in pub. Which pub? What's that answer when I ask which pub? Asked you in which pub she meets him. You mean Touch pub. Sit down. Do one thing, keep this. Get lost, you fool! What are you saying now? Didn't expect this?\nI'm like that. Nobody can judge me. I'll freshen up and come. Do one thing, plan what you\nshould buy with that 100 rupees. Come to pub, I want to meet you. I'll manage and come there. Will you also come?\nWhat will you do there? Will you watch? You're a kid, you must see or\ndo anything quite strongly. You stay at home, I'll go. Stay in home. Don't you've manners? Just name is touch,\nmustn't touch anyone here. If she's here, it means her\nboy friend will be here only. ls he here? I'll fix him. Who is he? How come you're so cool?\n- I'm always like that. My brother is making all\narrangements for the marriage. I called you here to give you relief. You don't worry.\nI'll take care of everything. How did you manage to come here?\nWhat's this dress? Where did you steal it? C\nPeak? I can use choicest epithets\nin Telugu, want to hear it? I mean there's another man like you... I shouldn't ever see you again\nin this vicinity. How far sir? Don't ask about distance,\nI'll break your nose. ls he the same man or another man? I think it's better to call him. Where are you now? In home? Don't cry. I'll come back in an hour.\nCut the line now. I'm sure it's not him. What man? Just came to wash my hands. Still hanging there like a bat? Are you feeling sad for not taking you? But there's another man\njust like you in this city. Exactly like you. He's no ordinary man. He'll murder or rape\nand blame it on you. I'm smart so I found it's not you. What happened to your inquiry?\n- Information we got is true. The girl loves a man. Narsing has cheated us. Yes sir, what do you want me to do now?\n- Come back tomorrow. Why hasn't the call come yet? -f Duggal ahs any shame or sentiment,\nhe'll definitely call you. Leave it brother-in-law,\nsuch silly ideas will never succeed. Won't you ever be positive in life?\nBloody bull! If you get the phone call,\nbeat me with your slipper. You've got the call. Not only you, I'll beat your\nsister also with slippers. Be careful...no anger please.\nTalk to him...it's Duggal. You were right. His sister loves someone. Not only that, they've planned\nto elope also. Marriage is 10 days away, I've invited top businessmen\nindustrialist and politicians in Asia. My status and respect,\nnever allowed any setback to it. But now I'm losing it because of Narsing. You don't worry sir, if you say yes, your son will marry\non the same day at the same time. How?\n- Shall I tell? Your sister...Germany... My sister too studied in Germany\nas Narsing's sister did. She's twice better in every\naspect over Priya. If you fix your son's marriage\nwith my sister on the same day, it'll be like beating Narsing\nwith a slipper. What do you say?\n- It's okay to me. My son's marriage is fixed with\nyour sister. On the same date. Till then keep this marriage\na secret with Narsing. Okay.\nYou start marriage arrangements. My sister is becoming\nDuggal's daughter-in-law. Your idea has changed my life. What's this brother? You're so happy! Dear, you're lucky, you're going\nto become Duggal's daughter-in-law. Duggal? One of the top 100 rich men in this world Distribute sweets. How much ever they may celebrate,\nthis marriage will not happen. Have it. That same TV soap?\n- Yes, how did you guess it? I'll kill and bury you, go inside. What's this Seenu?\n- I'm also confused. That's okay, will you tell my\nbrother or shall I tell about us? I'll tell who should know it\nand how to ell about it. In relationship I'm your father. My name is Shahenshah. Duggal uncle! Who are you man? I'm your future daughter-in-law's\nfuture husband. Will you accept anyone's proposal, uncle?

If my guess is right by now the phone\nmust be ringing in another place. Where are you now?\n- Just now reached the airport sir. Taking the boarding pass. The girl giving it is very beautiful. Her dress is also great. Tear it first. Will she agree? I didn't tell about her dress,\nthe boarding pass. I cancelled the marriage\nwith Narsing's sister, and fixed the marriage\nwith Machiraju's sister, it seems she too loves someone.\nI got the news. Go to his home,\nget it confirmed and call me. I've a doubt sir. Don't girls in Hyderabad keep quiet?\nThey find lovers so easily. First be on the job. What's this \u2018Varudu' get up?\nIt's irritating. The man coming now is very close to Duggal. All of you must behave\nlike gentlemen, got it? Play it! Stop it! My boy arranged music band\nfor your arrival. Welcome please, play the music. Your house is very good. I need an assistant to make\nmarriage arrangements. Use my brother-in-law. He's fat, I don't like him. How about Bobby? ls he dumb?\n- Me? Dumb? Why dumb? I'm comfortable with a dumb. It'll be favourable to me. Hi brother! My sister Deepthi. Duggal's man, he has come from Dubai. ls he the man to inquire about me? She's ravishing,\nI'm sure she'll have a lover. ls it? Confirmed. Where have you arranged my stay? I'll book any 5 star hotel you prefer. I'll stay here only. I must arrange the marriage personally. Yes, you must stay here only. My brother-in-law has arranged a\nparty tomorrow, you must enjoy it. Take his luggage upstairs. ls he man or dog? How dare he inquires? I must kill him by poisoning\nhis coffee. That'll be the end of his pain. Take your coffee.\n- Have you added it? Two spoons, you want more? One is enough to die, right?\n- Die? She said she has added poison. Not in this, sir. In a TV soap the groom sends a broker\nto inquire about the bride. I was talking about him.\n- About TV soap? Stop watching those serials\ntill the marriage. I'll stop if the marriage happens. Aren't you still married? We are married years ago.\nMy sister's marriage. Sister's marriage? You have this coffee. Did you go to Machiraju's house?\n- I'm in their house now. If Narsing's sister is beautiful,\nMachiraju's sister is very beautiful. There's a chance of having\nat least 10 boy friends. This is a matter of our prestige.\nInquire it quickly. I'm on the job sir. What are you doing at this hour? At this hour?\n- I'll do when I get the mood. No problem, right?\n- No problem. Over?\n- Over. Go to sleep.\n- You too. Let me see what they are doing and then... I'm dead! Yoga again?\n- No, water. It's in your room.\n- A fly into it. Give him some water.\n- Can't you bring it? Thanks, bye.\n- Go to seep now. Keep quiet Seenu,\nwhat if anyone sees us? Did any fool see from the keyhole? Who is it?\n- May be cat. It's cat. Stop romancing,\nfirst decide about our marriage. My brother has fixed\nmy marriage with Duggal's son. Do you know that? I know it.\nThat's why I was so happy. Are you happy? How many girls would be so lucky\nto become Duggal's daughter-in-law? But please don't forget that\nyou're the father of our child. Father? Did you hear any voice now?\n- No. Our child will become heir to\nDuggal's family, you silly girl. You'll deliver the child in\nthe world's best hospital. At their cost.\nName him as Vijay Duggal. They'll bear the expenses\nof the function. Send him to the best school\nin the world. At their cost. What else can I expect more\nthan it as a father, Deepu? Isn't it? Your child at our cost. Isn't it wrong to cheat them, Seenu? They cheated many to reach this position. It's not a sin to cheat them.\nI'll take care of it. Will you meet me after the marriage? Every day. Every night our duet\nwill play on. ls it him?\n- Yes. Everything will go on as I say,\nyou just follow me. You don\u2019t do it,\nI'll do the following. If your son marries her,\nhe'll get a wife with a free son. True sir. They've decided about the son's name also. It seems it's Vijay Duggal. Are you telling me the truth? There's another worse truth than it. The man who loves Priya and the man\nwho made Deepthi pregnant are same. You're confusing me.\nI'll kill you. No need sir, if you don't believe me,\nI'll kill myself. Okay, I'm coming there.\nYou stay there only. King Raviteja... Come to me like a race horse... My beauty door is open to you,\ncome my dear... Take away my virgin beauty... Has the love drug taking its effect... Seek my pouncing embrace... Come into my arms... Go little away and\nrun into my arms... My love thirst must get\nquenched right now... Our lips must unite in love... Must settle the love accounts\nthen and there itself... Must add oil of kisses to\nthe fired and charged mood.. Start the fire of love passion... With the love bug bite,\nand after things have reached this... Let the shame slip out from you... Okay, take my heart... Marry and take me with you... It's fun all your life... I'm your queen and\nyou're my king... I'll give my soft cheeks to you... I'll settle the mischievous account... I'll rake up passionate\ndesires in you... I'll lit fire to the desires... I'll take on the man,\nI'll give half of the share... I'll electrify your nerves... Why did you call me here urgently? I'll tell you,\nexpecting another person too.- Who? Priya, you here...? How many times I had called and\nsent messages, but no response. Germany is okay, you know our\nbrothers are enemies here. Why did you call me here urgently? Do you love Seenu?\n- Yes. You know that, right? What about you?\n- Are you mad, Ram? How can she love...\n- You stop. Do you love him or not?\n- Yes. Stop...stop... That's why called you both here. He says he loves you and plays game\nwith her in the garb of love. He has joined your brothers'\ngangs and playing with them. He's putting his life in risk.\nDo you know this? He's not a fashion photographer. He ran away from home 17 years\nago to become a Don. He resurfaced again in Hyderabad.\nI'm scared about his life. Not only that, I've come\nto know a truth about him. What? Let's wait for a day and go for\noperation if there's no improvement. Why is he saying about operation?\nI'm scared. You don't worry,\nI'll take care of it. How many are you taking\ncare of like this? Why did you come here? They didn't come, I've brought them. First answer them.\n- Who are they? This is not the right\nplace or time for it. Take them away from here. We're not here to go\nwithout an answer from you. Who is she?\nAnother lover? Don't you've an answer?\nTell me Seenu.- What can he say? You said you love me, without my knowledge you\nlove my friend too, are you living with her now\nwithout our knowledge? What's this Seenu?\n- You keep quiet, sister. Sister? Sister?\n- Yes, more than that. I reached railway station\nafter running away from home. I was confused where to go,\nthere I met uncle and sister. What are you doing at this\nhour here, Seenu? I ran away from home because\nI don't want to stay in hostel, uncle. Father, let's take Seenu with us. I'll come only if you promise not\nto send me back to Bhavani. I joined as an operator in a theatre\nin uncle's native place. Don Seenu?\n- Yes. Do you want me to write\nin the register like that? Write like that only.\n- He got me admitted into a school there. The took care of me like their own son. What?\n- I've passed 10th class, sister. After I passed the 10th class,\nmy uncle took me to my place. They are not staying here,\nthey left long back. Come. The theatre where my uncle worked,\nowner's son Narsing & Machiraju were friends. One day Narsing saw my sister. They came closer and\nblossomed into love. But Narsing's father didn't\napprove their love. I'll marry her only,\nwhether you like it or not. He loves her so much,\nplease accept it. I never said no, marry her. We were very happy about sister's\nmarriage with Narsing. Narsing's father had a scheme laid\nwith Machiraju after agreeing openly. Just a day before marriage... Narsing's father had accepted marriage\nand planning something behind him. He has planed to spoil your\nmarriage tomorrow. But Narsing wants to marry you\ntonight in a temple near by. He has asked me to bring you.\nCome...come... Let me inform my father, brother. Machiraju took my sister\nwith his word play. Machiraju gave her drug added\ncool drink as per his plan. What are you saying father? You trusted your friend\nMachiraju too much. Now he's having fun with her. Sir, Machiraju took my daughter\nto some place. I'll not believe it. Seetharamaiah's daughter is going\nwith Machiraju in the last bus. I made a mistake, please forgive me.\n- Mistake? How come you're here?\nYou said marriage is in a temple... Shut up! It wasn't Lakshmi's mistake,\nI brought her by force. She's a good lady,\nplease don't beat her. Do you want me to kiss her instead? Please listen to me. Do you think I don't know about\nyour eloping with him? Elope with him?\nYou asked me to come, right? What are you saying? Never again show your face to me.\n- No... Not in life! Please trust me. I'm not like that.\n- If I see you again, I'll kill you. I haven't done any mistake,\nbelieve me. Unable to bear this insult, my sister\ntried to kill herself with the child. Sister, please don't jump. What's this dear?\n- Father. Panduranga Rao got us thrown out\nof village by humiliating my sister. I had decided that day to teach\nlesson to Machiraju and Narsing. For your brother's mistake,\nhe's father less though he's alive. Unable to bear it,\nmy uncle fell sick. Deepthi, I never cheated you,\nI love you sincerely. For hurting you in the name of love... No need of sorry.\nI must thank you. You did all this for\nmy sister-in-law, right? We are with you from today. What's all this? You said you've a job and\nbrought us to city. Were you doing this? You know them very well. May be they'll take you\nalso away from me. No, let's go away from here. No sister, they played with your life, I too can play games,\nthat's why I had started it. I know how to finish it. Your sister loves Seenu but yet\nyou wanted her to marry my son. Don't make wild accusations, Duggal sir. Did that fool tell you that? Not just said it, I had\nproved it to him directly. You proved to me that\nNarsing's sister loves Seenu, but you hid the fact about your sister\ngetting pregnant with same Seenu, and fooled me. Pregnant? This is lie.\nDon't believe it. That's true, this fool had\na scheme for my sister, and her sister got trapped in it.\n- Stop it. It wasn't your sisters, who were affected, my son and my honour. I must know the truth now.\nFirst get that Seenu. You'll understand the entire game. You've made the right point,\nI'll call him now. You'll know the truth. How does he know Seenu?\nHe says he'll call him. He's the man responsible\nfor all this confusion. He got down from Nissan 5315. He's coming towards us, sir. He's wearing green shirt. 0l've eyes, I can see, right? I got used to giving updates. Tell him that you love Narsing's sister. Seenu, tell that fool how you\nturned the tables on him. They say my sister is pregnant,\nif it's true, I'll lose my honour. My sister is my life. Why are you silent? I'm behind you, come out\nwith truth without any fear. May be he's dumb, sir? Who is he between us? I mean there's a man just like him.\nHe's very good boy. I'll kill you. Don't create new confusion. I've a doubt he could be that man... Seenu, I beg you, her life will get ruined. Tell him the truth. If you want me to ell the truth,\nyou need to come out with truth first. Tell me, I'll tell the truth as you say. What's that truth? Sister! This character wasn't there in my inquiry. Did you recognise her? You made everyone believe that you\nhad an illegal affair with her, and ruined a girl's life who was\nabout to marry your friend. Tell him the truth now. If I tell the truth,\nwill you also tell the truth? First tell him the truth. I don't have any affair\nwith her, Narsing. What you saw that day or\nheard were lies. I played a drama for the money\nyour father had offered. Lakshmi is good lady. How dare you betray friendship!\n- Stop! The mistake you made in\nthis is no less than him. You left my sister believing lies. It wasn't one life which\ngot affected that day, two lives! The day you left her, she was pregnant. Yes brother, he's your son. I'm ashamed to seek your forgiveness too. Can you forgive me? It's a family reunion, sir.\nTears in my eyes, sir. You too join them. In your competition for one upmanship, you didn't bother about\nyour sisters' lives. You couldn't bear the thought\nthat I'm pregnant, 1 isn't it mistake to cheat\na pregnant woman that clay? It was mistake.\nPlease forgive me. You're a man! Thanks, brother-in-law.\n- Stop that acting. Are you done with your\nfamily sentimental drama? I'm not here to see your family drama. I've arranged this meeting\nto bring you all together. Why meeting? Where is Don Seenu?\n- He died long back. He killed him. The man who beat my son Don Seenu\nis here and you're playing drama. How do you know it? I told him. Yes, I'm Don Seenu who thrashed your son. What the ell will you do? Just a small bullet is\nenough to kill you. But I don't want you to die so easily. How you had tortured me? BOys! Just the name Don Seenu\ncan't make you a don. They are real dons. They'll shred you into pieces. What you'd said, sir? Duggal uncle! Good show! I was waiting for this scene\nsince my childhood. Till now I crushed on Don Seenu\nfor family sentiment. Now he's coming out with revenge. Duggal uncle, I like him very much.\nHe'll get the worst. Who is Don?\nYou're not Don. There's a Don in every\nstreet of Tamil Nadu. If you claim to be Don,\nI'll hack you. Don brother-in-law,\nthese dark guys must turn red, I don't know how you do it,\ntheir cries must reach home. Dubai gang has escaped! What did you say? ls there a on in every\nstreet of Tamil Nadu? Bloody! Who are you to decide that? Body is charged up now,\nlet's fight it out. Come on. Should I marry? What did you say? Are you a Don? Don't boast too much! Duggal uncle! Did you see\nhow fast the scene changes? I saw... If you leave me,\nI'll make you all India Don. Now I know you haven't\nunderstood anything from this. Do one thing, go to Dubai\nand mind your business. If you don't then I must come to Dubai. I was waiting to tell you and go. How many times will you get me into fix? This is last.\n- This is last! Go...go away... I've a doubt sir.\n- What is it? What happened to the dumb man? He's finished!  ", "7o-XGsYN7Kc": "hi and welcome to blazing air reviews today we're reviewing the XS go concentrate vaporizer [Applause] before we get started I would like to thank the guys that got beat calm let's send us the excess NGO that we're reviewing today if you'd like to learn more or to buy one please check out excess faith calm or got vape calm and you can save 10% off anything you order at those two stores with the code rough house 10 now let's get started here's what comes in the box with the access code there is a full-color instruction manual also there's the vaporizer unit itself you also have a bassist and there's an accessories box that includes a micro USB charging cable as well as a little dab tool there's also a couple of spare washers as well as an additional triple coil atomizer there's also the standard bent tip glass mouthpiece that comes with the unit and optionally we're also reviewing the hydro adapter which is a glass bubbler mouthpiece that is an optional mouthpiece for the exes unit at first impressions it looks really promising now let's take a closer look at the XS go vaporizer unit you can see on the inside that it contains a triple quartz coil now that's a pretty horse of a vaporizer it has an 1,100 milliamp battery so we're wondering if that's going to be enough to power it it also has a really sleek sort of a plastic-coated exterior is very smooth it has a micro USB charging port one single button and one single light that's a very simple unit if it's nicely and based and which holds it up pretty good and then you also have the glass tip mouthpiece which put slides in snugly on the top and also the glass bubbler mouthpiece slides in snugly as well and overall the unit one puts together that fits nice in the hand and it looks really promising it powers on one simple function you click it five times and it powers on for 10 seconds you can see it powers on those the coils are inside of the course so there's a course over the coils that's kind of hard to see that but that those ring the coils are actually encapsulated inside of that course and it it gets really hot you can tell just by want to burn off burns air gets really hot so let's charge it up and see how it vapes our wax we charged it about an hour and a half as instructed in the manual to make sure that it was fully charged we also put a small amount of water into the bubbler attachment and it traps it in nicely nothing leaked out so that's really nice we've had some of those that they leak into the vaporizer and destroy the unit but that one is really nice and keeps all the water trapped in I found the easiest way to use this was to take a good piece of your dab and we tried this with several different sizes of dabs and it didn't have trouble with any any size we put in there it baked through it pretty good and the best thing to do for us was just to drop it right there on there the top of the coils put your mouthpiece on click it five times to get ready because this thing really packs a punch it was kind of amazing look at that thing bubble nuts in there when it comes on it stays on for 10 seconds the light stays green while it's hitting temperature and then it flashes and cuts off when it's through its cycle and I got some of the biggest hits off of this off of any wax vaporizer that I've tried that 1,100 milliamp battery had no problem heating those coils up hits up quickly and it heats up more than enough the taste is excellent the quartz coil the glass mouthpiece the bubbler especially smoothes it out but with either mouthpiece you get a really clean taste of the vaporizer of the wax such of vaporizing itself no problems there and I'm telling you that the puffs on this thing you have to really be careful because you can hurt yourself because this this thing will give you as big of pulses you want to pull through it we tried it with lots of different sizes of dabs and like I said it vaporized all the size dabs with no problem there was a few problems that I have with it I have to say that this is one of my favorite devices to use it sits on my desk and I love it i've been using it consistently it's been hands-down one of my favorite devices that i've reviewed so far but that being said there are a couple of problems that I have with it and so let's get into the pros and cons my pros are is that first it has amazing big hits I mean really big hit you have to be careful they can hurt you the taste is excellent there's no problems at all of the taste it's very pure and then the function and the design is pretty much flawless except for my first con which that is it's not really pocket friendly it wouldn't really be a problem except for that it is called to go and so I kind of I loved it so much I really wish I could put in my pocket but the glass mouthpieces prevent that and also the elements may need to be replaced if you use it very often and you probably will and I went through one element in a matter of 80 or so cycles but overall I'm still it's way more pros than cons I'm giving it four out of five stars it's really awesome and one of my favorites to use personally in a while I'd like to thank again the guys that got bayt.com for sending the excess go that we reviewed if you like to purchase one or learn more go to Cafe comm or excess Paycom save 10% with the code

ain't you roll one up smoking along you're gonna take a big ol off Cheers let's go blast what is up fam alright so we are out my garage as you can see we are about to blast two cans of pure 322 with twenty three point five grams so yes I'm outside I have plenty of air movement out here so not worried about that got a couple things just in case this gets cold keep my hands nice and warm but let's see how this turns out I pre lie in my pan with parchment paper so let's see how it goes as you can see here's the lovely tube enough it'll show close up try not nice small little nuggets in there a little bit of a small trimming I guess you would consider a shake all frost if you've seen a couple beats with pics in it where it showed on them real nice frosty nugs that's in here so let's see what this product can do organic Sullivan peer 322 let's put this to test tears fan alright fam here goes one can about to start the extraction fifty three and a half grams of some fire frost so far not too bad on the fries in the hands so probably wouldn't even needed the glove actually it is getting cold though I could feel the coldness so it's slowly about the work towards almost where the field is at now so we should be seeing something coming with a couple seconds to the next king well know few seconds yep here comes now you can see it coming and pouring out so far it's super gold looking as soon as I can get the two cans I'll bring up an up close picture city off and check it out it's a really gold yellow yeah definitely smart to use this little oven mitt just for anything that rolls down the can it stops my hand from freezing end to one can going around to win the second can definitely a nice gold yellow super gold yellow but also when you got some nice frosty nug it should hopefully be some nice gold yellow here in a second I'll let you guys check it out you guys can tell me what you think nice comes out nice definitely ain't bad I think I'm going to try this again a couple different directions see if I can make some diamonds up with this so definitely keep an eye out and keep watch out for some more videos the Blasted is the next one probably going to be with some diamonds and then after that see what else I can try definitely next time I'm a vest in the stand because it does get a little tiring holding it but it looks like I'm have a good turnout there's still coming out nice and yellow it hasn't hit clear yet now just blows extra out cuz just air going through she does definitely get a little tiring with 2k after toucans yeah you'll probably not want to say you'll do this again without getting a stand one can ain't bad two cans your arm gets a little tired try it from all the pressure as you see it does get pretty cold so there's a wise choice to use a mitt all right I think that's all she wrote so I'm gonna hold this in this hand now I'm gonna bring y'all over so you can see some of this nice beautiful golden yellow look at that golden yellow so now we're gonna sit I'll be back I'll show you how it turns out we got a Ford 24-hour wait I will be back and show you the results cheers fan later what's that fam silver back as you can see it already started you've a parade a little bit decent amount look how golden yellow that is nice can you hear it you can hear the little book the bubbles fuzz and making a little fuzz popping sound this is really sweet so far I'm liking it but like I said we'll have to come back I'll have to check this out as soon as it's done we'll test out the product see how it tastes how clean it is the effects stay tuned much love fam later what is up fam so we are back it's been I don't know within an hour and at 62 degrees outside it is forming I would say like diamonds but maybe it's just because it's a little chilly so it's a little frosty like kind of like ice cube so it's going to take a little longer to finish evaporating but yeah just figured out a let you guys get a look update resuming here there we go see I like the diamonds but like I said it might be maybe because it's cold so we're gonna come back let you see how it looks here shortly peace alright so we are back again it's been I want to say another 20 minutes you can see it's a little drier now watch this when I give it when I blow on it a little bit to move the evaporation a little bit faster watch the bubbles and watch everything move around now that's pretty cool so as it finishes I will keep coming back with some updates much love and respect fam data alright fam so after about two hours I came inside cuz I

The molecule, not the marijuana No matter what you think of this compound, or how familiar you may be with it There is no denying that THC is pretty potent Its effect stems from its ability to bind to receptors in your brain called \"cannabanoid receptors\" And the reaction that takes place after that binding occurs Now, calling them cannabinoid receptors is kind of misleading, it makes it sound like they're designed to be stimulated by cannabis They're not They're receptors located on neurons and they're activated by chemicals called neurotransmitters Which basically allow neurons to communicate with each other Cannabinoid receptors are found in all different parts of the brain Their highest density occurs in the areas of the brain responsible for pleasure, thinking, memory, coordination,  time perception Normally, these cannabinoid receptors are not activated by cannabis, they're activated by a chemical called Anandamide And that neurotransmitter plays a large role in making short-term connections between nerve cells It's also largely responsible for the brain's ability to forget things Which is very useful in our normal, daily lives. We can't remember everything And it seems to have a hand in regulating our eating behavior As well as generating sensations of pleasure It's name, Anandamide, which is kind of a beautiful word, comes from the Sanskrit word, for inner bliss Anandamide, for what it's worth, has been found in chocolate Anandamide and THC belong to the same class of chemicals, which we call cannabinoids By mimicking Anadamide, binding to, and activating, those receptors, THC interferes with the normal functioning of your brain Well, your brain is now on drugs By attaching itself to a neuron, THC screws up communication between other neurons Let's say neuron one needs to tell neuron two to do something, like \"remember a phone number,\" Or \"hit a baseball with the baseball bat\" Well, if THC is bound to one of those neurons, that communication is more likely to fail And the person is less likely to remember that thing or hit that baseball So, roughly that's how THC affects the brain But, there are some other obvious, and interesting questions here, like: Why, on Earth, would a plant decide to make a chemical that does this? What. Wha- Why? To paraphrase the author Michael Paul, A plant does not go through the expense of making such a complicated and extraordinary molecule, and continuing to produce it, if it isn't doing that plant some good It turns out no one knows for sure why marijuana produces THC, but there are some fascinating theories The first: THC turns out to be really good at absorbing UV radiation And so it's possible that, since marijuana often grows at higher elevations, That it needs the ability to absorb that radiation without, you know, harming the plant THC also has some antibiotic properties so it's possible that that's how it's helping out plants It also may help us out Scientists have done studies and found that THC is a fairly potent antibacterial And third, is my absolutely favorite reason, and that's that other animals have these cannabinoid receptors too And it's possible that leaf eating insects have them, And that THC is there to put them on drugs So that they, like, forget where they found that delicious plant And they're like, \"Oh, man. I had that really good plant yesterday, but I can't remember where I found it\" Then they just end up, like eating cheetos, outside of a 7-11 at 2 am Which, you know, if you're a beetle, it's not so bad I live in Missoula, Montana. It's a college town, fairly high pot smoking population here Also a very high deer population I'm starting to wonder: the deer are always walking around downtown, with this, like, glazed look over their eyes And I'm thinking maybe they're getting into somebody's stash And now they're all addled, can't find where they found that delicious brick of marijuana on someone's back porch They're just walking around downtown, hoping, hoping beyond hope, that they'll stumble across one again Animals on drugs!

let's check out the percentage on this it's not too bad we're gonna go ahead and open this [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] look ya'll this is already opened it looks like their new packaging just stuck to the lid you know nobody likes to get an open [ __ ] like that especially when it's supposed to be sealed in Jack hair I have videos of that on my channel if you all want to see a review on those exactly but this is a $25 quarter true flour ground as you see look look this [ __ ] stuck to the lid that's not a very good presentation it looks like they changed it from a paper weird with tinfoil in that's kind of disappointing but whatever it 25 dollars for a quarter you can't really beat it so smell it definitely smells better Matt very sherbert I had on that last video but I found a seed in that one so we got here all right first off let's look at this look at all that key in there y'all I'm thinking about saving that for a video later on striping home a little jars out and making a badass bowl with some Keith here we go the whole quarter for $25 y'all can't be the shoes like eight grams you ask me check it out it smells really good y'all normally leave the video before I try it so I mean it smells so good it's got that uh smells like like a lemon orange scent I don't know it's not like it's not like berry fruit but it's like it's like a fruity smell citrusy orange the White Buffalo it's like got that diesel Kanna taste the jack herer like I said in the last video it's kind of a fruity taste that was really good if y'all want to check out my other videos hit him up um you made it this

"a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "JxVuBHMKSuU": "hi I'm Scott with Flex your rights we talked last time about some of the ways that a police encounter can get out of hand and even go horribly wrong and a couple of people asked the same question response to that video which is what do you do if police say they smell marijuana and this is actually a really tough question and for reasons that we'll get into it's it's something that you might want to learn more about even if you don't actually use marijuana the truth is that you don't have a lot of options in this situation but let me break it down for you and I'll just try to be as helpful as I can the reason this is such a big issue is that the smell of marijuana by itself is considered probable cause to believe there's a crime going on so as long as people lease smell it or claim that they smell it in most situations they can automatically search you and unfortunately the courts trust police officers to be honest about this which creates all sorts of problems and and that's why it's something that can affect you whether or not you're a marijuana user the smell of marijuana is something that the officer might bring up as an issue to sort of manufacture probable cause after you've refused to search and so that's why it's a big deal and so let's talk about about some of the ways that you can protect yourself from having this happen to you first and foremost we want to eliminate the possibility that you're actually running around reeking of marijuana believe it or not a lot of police officers aren't liars and they aren't going to just say that they smell pot if they don't so most of the time when an officer claims that they smell marijuana it's because they actually smell it and that's the reason that they think there's something going on that's why they want to search so so first of all we have to eliminate that factor and that's going to reduce your odds of getting jammed up considerably above all this means that you aren't ever smoking marijuana in your car smoking in the car is just the best and most efficient way in the world to get arrested for marijuana we get emails at Flex rates every day from people who got in trouble and nine times out of ten it had something to do with smoking in or around the vehicle that's just the number one way that it happens in my ex and and there's no there's no reason for it it just doesn't make sense I mean if you're so impatient that you can't you know drive for 30 minutes without sparking something well then you're gonna hate being subjected to a weekly your analysis when you're on probation after getting busted inevitably so cool it with that for your own good please and beyond that if there's anything in your car that might smell like marijuana for example a bag of it or an apparatus or what have you you know keep that stuff stored away and sealed up better yet keep it out of the car you know it really shouldn't be there unfortunately making sure your car doesn't smell like marijuana might not be enough it's really just the beginning if the officer becomes really suspicious of you they can lie or just imagine it even when it isn't there and for you that can be just as bad as the real thing because it means that that they now believe they have probable cause to go ahead and search the vehicle or at least that's what they're claiming another important thing is just to make sure that you keep your car clean in general because when police see a dirty car they think of drugs so if your car is clean the officer is just a lot less likely to even start with you again this is a preventative measure but you know it's it's important it really does make a difference along these same lines remember that police profile like crazy so if you're running around looking super cool all the time they're gonna notice you I you know I would never recommend that you tone down your style you know it's a free country and you shouldn't be afraid to be yourself and be awesome but also just be aware that if you have a distinctive look or a flashy vehicle it just means you're more likely to get harassed you know it's [ __ ] but but be ready for it I get emails all the time from biker dudes and people like that you don't even do drugs but are getting pulled over and harassed and searched by police all the time for dope it's just a dumb stereotype but but it's also the reality of how our laws are enforced particularly under the war on drugs think about what what you have with you for example if if you do fit a profile or if you have a history of getting harassed by police you factor that into your decision making about whether to make yourself vulnerable to a criminal arrest now the last thing and this is perhaps the most point of all is that you always want to assert your rights no matter what keep in mind that that when police say for example that they smell marijuana it might just be a trick they might just be trying to judge your reaction or scare you and they're looking for sort of these verbal or nonverbal you know cues from you your eyes darting around or your breathing heating up and these kinds of things that police officers deliberately try to provoke you to create those reactions when they're suspicious they may not be their intention to do a full search of the vehicle unless you give off some sign of guilt and so things like making references to marijuana you look stone you smell like pot these things could just be a trick and so you don't want to panic at that point and waive your rights you always want to refuse the search if they're asking to search the vehicle you always want to say no and if they're claiming to smell marijuana you want to respond the way that an innocent person would would respond and hopefully you are innocent because you haven't been smoking pot in your car so you say you know officer I don't smell anything or you know officer whatever you're smelling it didn't come from in here you know it may or may not stop them but it but it gives you a better chance of getting out of the encounter and most importantly if you do flex your rights and ultimately you're searched illegally if you're arrested as a result of illegally obtained evidence all of these things can be challenged in a court of law now probable cause derived by something like marijuana odor is hard to disprove in court it's very hard but an officer who for example would make a claim like that dishonestly may very well have a track record of making the same claim every time they pull somebody over and the search is refused and so you got to keep in mind that there's a track record here in a good attorney can get in there in a court of law and maybe even win your case so don't give up that's the important thing is to sort of be prepared for all these possible outcomes and this is a particularly tricky situation and one that sort of lends itself to a little bit of corruption and dishonesty on the part of police officers but if you're ready for it and if you make the right choices if you keep your car clean if you assert your rights even this situation is something that you can have a chance of driving away from safely and finally please do check out our website at flexor rights org we have a detailed

fill syringes specifically these small 1 ml glass syringes that we carry these syringes are a popular packaging option for high quality material but they can be difficult to fill so today I'm going to show you two methods that will save you hours of work especially if you have to fill hundreds or thousands of these things let's dive in the first method we are going to cover is the syringe coupler method this tiny white thing here is a syringe coupler we have them available for purchase and they allow you to connect a big syringe to a small syringe which is really cool because that is going to allow you to fill these at a much faster rate you're just going to take your larger syringe and make sure it's filled with your material then put the coupler on it by twisting it on to the luer lock then take the cap off your smaller syringe after it's fully assembled attach it to the coupler and begin your filth by gently pushing material from the bigger syringe into the smaller syringe after the fill is complete remove the small syringe from the coupler place the cap on it and there you have it a filled 1 ml syringe the second method will cover preferred method of filling because it does not require as many assembly steps which saves a lot of time there's a special tool that I'll be using to perform this fill and you can probably find it at your local sporting goods store or Walmart it's ten pound fishing line I have a roll of it right here first we're gonna cut about a four-inch section of the fishing line or whatever you can comfortably hold in your hand some of our clients like to take the fishing line and tape it to a chopstick or popsicle stick to make it easier to grasp but the basic technique remains the same you will still need a larger syringe filled with your material such as this 10 ml syringe I have here or you can even make this work with a filling machine you're going to start by taking the syringe you want to fill with a cap on and no plunger then place it in a position where it can be held upright luckily this is exactly how they come packaged if you buy from us then holding the larger syringe above the smaller syringe gently begin to fill the syringe from the top dead center taking care not to get any material on the sidewall of the syringe above the fill line this is actually really important after filling you're gonna place your fishing line into the syringe like this allowing it to hover right above the liquid then slowly push the plunger down and tell it meets the liquid inside then pull the vent cord out as you can see if this technique is used correctly it allows you to hand fill these syringes at light speed compared to other methods and there you have it a filled 1 ml glass syringe thanks for watching this video please

pull it apart with your fingers instead of a knife and a fork so we're gonna show you this it's really cool my brother called me one day goes Jack Jack here I sending a link check this out online there's this cool method of tenderizing your meat before you cook it and it only takes about between one to two hours depending how thick your meat is it could be as little as 15 minutes so let's uh let's show you how I went to the store and I bought the cheapest piece of garbage they had on sale yeah so cheap all right it was a dollar ninety-nine a pound it's all I could find there was ninety nine cents a pound I would've brought that home but it's called what is a select beef cross rib roast I don't know what that is I don't know bones in it anyway let me show you how to do this we're gonna do a side-by-side comparison I had the butcher take a thick piece and slice it right in the middle so we have two pieces of the same mistake all right so there's no question about this test if one comes out more tender than the other they're from the same steak okay all right so let's take a look all right to clean pans we're gonna open up these steaks but one and eat don't forget to wash your hands you haven't washed your hands now's a good time to go wash your hands all right okay once again I took one piece of meat and I had the butcher slice it right down the middle okay so there would be the same cut of meat ah beautiful I love beef as you can tell it just looks good so many things you can do with it you can cook it a million different ways this is not a good cut of beef okay I'm just telling that right now okay next thing you're gonna do is you're going to take sea salt or kosher salt and that's a very coarse salt and we're gonna take that we're gonna cover one of them completely with sea salt all right so let's do that right now okay so we're gonna do this now the rule is this find out how thick your steak is ours it's about an inch and a half okay so you're gonna have to leave this on an inch is an hour so an inch and a half would be an hour and a half once again every inch is an hour you leave this salt on if it's half an inch then you do half an hour quarter of an inch quarter of an hour all right don't be afraid to put too much on because we're gonna wash this right off when we're done but this is going to do something to the meat it's really interesting there we go I got the whole thing covered a little bit more down here all right there we go I don't know why this works I'm sure something you do and you can write me in and tell me but what's gonna happen is it's gonna pull the moisture out of this meat and it's also going to do something to the protein molecules it's gonna break them down and what's gonna happen is this simple piece of meat as you can see it's pretty it's pretty tough see how it doesn't there's no openings okay you can pull it apart okay this is gonna open up the meat it does something for the protein molecules I don't know the science to it I just know it works and I'm just gonna show you guys right now so we're gonna let this set for let's break out my measuring tape that is about you know what that's about a an inch and a quarter so we're gonna do an hour and 15 minutes okay I'll be back in an hour and 15 minutes to show you exactly one pock mouth notice there's no moisture or water in there just the salt no moisture or water in this one all right let's check this out in an hour and 15 minutes you're watching the cooking with Jack show we'll be right back right after this message hey how you doing jack sky Lonnie here just want to tell you about my line of sauces they're called the best sauces you'll ever taste that's right it's called the best barbecue sauce you'll ever taste here's the best hot barbecue sauce over taste the best teriyaki sauce you'll ever taste and the best gourmet seasoning you'll ever taste all of them come with a money-back guarantee and if you live in the United States of America I give you free shipping I'm pleased to announce that my friends in the great white north in Canada I have now set up an order page for Canadian orders I don't do free shipping but now Canadians can order the sauces too go check it out go to the best sauces com I'll see you there and now back to the cooking with Jack show it's been an hour and 15 minutes and you can see that all the salt has has really become moist it's pulling it's drawing all the water out of it you can also see if you'd if we turn this let me move this one over a little bit if you turn this you could see like the salt a lot of moisture down in there collecting and you can see where the water is coming out of the steak it's just it's just coming right out of the bottom so it's doing something to this meat so we're going to take both of these and get them prepared for cooking all right first thing you do is rinse the entire day of salt there we go get all the salt off it and look but you notices see all those openings look at all those groove openings it's starting to kind of kind of pull apart a little bit here it's really penetrated the mean get a good rinse now you can see it's it's right kind of very loose feeling I'll show you at the other at the table okay let's look up difference in the meat okay take a look at how this this has been not treated how it kind of just looks straight out of the butcher counter okay and look at this this is a lot more falling apart you can already see the grooves look at the separation you see that separation right there the separation right in there all these grooves that are created it just seems to be falling apart in my hands it's not quite as firm yeah we turn it the right way there we go there you go okay seems to have opened up the meat it's really interesting so there you go now we take these out we're gonna grill these now once this is clean of salt season both of these is however you want I'm gonna season them up then take them out to the grill bring them right back and then we're gonna do a taste test see if this opened up and got more tender than this one okay you just came off the grill I want to show you some similarities and some differences okay now I noticed while cooking these these were cooked on over their own flame each one had a flame underneath it on the barbecue they were cooked identically the same position same amount of time I pulled them off but the weird thing is the untreated one looks like it curled up a little bit right on this end and I don't we can see it but it kind of curled up and it kind of looked like it cooked overcooked or got well done but look at this one right here this one's interesting because this still I like my steak rare this looks rare and this looks well-done they look completely different if they look like they were quickly different completely different times so one more thing I want to do before I want to lift these up and which one has more juice before we cut into it okay okay this one definitely has more juice than this one but we're gonna cut into these bad boys right now let me bring over a plate this is the one season with the salt this is one not seasoned with the salt I'm gonna cut right into him we're gonna see exactly how they cooked oh yeah nice and rare okay that's beautiful let's take a look at this one same spot same thing you'd they're both beautiful let's take a look now and see let's see if one's more tender than the other I'm gonna try and rip this tear this meat open with my fingers it's pretty easy little nervy I like that was a little tougher than I thought but you can do it now let's go over here and look at this same spot that goes right through Wow that was beautiful that was a lot easier now I think if you left the salt on a little bit longer you would even have a better a better tenderizing procedure all right so here's the deal um take a piece of meat here Wow I know what I'm having for dinner there's one piece there don't want the same size here so we try this right now we let the meat set it should be perfect this is the untreated good seasoning Wow lots of pepper forgive me mmm I love black pepper okay it's really got a lot of flavor but it immediately toughen up almost all the juices out of it and it's now becoming harder to show now the treater one mmm this is more like a New York steak I think we've upgraded to a New York steak right here mmm it's breaking up real easy it definitely makes a difference I've done this before but I had to share with you guys mmm delicious I'm gonna get a little a1 I'm gonna sit down with these steaks and we're gonna have a conversation go you guys try it out write me send me pictures tell me I'm not lying please all right I'll see you on the next cooking with Jack take care [Music] [Applause]", "zYlGYKsDUls": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "4BaoyczmEX0": "- [Narrator] Resealable zipper bags are an incredibly handy product. You probably use them\nfor sandwiches, snacks, and even for some freezer storage. But over the last 50 years, tons of different uses have come to light. Today, we'll show you\neight alternative ways to put those zipper bags to work. If you're ever moving or\nshipping fragile items but can't find any bubble wrap, you can easily turn your zipper bags into the perfect packing\nmaterial with just a straw and some minty fresh air from your lungs. It's really simple. Just insert a straw into\na zipper bag that's sealed most of the way. Take a big deep breath and\nblow air through the straw directly into the bag. Once you're satisfied with\nthe amount of air in there, quickly remove the straw\nand seal the rest of it off. For a little added protection, use a long piece of tape to\nseal off the top of the bag. Make sure there's no leaks\nand you're good to go. For most people a vacuum\nsealer is more of a luxury than a necessity. So here's how to effectively\nremove air from a bag without a vacuum sealer. Start by filling up your\nsink or a bucket with water. Then seal most of your plastic bag shut leaving about an inch or so unzipped. Now, slowly submerge your\nbag of goodies into the water and watch as the pressure\npushes the air out and molds the bag around the food. This method works well on its\nown but it's best to push out any remaining air pockets before sealing the rest of the zipper bag. Although, a real vacuum\nsealer may be more effective, you're still reducing the amount\nof air in your freezer bags which helps reduce freezer\nburn and keeps your tasty morsels nice and fresh. Next time you're out playing\nin the snow or hear about some terribly cold weather\nheading your way, try this. Throw a couple zipper\nbags on your side mirrors. That way, when you come back\nto your car all you have to do is take off those bags\nand toss them on the floor for next time. No more chiseling ice from\nyour mirrors or brushing away snow when you're on the go. If you need to transfer some\nliquid or grain substances into a container with a small opening, try making your own funnel\nout of a zipper bag instead. We've shown you several\nmakeshift funnels over the years. But when it comes to pouring liquids, sandwich bags might be\nthe next best option. Just take a zipper bag and\nsimply cut off a corner, boom. You've got a temporary funnel. For added stability you can\nadd a piece of tape to hold it in place as you slowly pour\nyour contents through the improvised funnel and into\nyour intended container. Astonishing. Turn those ordinary\nsandwich bags into cheap, reusable ice packs in\njust a few simple steps. Start by soaking a sponge in water and placing it in a\nresealable plastic bag. Next, add some rubbing\nalcohol to the wet sponge. This will give it a gel-like consistency which keeps it cold longer\nand makes it more malleable. Put the bag and its\ncontents inside a second bag to prevent any leakage\nthat may possibly occur. Finally, place the bag inside the freezer and after an hour or so, the\nmixture should be nice and cold but still pliable. That way, you can manipulate\nits shape making it ideal for those occasional bumps and bruises. For added protection\nwhen you're on the road, you can actually reinforce zipper bags with strips of duct tape. Cover all the corners with\ntape including along the lower edge of the top. Then go ahead and blanket\nthe rest of it with more tape if you prefer. We left off a single strip to make it easier to see what's inside. But either way, you'll end up with a stronger, more secure bag for your items that's far less likely to puncture. If you're packing a suitcase, you should always avoid putting your shoes in directly with your clothes. The best practice is to\nutilize large zipper bags. This will help prevent\ntransferring dirt and other grime from your shoes to your clothes. If you're heading out on vacation, stick each pair of shoes in a bag to keep your clothes\nclean while you travel. Not to mention, keep your\nsuitcases stench free. When you're taking a road trip, it's usually best to pack light. But when it comes to creating a care kit, it's better to be safe than sorry. Grab a quart or gallon\nsize zipper bag and fill it with all your travel size necessities. Just zip it up and toss\nit in your vehicle's glove compartment or center console. That way, you don't have\nto keep those things in your already loaded bags. That just about does it for today. If you have any cool uses for zipper bags that we didn't cover, let us know in the comments\nas we'd love to hear from you. As always, thanks for\nwatching and tuning in. Make sure you're subscribed\nfor more videos just like this and see you next time.

labs I already made like two or three videos on it basically exclaiming to the whole [ __ ] YouTube world then I love bear labs and it was fairly priced and it was like for the quality that you for the price that you gain the quality it is it's something that I had to make a video on like I just had to show you and I ended up getting two more strings so we're probably just gonna open one today just because I want to I want to pace myself or I want to basically in moderation if this one's open already it's more of a I'm more inclined to to smoke it you know so if I just have one of them open I'll finish that one first before I finish the other one I don't want to have to and then I just be picking up both of them at the same time hope you guys can understand but you ready no bear labs this is both technical extracts and research labs you guys know I love the purple punch didn't have it this time but they did have Sunday driver and I looked at it and it looks fairly similar to that of the purple punch the white waxy texture and as you can see let's just see the percentage of THC one is 79 one is 83 so they're definitely high up there in potency once cookie and cream one is Sunday driver and I can show you the price right here I paid $20 for one I had to buy it twice I was buying one and then I was like can I pull out money at the ATM to buy another one and they're like yes so I bought two each for the price of 20 it says 20 31 but they rounded to the basically rounded no changed up in there yeah it's just gonna [ __ ] so I'm actually outside Randy's house and I actually don't have his file for him which is um basically the only reason I came here oh and to like smoke with him I guess but [ __ ] I just realize that now you know sometimes you like over plan and then you just end up not having all the stuff that you need you know happens quite a lot but you trying some of this like if I didn't have the spirit card right now I wouldn't be making this video thankfully I leave of spare SD card unless [ __ ] no they're God's God's do let me know in the comments if you've tried bear lads very very good stuff I'm gonna try their Sunday drivers there's no one I'm gonna open she could see right here very white looking I like I don't know just something about wax the lighter it is the better it looks you know it turns of wax that's what I usually [Music] not gonna lie guys that smells pretty phenomenal I'm just checking it got a good shot of it means very very nice it's not actually the same consistency of the purple punch but the same color nonetheless honestly it smells pretty good I'm pretty excited to try it so I'll let you know how how it tastes and everything right off the bat very easy to commit mess with very easy not as easy as the wax from their other stuff in the bubble punch still nonetheless [Music] [Music] cheers yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] very smooth very tasty actually but not as dirty as the purple punch but the flavor is there very enjoyable very smooth very light it's very light hit for how much that came out I usually would caught I mean just I kind of want to pack another one I'm not gonna lie because it is very light but it is running at a high percent of THC so well that was much easier to just drop in like that so take another one for you guys but yeah man check out bear labs for the price they're able to put their [ __ ] out for like the quality is definitely worth more than what they what they think they're worth so Cheers yeah definitely very tasty nice terpene like I said of the purple punch but nonetheless still still enjoyable experience I'm actually feeling pretty high right now I'm getting there and then Sunday driver is usually a good strain so yeah one more hit just clearing this one gotta clear the remaining Vinnie cheers guys last hit oh yeah I'm super high so yeah bear labs there you have it guys hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just a quick little review of bear labs one of my new favorite concentrate brands yeah nothing but good things to say about this brand but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "tLJ3ep3fq2A": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video chillin with the homie Stevie Wonder's subscribe to the homie I'll post everything right here and in the description below so if you are like interested in like hiking and vlogging he's your guy you know I'm saying so okay I'm gonna say the people oh yeah yeah also we're gonna be doing a review on this bear labs right here but Stevie will be providing his puff co which is right here put a fence around me oh you did yeah oh heck see guys I'm using the field I got my own feel the that point that tool I have mine just all right so I'm going to show you guys as usual on my camera and then sync up the video as usual so so it's the new ceramic and can you open this grateful diesel and another thing I mentioned I noticed on this it says hce I don't know she explained it right to me she need to explain she says like a method of extraction or a type [Music] if it is okay this plastic okay smell smell it's really like lightweight sweet this is really great fruit dad actually that's really actually like it's been about this here you take your first day you gonna have that walk hard but sure yeah I did and then you won't try it no you first so we're gonna try the bear laughs this is a bear last review we're gonna do another video after this just like a puff Co session should should be a pretty good because I didn't really smoke too much today because the reason I'm here obviously well first to kick it with Stevie but that's the second thing I'm here for it was to get my wallet I left in his car yesterday about a dip out of Vegas yeah tomorrow are you oh [ __ ] so he's gonna have a Vegas vlog that he well he's going to Vegas tomorrow so he's gonna be filming a vlog in Vegas so you get to see like Vegas during times of Crona virus if he never been to Vegas should be should be crazy yeah being at all see in advance get that kind of perspective oh yeah I just want to see the van to look so he's taking fat hit yeah the air conditioning is on in my car because it's pretty hot right now actually it's 83 degrees but oh yeah you like it 25:25 for these bear labs not bad the dollar cheaper than it's a very shook what consistency when you call this like a sugar wax yeah I don't like the white part bumble oh yeah they're butter better what was it the live resin question oh yeah yeah that wasn't really that good some of their stuff is hip oh [ __ ] it's melting did you double-click it no but it's melting is that double-clicking on the most anything wait and this is actually pretty good from the Casillas melting and I kind of got a hater hint of it cheers boys we're bigger of that you mean here pack another hip for the army even a q-tip it it was enjoyable it's probably one of the better but one of the best-tasting bear labs I've tried because it's very different from their ocean so we're gonna pack a fat hit for Stevie no I'm not a fan yeah that's great so we're gonna take another hit each and pretty much my impressions on the grapefruit diesel from barrel ass good stuff I do like the consistency of sugar wax it tends to be easier to [ __ ] with especially with the puff Co you can just get it on by a thread hanging by a thread and just drop it in there right the dev tool nice color nice smell the potency is so it has a total cannabinoid cannabinoids is ninety seven point one two with the total THC at eighty one percent with CBD point one so not bad and shout out to Stevie for letting me try as puff Co I know you guys have been like wanting to see me with the puff Co and this is like the second best thing from actually me owning one you know because you guys know if I have something to smoke out if I really don't need and the other thing unless it breaks and then I'll might consider we're gonna take another hit of this stuff I'm good though yeah and the thing is is the ceramic Meister I'm a born here it's my chaplain oh is it yeah so it's actually even though chipped it still hidden pretty good yeah it's chipped where's it you what how'd you chip it accidentally where you dropped it drop it on there like that - you tried it later what try what my words did you yeah hello try this so [ __ ] this is hce wax our live resin if you guys know what that means let me know as far as I'm concerned it just looks like regular old live resin to me but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video would I get this again yes I would would you consider buying this in the future yeah 25:25 for it yeah this was an authentic for 2525 but just because we paid the price over here in Modesto that does not mean over where you're at it's gonna be the same price so just be aware of that check check all your local dispensaries because even local dispensaries in your place we're gonna sell things differently so but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff if you want and I'll see you guys the next one [Music]", "L3iPrCn5zwo": "Money...money...\nmoney is omnipotent...

But how come l'm not behaving like you?\nMan must retain his originality. My foot originality! lf i did have,\nwhy would l befriend you? Eat! Mallesh is having problem with AK,\nl've come to you seeking help. You said any dog will give money.\n- That's why l'm here. l'm not getting salary for 3 months,\nrunning tightly.

You're blushing like a girl.\nThat's why l like you. Marry me! lf you marry anyone you like,\nyou'll end up marrying many. l don't have any idea of marrying,\nbetter let's be friends. l'll decide now whether\nto be friends or to marry.- How?

Nitin Varma from lMBl Bank\nis here for you, can l send him in sir? The necessity is yours not mine, sir. l came here knowing you want loan.\n- Who told you?

What magic did you spin? l got doubt\nnot hearing from you for 3 days. You trapped him so easily. Come. Take it, this is the file.\n- Are all the documents in it? What ever you do, do it carefully. Gaurav would've told you,\ndocuments are not proper. Moreover your company is\nalready in huge debts. Company's performance is\nalso not good. As far as l know no bank in this\nworld would lend you money. You told me to do something. Mustn't do something, must take risk, l'll take the risk for you, l want 2% commission on\nthe loan amount. 2% is very high, can't afford in\nmy company's present condition. Unless one is very lucky,\nyou don't opportunity at right time. What can l do?\nYou're not in my list. What's this? Tell me another figure. l don't think l'm getting you\na loan but asking from you.

Last month you arranged loan\nfor my company, you're responsible for\nour company's position. l think you're in a meeting. Where were we?\n- Rs.2 lakhs now is impossible. Call me when it's possible. Call me Reddy, l know you will call me. You will...come on...come on... l'll call you when there's a need. Come on call me... Where else can you go? Come to the lawn ad take Rs.1 lakh. Move away!

How long man?\nl'm drowning here. lt's not even raining,\nhow can you drown? No jokes, matter is serious. Stop nonsense and come to the point. My boss has smelled rat\nin your gamble. Last night boss met Frederick in bar,\nhe got drunk and told him everything, take to the heels!\n- Why? Few goons are coming to\nyour room with Frederick. Escape immediately. Why are you getting tensed?\nl should be tensed, right? l can't help you other\nthan giving information. Your fate! Living and dying here only! Hey! Fatso...tall boy! How are you guys?\nAre you doing fine? Fine. Few accidents separate people forever, but this accident united us after years. l think you're living well\nwith bike and car. l got a job in a good software company, salary is good, so a small\nchange in my lifestyle. My job is okay for my knowledge. But l'm tensed about\nmy mother's health. Who has tension free life?\n- What about you man? You made tall promises of changing\nand cleaning dirt in society, You promised to shake out\nthe foundations. Dig out graves!\nYou made idealistic speeches. What's this then? Nothing is our hands,\nby the way what are you doing? Having a ball!\nNot in the range you think, l'm planning to go to Singapore. l just returned from US,\npresently l'm staying in a hotel. l've urgent work, l need to go.\n- Okay bye. By the way, l forgot,\nthis is my card. Okay, l'll also take leave now. lf you don't mind, a small suggestion.\n- Tell me. Why not stay with me till you go\nto Singapore instead of hotel? You've AC?\nWater bed?- No. No problem, can't l compromise\nfor my friend? Come, let's go.\n- Come. But neither l nor Michael could anticipate\nthat Kranthi was hiding a truth. That day l understood, though we may have many ideals, but we all are just players\nin the hands of fate. None of we three could\nachieve our aims. None was happy.\nJust living for living sake. To tell plainly just living! Can you get me an omelette?\n- l will. Go. l think you stopped coming\nbecause l asked money. Did l maintain all these\ndays without paying you? Are you doing free service to me? Forget it, why rake up all that?\nDon't suspect me unnecessarily. You're national permit,\nbloody hell current. You remember, right? You love it! Good for health ! Come in Chandu. l think you know the matter. l know sir, thank you very much sir. You helped at right time, sir. Don't get excited,\nyou got work promotion only, no salary hike, don't feel too much,\nyou'd hand full of work till now, but now you'll handle\ncompany cash along with work. lnfact you can lend it\nfor daily interest. What do you say? l'm not such a person.\nYou know it, right sir? l know, do we throw away\nleft over food? We keep it in fridge and eat next day\nmaking it tamarind rice. lsn't it? Tamarind rice makes me remember... Sir, money for my mother's operation... Count it. Rs.4.80 lakhs. Deposit in bank. Why so little? Didn't you tell him quantity is\nmore important than quality? l told him sir. Change the hotel.\n- Yes Sir. Look, find a place where you\nget good tamarind rice. Go! Bloody gargantuan !\n- Bloody idiot! Sour! Please arrange the amount for\nmy mother's operation, sir. Chary told me, l'll try. Do your work first, go.\n- Okay sir. You want it? Take a puff! No problem!\nWhat will you take while going? Enjoy life happily and then die. Why are you irritating me? lf you cough again, just two tablets\nwill make you sleep forever. Drink! Sleep happily! Did mother trouble you?\n- No. Tell me the truth,\nmother didn't trouble you, right? What's this man? l'll not stay here\nif you talk to me like that. l'll go back to the hotel. No... She may be your mother but\nshe's my God given mother! Sorry for hurting you. What's the cover?\n- Office money. Please sit down. l'll confirm it on 3rd. Can you tell me the status\nof Singapore ticket? Try it on 5th. Where is it?\n- Sir that is... l told you to get chutney\n30 minutes before. Keep it there. Will you bring it so late?\nLook, hotdogs had gotten cold. These are good only\nwhen eaten hot, you fool. Go...wait. Get me hot coffee...go.\n- Okay sir. What about you? Have you started rotating money\non getting promotion? No sir, l'm not such a person, sir. l too thought like that only, l told you to rotate money for fun,\nand you stole Rs.50000. l think you're not as good\nas l thought, right? No sir, l really don't know\nhow l missed Rs.50000, sir. l don't want all this nonsense.\nPay Rs.50000 in 4 or 5 days. lf not, police, case, court and jail.\nDo you need all this? Please help me sir.\n- l can't do anything. Already matter has reached boss. Come to office with money. Go! Can l use office bike till then, sir? How can you?\nLeave the keys here. Keep it there. You can go now. You're great! What mummy?\nWhy are you looking at me? Do you think l'll have it\nwithout offering you? Would you like to have a peg? Why are you so angry?\nHave it, no problem. Your son's money,\nno need of tablets too. l'm dedicating a song to you. Let's enjoy it! No mother, father, no siblings,\nl'm a loner... No children, no marriage, no man to\ngive his daughter in marriage to me... No place, no name...\nNo companion...no home... l don't know who am l...\nl don't have anyone... Bloody, the fatso is back,\nwill you tell him? Don't tell him. l had drinks without your permission. l thought mother too would've\nsome change. What happened? Rs.50000 is missing from office money. Missed it or you stole it?\n- You too! lt was correct when l counted in office, when i counted in bank, it was short. l'll be arrested if\nl don't pay in 4 days. Mother's condition is serious.\nl'm confused. Please help me now, l'll repay you later. l'm running tight,\nl didn't get cheques from US, l wanted to tell you\nsomething since l came here, you're facing all the trouble\nbecause of this house, change the house immediately,\nvastu is very bad. lt's all my fate! lf you cry, would your lost\nmoney come back to you? l'm confused. Do one thing, go to your boss\nand fall at his feet. lf you cry before him,\nit may work out for you. For a man who has crores,\nthousands are nothing. But my boss' address...\n- You must find it. lf Columbus had stayed in home,\nwould he discovered America? Okay, l'll try and find my boss. Tell me! Prachanda is in Vizag.\nStaying in Rustom farmhouse. He's returning tonight. What's this? You were talking about society\nand social justice in student days. l'm still doing the same thing. l'm keeping up my promise. You mean killing people? l'm doing as a common man what l\ncouldn't do as a journalist. Doing the same thing but\nprocedure is different. This is judgement by time,\nl'm not an exempt from it. After college, when l started\nmy career as a journalist, l found myself a role model, but the path in which l chose to walk,\nhe was already running in it. Following him step by step and\ngetting inspired by his vibrations, l aspired to march ahead, he used to wake up the slumbering society, he used to stay awake to work,\nhis work philosophy was, Greetings. Just a minute. Fall at his feet! Sir, his daughter's marriage\nis settled, he says... l'll talk to you later. Greetings sir. ls it? Okay.\n- l got the contract with your help sir. Okay. Your fans sir,\nwant to get photographed with you. Move away! He's here! Not now please.\nl'm busy. Okay sir, we need you now,\nyou may need us in future. You too Prithvi!\n- What did we ask sir? A small party in outskirts...\n- Okay sir, as you wish. You got angry, right? come with me. Goddess mother! Don't know when\na landmine will go off? Sit down. l want to buy same model. Why are you getting angry for nothing?\nWhy don't you get married? You don't give me a chance. Why would you? You've us, right? Would you like to have sweets? l think you love sweets.\n- l love, but l've diabetes. lt seems you've frugal breakfast. But with hot chicken soup.\n- And at night two pegs of... Then? Three! You've collected good information. lt seems you got bribe of\nRs.150 crores in stationary scam, and allegedly were shifted\nfrom this Ministry. Your information is correct.\nBut the scam is wrong. You're right, if it had happened, you would've been\ndismissed from cabinet, why would they change your ministry? You always think right.\nThat's why l like you. Your brother-in-law...\n- You mean Bhikshapathi? Yes sir, has he left the\neducational institutions? What's this? What was l then?\n- You were Education Minister. So educational institutions,\nwhat am l now? Health Minister.\n- That's why pharmaceuticals. Well said sir. Spurious drugs have flooded market\nafter you became Health Minister, what action have you taken to stop it? l'm also worried, l'm thinking\nof instituting a committee. Committee's name? What's in the name?\nWe can have some name. Even cyclones are named\nas Laila, Shakira... lsn't it she? No name for such a serious committee\nor it was never formed. What do you say? Was it heaven till l came and\nturned into hell after l came? l didn't mean like that sir. But the allegations are growing\nafter you became the minister. Opposition's plan. The news about you participating in\na party thrown by pharma companies, is that also opposition plan?\n- lt was lftar party. lftar party?\n- Okay, garden party. lt wasn't lftar or garden party but\na cocktail party in a 5 star hotel, a party thrown by spurious\ndrug manufacturers, and your brother-in-law\nis the owner! That simple man is doing pharma\nbusiness for livelihood. Aren't you doing it to\nraise your TRP's? Sir, we've the right to ask you\non behalf of the people. We've the evidence. This is what you call half kg masala\nfor quarter kg chicken. You asked for 5 minutes and l gave\n30 minutes. l don't have time. Please drop him wherever he wants.\n- No thank you sir. l can go on my own.\nSir, my phone... Sir, stop eating sweets,\nif not blood sugar will raise. Please stop! Money can bring the monkey\nfrom the hill is old saying, now the hill will come to you !\nYes, this is true. Bureaucracy is walking to the money. Without considering the\nlosses in future, without considering\nthe qualifications, drug licenses are issued by our govt., the result is market is flooded\nwith drugs to make youth go crazy, is this govt. bothered about people's\nwelfare other than making money? ls this govt. working or sleeping? Our media journalist met\nHealth Minister regarding this issue. Before seeing his response... Was our conversation telecast live? What? lf it's live, watch it! Mine? Haven't you yet eaten the\nsandwich l sent an hour ago? Eat!\n- l mean... What a scene! Good! Forget about our scenes,\nwhat about your scene in public? What scene?\n- l saw near the door. That one! l've also been\nwatching for many days. You too, Prithvi! Stop acting and tell me\nhow far it has reached! Has it reached till marriage? Yes, just now had a discussion\non marriage. When are you getting married then?\n- The day you decided. Why should l decide?\nNo jokes please. Why should l decide? l must fix her for Prithvi.\n- Why are you dragging me into this? Truth, the girl wants to marry Prithvi.\nShe's eating my brain every day. l promised to talk to you. What's your reply?\nShall l say yes? l'll vanish you from here. l said okay. Won't you trust Prithvi? l'm Murthy here.\n- Where are you? Okay, what's the news? As usual, why did you go\nafter the minister? Watched live on TV. This is nothing, the bigger\nthings are coming. Real trouble for the\nMinister starts then. What are you planning for him? The feast is served on table,\ndon't worry about taste! Till then suspense!\n- Give me the phone please. Eat!- You're coming to the\ntrust tomorrow, right? Heard about such great people\nin history or in story books. Now seeing them live! How do you run such a\nvast organisation so smoothly. You need more will power than\nmoney to run such organisations. Prithvi has it. l too feel like doing it but\ngot stuck with family and duty. This is just my thought, l could do\nit with help from friends like you. What did we help?\nDidn't even help financially? Just lend moral support,\nmoney will flow on it's own. More than money\nyou need courage for this. Shall we go? Why are you also joining us? l gave her time. He works in media, runs this organisation\nand has time for girl friend too, how? Shall we've a coffee? Just a hour weekly visit is enough. l want the children in my orphanage to\ngrow happy and healthy like other kids. What else can make me more happy\nthan if you help us to achieve it. l'll meet you personally. What? Nothing, every girl dreams of life partner\nto be like a handsome film hero, but l'm seeing a real hero\nbefore my eyes. No reaction even for\nsuch a big compliment! What happened? l'm thinking. Thinking about how, when\nand where to marry? No, where to start it?\n- What? To weed!\nFind the root and uproot it! What are you talking about?\nl don't get you. The program we initiated! Before losing life... Bring a change in people... To shake up the earth and\nshatter the sky... To make this world turn\nand pay attention... You become a role model, come... You come like a wild fire... With available funds, paid MBA students fee and\nbrought systems for computer students, these are the bills for it. lf you want more funds,\nl'll arrange by week end. Okay sir. You send the bills to my auditor.\n- Okay madam. You wanted to meet Child welfare\nMinister for funds, right? He's in Delhi for party meeting.\nHe promised to meet after return. l'm Kranthi here.\n- Go ahead. Did l disturb you?\n- Carry on. l need to talk to you urgently,\ncan we meet now? Where are you now? Govt. issues licenses to many\npharma companies in city, but due to paucity of staff\nto check them, they leave out reputed\ncompanies on trust, and inspect only smaller companies. ls there any connection between\ntrust and inspection? Yes, there is. lf not\nl wouldn't have called you now. The trust with which don't inspect,\nusing the same trust these companies, make drugs that mainly target\nyouth of the lower middle class. Who is doing it? Gaining entry into the\ncompany is impossible. lf this is true, we need strong evidence. You say it's impossible\nto enter the company, but there's a way, what ever they manufacture,\nthey try to sell it, right? if we find how the\ntrafficking goes on. We can find it.\n- How? Name is Prachanda,\nbig name in society, address of black marketing,\nhe has construction business too, though workers work all the time,\nthe constructions remain unfinished, almost all his constructions\nremain unfinished, drug trafficking activities\nare operated from there only. That's why nobody suspects\nany wrong doing. Dr.Rao, back support of Prachanda, very strong politically\nand financially, till he achieves what he wants\nhe won't rest or let others rest. We are going there tomorrow. We'll get him arrested tomorrow\nwith breaking news. War ends with a word...\nLaw writes the reality... There's no Machiavelli\nto upstage you in history... Bury the word defeat... The struggle must reach a crescendo... Achieve the right path... To shake up the earth and\nshatter the sky... To make this world turn\nand pay attention... You become a role model, come... You come like a wild fire... Before losing life...\nBring a change in people... Why are you nervous? We did everything perfectly but... Right, but l'm little tensed.\n- You don't get tensed. Rao is in for bad time. l'm happy to see your confidence. You must have a coffee between\nwork and relaxation. Coffee can give temporary relief\nbut tension remains. You gave temporary relief\nto my tension. For total relief, quit the job. That's the greatness of this job. Our operation will be telecast\nas it is live. Serious topic or secret topic? What else can media\nand police talk about? Then, you're in for a feast!\nCan't you tell me that? No way, never trust police.\n- Then, l'll go. l didn't tell about you,\nl said about selfish people. Tomorrow's breaking news is about\ndrugs and heroin in Rao Pharmaceuticals. This is routine, you're coming\nfor tonight's dinner, aren't you? Am l that lucky? A function of Minister's grand daughter\ncoming to age near by, VlP's and VVlP's are\nattending the function, and we must ensure their security, if it's possible, l'll make it. Come. Sometimes power cuts are\nblessing in disguise. lt has disturbed very important work. lt's pleasant out side,\nlet's spend some time in balcony. l've very important work...\n- For my sake! We didn't spend time together\nfor long time, please come. Come please! Power is restored. Where is the cassette?\n- What cassette? What cassette? Are you acting smart? Will you kill 10 year old trust\nwith just one evidence? Look, getting rank in exam is important, it's not important how you achieve it, Doctorates, PhD's...\n- Positions an people, What you don't get in this country\nif you've money to spend? ls it difficult to buy you?\nWhat do you say? Not only for breaking news,\nnever worry about any news in life, When everyone is after money, is it\npossible to change for one man like you? You know about me, right?\n- Tell him. You don't know about me. Shall l tell who am l? l don't hear bad, see or speak.\nBut l make others do it. Media is like pigeon,\nit knows only to fly freely. But it doesn't know there\nare hunters down. Poor thing is just a bird! Yes, media is indeed like bird,\nbut not a pigeon, it's an eagle! lt can bring out with it's\nclaws any truth hidden in earth. l'll also expose your dark life. Do whatever you can ! What's the matter? Nothing, just came to say hello.\n- Come. One, settlement with silence, two, settlement with violence. They're very good men. They said buy him or kill him,\nl said we can't buy him, so they bought me. l've an idea!\n- Got it? For me? Leave me...\n- Prithvi, you've good taste. You've to edit, dub, re-recording\nfor our news to come out, at least it'll take 12 hours,\nbut the video l'm taking now, just pressing of send button is enough,\nin minutes, people can watch if. Now you're press and l'm also press. Prithvi, you're a perennial threat. You...l'll not kill you. Oh blood! She's dead! lf we miss anything we love,\nwe get dejected, what if we lose people we love? lt took me long time to\nget out of the shock. Two people lost their lives because of me.\nl'm still feeling guilty of it. Feeling guilty. To get out of it, and to bring peace to\nsouls of my friends, to achieve my aim of\ncleansing dirt in this society, l felt it's right to kill such elements. You were so soft to feel hurt if\nanyone speaks uses harsh words, how could you talk like this? Experiences will change your opinions. Forget about me, why did you come there? Missed some money from office account,\ncame there to request boss. How much?\n- Rs.50000. Okay come. l'll repay as early as possible.\n- No need to repay. l'll not tell anyone. Be careful, take care of mother. Both kidneys of your mother are damaged. She needs transplantation.\nDonate your kidney. l think donating mine is difficult. Any other sister or brother's\nkidney will also do. They will also not give,\nl'll find if anyone is ready to sell. The sooner the better. Please sit down. Hesitating to donate a kidney to mother\nwho is on dialysis with kidney failure. l'll donate my kidney, inquire if\nthey're willing to pay for mom's operation. You all are having wrong\nnotions watching films, it's not possible to transplant\nanyone's kidney to anyone. Moreover, donating kidney\nis dangerous too. Look, stop these senseless ideas\nand arrange funds for surgery. Your mother's condition is very critical. Moreover specialist is going\nback to US in two days. You're right doctor,\nbut getting so much money suddenly... As family friend, l'll give up\nmy fee and theatre rent, l can't help you more than it. Are you crying for boss' death? Change the feeling, l can't tolerate it. Doctor says mother needs\noperation in two days. You mean 48 hours. What you couldn't do for so long? How can you arrange so\nmuch money in few hours? You don't have any other\noption than Kranthi. How can he have so much money? How do you know he has or not? Did you see it through magic glass\nor did you ask the octopus? Don't hesitate, call him. Who is it? You're lucky! Ask him. l need a small help from you.\n- Help? What's it? Nothing, l need Rs.6 lakhs for my trust, can you arrange funds using\nmy land documents? You know l don't have\nmuch connections. l'll try elsewhere. What did he say? He's also sailing in the same boat. He wants loan against land. Feeling sad can't solve our problems. Then we need Rs.12 lakhs immediately. Why do l need Rs.12 lakhs\nfor operation? Rs.6 lakhs only, right? Your mother's operation cost and\nl've to go to Singapore, right? My uncle doesn't run airlines. Do you also need money? You earned well, right?\n- No, l lied to you. My position is worse than you. l'm waiting for a good opportunity.\nNow the chance has come. l must save mother at any cost.\nPlease tell me a way. We must do something. To get Rs.12lakhs immediately,\nwe've to rob a bank. There's no other way. l'm ready, tell me\nwhich bank shall we rob? l said it for fun. No time for fun, l must save my mother. ls it you who's speaking like this? Necessities change your opinion. So, you say we can rob\nfor mother, right? l've a plan.\nNow you've joined me. Came for a party near by,\njust remembered you on the way. So what? l got wet. On this cold night, let me get\nburnt in your fiery eyes. Let me melt in your hot burning\nembers of your embrace. Let my every desire get solace.\nLet all these moments see heaven. My heart is beating... Why don't you stop once\nand pull me towards you... Why don't you show me bliss\nand raise my pulse... My shyness slipped and\nsubjugated to you... These wet lonely moments... These desirous silent moments... Must be like lotus leaf...\nDrop down from you... l must be the girl in your arms... These lovely shadows...\nThese lovely errs... l'm swooping down like bee,\ngive me your honey... l want to turn your night\ninto bliss... This is ATM situated in the\noutskirts of the city. Our plan is... l'm scared. Scare isn't as fearsome as you fear. Even imagination isn't\nas beautiful as imagined. Do you want mother or not?\n- l want. Then, don't think about this matter. Tomorrow night we're\nexecuting the plan. What?\n- Nothing. Your nothing says there is something. What happened? l'm confused that's why l've called\nyou who understands me well. l think you'll suggest a solution. First think what is to happen immediate. We can think about future later. l love a girl, her name is Snigdha, l could always see the love\nin her eyes whenever l saw, but always avoided her sweetly, the love which l hid secretly from\nher today united me with her. Time which made you do bad things\nthough you wanted to go good, it's going to change your life\nfor good with a good thing. Everything will be fine for you.\nDon't worry. Didn't Snigdha come to office today? She quit the job. l must say that. She'll not even have lunch\nwithout informing you, would she quit without your knowledge? l'm asking you seriously,\ntell me the truth. Her marriage is fixed,\nnext week she's getting married. Let's meet in Coffee Day\ntoday evening, l'm busy now. Please don't mind. Don't ask me what, why and how? l've agreed to marry wholeheartedly. Then, that day... l love you. l wanted that love for all my life. You said no when l proposed. When l thought over it again,\nl felt we may not get on well. Unfulfilled desires will come as dreams. What happened between us that night\nis also one such dream. Like wise, missed something in life,\nlost something in life, l don't have any such sad feelings. The moments spent with you are... Don't tell me anything. l can't say anything more than this. My would be husband is\nwaiting outside. Has your heart lost?\nls it left with sorrows only? Moonlight has vanished,\ndarkness has taken over... Can't you see the path? The tear has crossed the barrier\nof eyes and flowing like sea... What's all this? What happened that night\nwasn't his wish but my wish. l know his life ambition. l don't want to become a hurdle to it. That's why l was harsh\nto make him hate me. What are you saying? Yes... My life with him also like that. Can't you tell him the truth then? Please don't tell him anything.\nl'm not sad for being left alone. My love is success. l can live all my life happily\nwith his memories. Which union will show that love isn't\nalways one that breaks hearts? Which bond will show that\nlove is alive and kicking? A life long love has slipped from hands... ls your magic this much only? How did you come in?\n- Door was open. Where is Michael? Doctor said mother needs\nto be operated in 2 days, l need Rs.6 lakhs,\nl wanted to ask you, but you were also in problems, Michael too needed Rs.6 lakhs, both needed Rs.12 lakhs,\nhe suggested robbing bank, l thought over it,\nhad no other option, l couldn't avoid for mother's sake,\nl said okay, everything went as we had planned,\nbut after the robbery... What are you saying? ATM in city outskirt industrial\narea was robbed, sorry, l came to the point directly, right?\nThat's my style. Don't you've the habit of\nanswering phone calls? Why do you have a phone then? Your visiting card has\nyour phone number too. l found this card in the purse and\nthe purse was found in the spot. That purse... Purse is not mine but tension\nwill be there, right? Where can l find the man\nin this photo? Who is he? Don't you know him?\nl too don't know him. Anyway what's the thrill if you\nget easily what you search? Must search, hunt and catch,\nthat will be great thrill. Right? Let's catch him. l need little information,\nshall we go in and talk? Please go ahead here only. My cell battery charge is down. lf you give me your charger,\nlet's discuss as cell gets charged. Shall we go in? l don't have Nokia phone. Okay, l didn't get my pen\nto note down information, if you give me pen and paper,\nlet's discuss and l'll take down. l don't have a pen. Now what l'm going to ask,\nyou can't say you don't have it, because l want water to drink. l'll bring. lf i take anything from anyone,\nl'll always return it. Now l'm drinking water, right?\nl'll make you drink later. Enough. Bye. You wanted to ask some information. l didn't say l'll ask information,\nl said l want information. l got it. What l plucked tonight, you to whom l'll report, and\nthe man who l'll catch tomorrow, l'll tell by tomorrow morning\nto both of you at a time. You feel like you've seen me, right? The purse is mine. Keep it with you. To give you information\nabout the robbery. Can't believe it, right? Believe you but l feel a case\nmust be traced, chased, it must give me thrill! You dampened my thrill. You'll not miss your thrill. Shall we go? He was the one who robbed! There only! Hey you...you ! Where are you? Now...l'm on the way to Singapore. Must meet you.\n- Okay, come to Wall Street. Like to have beer? You're going away, right? Sure! You're going to Singapore, right?\nFor this trivial thing. Anyways you're damn lucky man ! But you must never forget friends. Did l say anything wrong? Shall we change the topic?\nToday is my last day, right? Change the topic, your last day, right? You, me and Chandu, l miss our gang. Poor Chandu, how would he be now? Did you say good bye to him? l called him, but not reachable. Where are you Chandu?\nCome to Wall Street immediately. Michael is going away, right? Come quickly. He will come. l'm getting late to my flight.\nl'll go now. As soon Chandu comes,\nwe'll come to the airport. You made a mistake,\nyou misunderstood it. Living lavishly doesn't\nmean by cheating your friend. What really had happened, Kranthi? Time is not good. Not the time, tyre is not good, idiot. Do something. Am a mechanic, bloody fool?\nAm l not checking it, idiot? Get in. You're always trouble. Are you happy?\n- What happy? What happened? The count says we've just 7 only! l thought problem is solved\nbut puzzle has begun. Tell me, what shall we do now? l need Rs.6 lakhs for\noperation, right? - Okay, you tell me. You keep a lakh and\ngive me the balance. You want it for your mother, right? Please, l'll be grateful\nto you all my life. Since how long mother is bedridden?\n- Since 5 years. ls there any guaranty that\noperation will cure mother? How can l guaranty? lf you give me Rs.6 lakhs,\nl'll surely settle down in life. Chance comes only once, if l give up for your feelings,\nif l don't go to Singapore, l don't know all that. l did this for my mother,\nhow can you change after doing this? Yes, l told them to load\nthis much money only. That's my opinion only. l'll repay you somehow after\nmother's operation. How can you?\nYou couldn't arrange Rs.50000. l beg you ! Whether you beg or hold my collar,\nmoney is important to me. Get lost man ! This is unfair! Please stop! Don't feel so much, think over it.\nWhat's wrong in what l said? Take one lakh and\nconduct funeral ceremony. l robbed the bank for my mother, l can kill you also to\nsave my mother. Stop bloody bastard! Stop...give me the bag! Hey, stop there! You've changed me with\nyour love for mother. Go and save your mother. l was harsh in anger.\nPlease don't mind. My mother! My mother!\nMother... A betrayer won't listen\nto a living man, how can he hear a dead man's cries? l wouldn't have believed it. Not only that nobody would believe\nif l say this had happened. Truth has no connection\nwith trusts. Shall l tell the truth? How a betrayer of friendship appears,\none who does justice also looks same? Shall l tell what is trust? The friend who rendered justice! The justice isn't complete,\nthere's little more to do. My name is Kranthi, please start\nthe operation of Chandu's mother. l'm coming with money. After some time... How could you hide so much love? Chandu told me everything. Where is Chandu?\n- Come, l'll tell you. Michael used to say mother is\nGod given mother to him. To tell the truth, Kranthi is\nthe real son of my mother. lf l've another birth,\nl must be born again as her son. Repay the gratitude! l'll take leave now. Avarice, selfishness and lust\nare the real demons in us, if we don't kill it, those demons will come out\nand kill us, from your Anil Gopireddy", "68y_ujCryHQ": "yo everybody what's up what's up our

like that ain't on here that's cool people is Minute Maid they're from Michigan wonderful guys yeah let's let's rip is down see what happens we got it the church down there", "9x95J3ljQ54": "hey guys this is a super quick tutorial on how to rectify the center pin issue with ego type batteries now what happens is this little bit here this pillar that's what makes connection to this in the middle of the cart or your attic whatever now when you use different sized car toes and outies you will end up screwing down woodenly needs go off and see that's actually connected and if you can hear that that's firing but oftentimes will just get screwed down one you mean - so when you unscrew your center pins actually push down a little in the middle so that bit gets crushed the arty has free movement up and down the little bit in there so sorry about the background noise that's just my daughter doing some cooking you can't cheat at any if you saw the way I did that you just tease it up litchi I'm just using a little Christmas cracker screwdriver poke it in one side give it a little left poking yeah we're giving it a little lift to make it even welcome to the learning book there we go so that should just once again fire absolutely find so literally it's just the case of popping that little center pin just sliding it up and you just gotta be a little bit careful because apparently you can break the connection so if you can tease the center pin up from a bratty you're using apparently it's best to try and do it on that first personally I find it quite hard to do on these ones so I usually just end up a little bit up on here so there you go if you have any problems anything just isn't firing but other stuff is working you got any go type connector or center pin arrangement then it's most likely that all right good luck have a good one knows", "4Li0QVGk1JY": "hey everyone's tech crazy today's video is going to be review on day shift by kingsway i will show you in another video um what i got i rolled a joint a bit already it's a really good tasting smells it smells kind of off but i think it dried out in the package i already smoked a little bit i gave some of my friend out of the half quarter i got it was under 20 bucks it was a really cheap strain um i think it was like 18 bucks for 19 bucks for tax but the flavor is just amazing it's a really nice stream my friend said that it was one of the best strains he had tasted from the dispensaries and uh that goes a long way of saying you know he's tried a lot of different strengths so reminds me of smarties it's got a little bit of a taste of like smarties i don't know even the aftertaste tastes like smarties it's smooth but if you take a big pull it's going to make a cough because it is potent it's a nice potent strain it's burning really good i'll show you i'll show you the buds and all that at the end of this part of the video i'll show you the packaging and all that um definitely one of the most tasty strains you can get i really like king's way it's by king's way um they got the night shift as well i did a video on that that was a very nice strain to smoke um so was this one kingsways by far one of the best uh and get weed from i think just because they're quality it's definitely a treat once in a while to get a pack from them all i can taste is smarties that's all i can think of is just the taste of smarties it's still pretty early so i think i'm done smoking this smoke i have a joint it's good enough for me morning time i got some stuff to do so um it's a day shift so i imagine i should be good all day maybe i'll smoke this in four or five hours the other half overall for the price quality the bug was completely dry it didn't have much of a smell but when you break it up it smells amazing and when you smoke it it tastes amazing the only thing i could say is the bud was dry but i think i think i got a discount on when i bought it just because the it was dry so overall i probably would say this is a five star stream but overall i'm gonna give it a 4.8 just because it was so dry the count looked a little bit small i think it dried out didn't have a humidity pack maybe if i had a medium pack it would stink better yeah overall 4.8 really nice uh great daytime smoke so uh thanks for watching until the next one you", "Hn7IZwHYC_w": "this video is to show you how to fix your cartomizer connection to your battery usually if you're hitting the button and nothing's happening at all this is the problem there's a connection point at the bottom of the cartomizer sometimes when you push it against the battery the piece gets stuck down so you just need to free it up a little and then then that causes a better connection all you need to do is take a tool any tool with a pointy edge really if you use a toothpick break off the tip so it doesn't get stuck inside you go right on the edge and just push it push it towards the center a little push it towards the center maybe a tiny lift but don't pull it because it'll come out and it'll be ruined so just kind of push it to the side like this push it to the side like that and that frees it up that if that doesn't free it up you just kind of push it and pull it up a tiny bit just a tiny bit like that depends are the same thing if your pen isn't working it's getting stuck you just push that piece right towards the middle anything with a pointy edge even this dull piece works to fix it thanks for watching", "Dg4if0UpGo8": "now a KXAN news in-depth report it's one of the most powerful weapons local schools have to catch children doing drugs drug dogs can sniff lockers and cars even backpacks and purses without a reason it's all free game as long as students are not wearing them a mother though is now questioning the effectiveness of those dogs after her daughter was singled out kxan erin cargile has been digging into the story for months trying to figure out just how useful the canines are easy easy Krakow is ready good boy hey go hip-hop chica the mission sniff out drugs the place the student parking lot at Anderson high school he's more accurate than any scientific equipment out there he and his handler Austin ISD police officer Tony Andrew check the cars huh okay then move inside look trying to find the five cents this golden retriever is trained to detect meth heroin cocaine marijuana and gunpowder seats the search doesn't turn up anything but the district says it's drug sniffing dogs are successful more than half the time not surprising to Bowie high school sophomore and an amber C know so what did you say drugs are a problem in at your high school yeah probably half the school does it the 16 year old wanted to surprise her boyfriend with homemade brownies the chocolate never made a pass first period during a random classroom search drug dogs picked up on a scent officers thought was pot and they were like are these your brownies and I was like yeah they are my brownies and they said did you do anything special to these brownies and I was like no ana says she was taken to the office and questioned by school police who called and his mother she was just totally frightened and they had asked her questions like do you do drugs does anybody at your home do drugs I tried to tell the policeman I said well what dog would go for the brownies and so he said no these dogs are trained and there's no way that they would ever be attracted to the chocolate police sent the brownies to the lab for testing but as far as Anna's mother was concerned the damage had been done you can get on Facebook and ruin a kid's reputation and nothing flat by you know talking about them and I think that it's irresponsible and hurtful to take a child a policeman to take a child out of a classroom and you don't even know if that child is guilty or innocent I had some people that were like wow and it's a STONER I didn't know that about her I was like oh I'm not I'm a good person Phyllis after two and a half months the results were in turns out the brownies were drug free yeah I mean it's like tell me something I don't know I'd much rather see a social worker in in school than a dog walking the halls we wanted to know just how useful are they according to a ISD last school year the canines made 211 trips to campuses and detected drugs 138 times so far this year the dogs have made 66 campus visits and found drugs 38 times I think it's a very effective tool because all the stuff my dog has found wouldn't have been found if we he wasn't in school officer Andrew says the brownie situation is extremely unusual sometimes dogs have bad days and that that day a dog had a bad day we identify that as an issue and that will be fixed now Rocco is one of two AISD drug dogs at one time they had five but have had to retire a couple recently due to medical issues and they're not cheap a drug dog can cost the district between seven and ten thousand dollars that includes sending the officer off for training with the dog now other local school districts that don't have their own Police Department call on help from other agencies with drug dogs Erin

concentrate vaporizer from improve actually not a concentrate vaporizer as much as an on-the-go dabber the dipstick is an electric straw I liked your connector collector so to speak you inhale there and you dab in their magnetic cap to keep everything clean first thing you want to do take that cap off unscrew the stem get your batteries once they're fully charged take this off and put them in positive first now these are not triple-a batteries these are IR c10 440 batteries there are 3.7 volts we're running seven point four volts now when you put the batteries in you'll know if they're in correctly because it's the blue light will flash just give that a little twist on and it is magnetic the cap stays right on now to use the dipstick couldn't be easier I do is take off the magnetic lid get your concentrates gonna get some shatter here do you turn it on I'll clicks light flashes hold the button coil glows red to use the dipstick simply push the button till the coil gloves dip it it now the dipstick won't replace your portable or your digital email at home but if you do have one and you are heavily into concentrates the dipstick is the next best thing to do dabs on the go all you need is your consecrate container and your dipstick simple as this you can regulate the other the length you draw it has about an 8 to 10 second shutoff time if you hold the button in so you can take a nice little tie dad or you can take a really long slow draw a DAB the dipstick works amazingly well is the dog to turn the unit off five clicks turns it off safety feature for the button and when you're all done just look at the magnetic cap on comes with a lanyard you can put it around your neck take it everywhere you go my favorite product so far that's come out this year is the dipstick I love doing the ABS and when I want to go I take the dipstick so pretty much I use it daily and I just have nothing about great things to say about it so far you can buy extra coils dipstick Ulta offers replacement batteries and like the little silicon tips and still stainless steel tube and the dipstick does come with two concentrate showers you if you have your own you can go ahead and just dip right out of that or you can fill up one of the supplied concentrate jars let's get one more shot here take that off push button amazing tastes amazingly smooth the dipstick is a super innovative product there's nothing like it on the market there's nothing to compare to it takes all the hassle away from doing dabs on the go all you need is concentrate container and your dipstick you're good to go so anybody that has and even now anybody that's really really into concentrates I would absolutely check into the dipstick and yeah I absolutely recommend it to anyone anyone in the constant race anybody likes concentrates check out the dipstick all right guys that's my review thanks for watching [Music]", "6thfo9pXVeA": "I thought I'd make a little video I'm a vapor cigarette sometimes it don't work so I just figured I'd make a little video on simple what I do when it doesn't work first thing that realizes the sequence of when you plug into the battery charger seems to be important I plug everything up all at once you see I get a green light say my paper cigarette is fully charged and I get no blue LED light but when I'd take and plug the charger in first then last screw in my vapor cigarette I get a red light and I get an LED light saying it's charging so sometimes the sequence I put it on the charger affects it on whether it's gonna charge on that charge as you see I got no LED light unscrew this thing for cigarette then screw it back in I get a red shining light and I get a blue LED light okay another times when it won't work I'll pull the mouthpiece off inspect it make sure it isn't gummed up there isn't any debris buildup and I'll clean that off all real good then I'll pull the heater element off and I'll look at it inspect it clean it run it under hot water force water through the tubes clean it all up wipe down the inside of it with a q-tip dry it out real good blow through it and then I my battery it's at the top of this kissing sometimes gunk will build up right here just take that wipe it all out clean it up make sure you get the threads all nice and clean I believe that's where the heating element gets it's like electricity so if you don't have a good clean connection you're not gonna get a good vapor so clean it all add up clean the threads all up on both pieces and this is what I do and have it seems to work fine hope this video was

much from four different companies that uh I really just have no clue what I got looks like I got a lot of carts here here's one of those slim bake pins this is the Dreamsicle I really wanted to try this one I heard through the grapevine that the Dreamsicle was really good kind of like the sunset sherbert you know real similar it's gonna try this out we also got a [ __ ] time a co2 extracted vape oils which as we all know in case you don't know the co2 extracted oils are thicker and a little bit more like takes a little bit more time to burn through the oil and to me they generally have like a little bit stronger flavor the co2 extracted compared to like the distillate or other kind of broke down oils alcohol-based I really do like these uh these um like their version of the C cell you know like their slim vape pens they you know they always got a good flavor to them beautiful beautiful aroma the only downside is is you know just like any other disposable pen they just they don't last very long especially no it's something like me who smokes or shirt on I was tweeting yesterday I'd I just ran it I like smoking my last bowl like God you know it's sad when you get to that last bowl

would I not be able to buy it that's weird yeah I'm gonna have to talk to my daughter about let me know if you guys have had that trouble with them telling you they couldn't sell you a CBD product when you're on like the highest level of THC there is all right so the Dreamsicle it's really really really really really mild like it's almost like you're just smoking favor there's like

the um sativa is read the bottle is clear read and the indica is clear blue now I wish Cresco would put more information about these strains because I try to look this up and I found some information on the Girl Scout cookies which this is Girl Scout cookies but they renamed that Cresskill cookies but it's not found some information on the old name on it but I didn't find much information on the no.1 and I didn't find information on their website so Cresco if you see this video please put some information like the other manufactures or the other producers about distrain the prospective

these before and what I noticed sometimes - with that they don't hold a good seal and you can smell it out the package or the shake will get on the outside the room here but maybe that was just you know a bottle three specimens that was just one or two by yeah you definitely I could smell it out the bottle yeah so it's not airtight this one doesn't have much Akif there but the other ones I seen that had key fall on the outside here which is not good some of them are the shake ones oh wow that's weird it's like um it's like a spicy ash flavor and it looks kind of purplish on the video I

see that it's hard to see that in person though it just looks very dark but here Wow look at that you can see all the Keef on it too like whoa that's not good you see how the key flick right here on the purple all right see this one this one is green and this one here see if I could point that if that one right there yeah see those are purple there and then those soya green I don't know what's up with that definitely got a lot of Keef on there it comes in at 20% THC does like it would be more the definite this is not a pungent smell or nothing like that you know it's not something that just smell right away it's more like an incense type of smell or like a spices type of smell how much do we got let's see come on Crisco no right under find that maybe unspecial between on sale between 45 to 55 depending where you go test out a gram see what we get here I do the purple one I don't know if it matters or not but let's try the purple its definitely dry crispy okay maybe that's why they put I noticed all of them have this on the crest go bottles so maybe they put it to keep it dry to a certain to the 50 degree 50% humidity these are supposed to once they're hard they're they need to be replaced or they're no good this one feels a bit hard in there but it still feels a bit wet okay let's see I'm pretty sure it's gonna crush it did make questions huh Alma held a crush but stay together it's got some crush but it's staying to God it's pretty dense see yeah it's got some punch some crush there's still face and Uggs now that I break it up it has a little bit of a like a cushy smell to see let's see how much keep would get out of bear with me on the Camry guys I'm learning and then it's a process oh come on man don't send me I just pushed it down [Music] hey this one also it looks like it's gonna get a lot of Keith but I've been wrong before so we'll just have to wait and see but it just feels like it just dry enough it's crunchy this thick it's got a lot of Keef on it just sitting on it see it's got a little yellow round ball gonna sift that out I'm gonna posit here and we'll come back and see how much so this is the last of it first sometimes you could see through the screen there see in the inside but you can't see much it's got a cushy on the tongue smell which is attracted me to it I didn't like the spicy smell but the UM it's got a cushy undertone so I'm guessing when you smoking it you're gonna taste that pushy undertone is it taste good oh yeah nice not a lot lot but nice for a grant that maybe like point one so it's about 110 percent oh yeah it's only about point zero five you can see there it's only about point zero five point zero six it took that save that to the side that's what's good about having that grinder you can save the kief if you want make yourself a little pod a little puck I mean or save it or you know cook it or you can just put it right back into what you're rolling if you want three five this is I mentioned in the video two things that you want to get this is another thing as well there's like a bowl or a plate is another essential or like a rolling trays or a rolling plate or even just you see what I'm using at the moment nothing special eventually I'm gonna get a tray but for the moment I've been using this and it just makes stuff easier it's easier to pour easier to put back okay so this makes the fat this scale is sometimes kind of off but looks like this makes a fat J at point three so we're gonna be without that it may swish down I think it's gonna squish down like like other stuff I've had but if I can roll it J with gloves on you can roll a J period for those of you who can't or think you can't you gotta that's why I say use a grinder because everything comes out even and it's easier to roll as well it's easier to put in your bowl back your bowl evenly I may have to lick it this is what a plate or the ball comes in handy tool okay when you're rolling you see I'm dropping stuff on the table here put your bowl right on there what's your rolling and whatever you drop goes back for the next batch whenever you're ready again well you can stuff it into the end there make sure everything is even you don't want it I licked it too much there you don't want to look too much because you're gonna rip that paper so you can see what gloves it's not the prettiest but it definitely will do the job and it holds up alright so let's try this bad boy on let's see wow that's weird it's got like a berry like that cushy berry flavor but I didn't get that smell I got like a cushy smell but I didn't get like a bear it's kind of a berry cush flavor definitely you know it doesn't smell like what it smells like initially like when I first smelled it it's not like something with spices does seem like a smoother smoke it keeps turning off and it was kind of hard to hit at first so that maybe um I didn't put enough in there or I rolled it too tight it doesn't seem like it's oh yeah it's kind of tight okay so you may 1.35 in there and you don't stretch it out a little bit more or just open it up and don't make it so tight nice two thumbs up for me again another nice strain so you guys have a great day I hope you're having a good day already mine was okay now it's gonna be a lot better", "2uHhQxD-5Sg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "tOEDV6xeSfM": "my vape pen won't work hit or cedar

right and just when i was starting to get low uh fresh wrecked round true leave came by and uh i now have some of this uh black tuna so i managed to not destroy the label cleaning it let's see if it'll [ __ ] focus there we go 26 percent this is gonna be like a you know but imagine it's a sativa leaning hybrid yeah really been looking forward to trying this one i've heard some good reviews so so far it looks like really pretty buds i can oh wow okay so the smell coming out of there is glorious it has a real old school just dank smell uh oh sweet sour pungent oh oh i could tell i like this one cure wow it's not dry i like it let's see what it weighs this stuff's 58 and eight of course i use some true lever points so i got a little cheaper than that it's the most expensive strain you get it truly so ah [ __ ] i got another one i got two of them let's go ahead and open up this other one just try to keep those nugs over there okay pretty similar these look a little smaller than the others but it has decent bag appeal i mean they're they're pretty they definitely hook it up on this more expensive stuff it looks like i mean the last one was 3.75 that was cool oh [ __ ] looks like i got a fat tuna oh [ __ ] yeah that's always nice well i'm going to immediately twist one up and i'll put something in the description uh after i've smoked it thanks a lot", "IX5dj0SfQDQ": "well it's time to do another video here and um unfortunately the mailman hasn't arrived yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one", "_2jiFk0ifFI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nug Smasher comm

"w1jdfDP20Ac": "what's good YouTube yeah I'm Kelli and this is torches torches in your lighters if you need them and that's the ninjas today we have some og crumble there's no label on it I took the sticker off who cares you know I put in the link in the description below who this is from I don't really know off the bat so yeah it's coming across dark on the camera but it's like the peanut butter consistency I used to get from a different shop like it looks super super soft and almost wet but then when you go to touch it it just kind of yeah I really love a good OG so lady that's what I've been dabbing on you know just a good OG like I don't really want anything else like you know you bring you someone with some really good flavors you know like from the Bay Area you know then then we could talk but aside from that you know just bring me a real good og not function on that all day you know there's a couple strains that I really really [ __ ] with but at the end of the day it's just too hard to get ahold of on like an everyday basis or just you know they're you know like if I was in love with strains like Green crack blue dream it would be nothing to find those strains on almost everybody's name you know even just a regular OG I mean most dispensaries nowadays have at least over one good Oh G on their menu it may be you know you know pricey because you know people like the oh geez but you know cheers y'all some of that og crumble one of the more smoother oh jeez I've ever smoked as far as crumble goes you know it has everything that you love about an OG as far as the flavor but it's just not really um it's like a lot of times when you smoke a good OG you get that taste and you know you can taste it on the exhale this is more like you don't taste it on the exhale it just kind of like is a aftertaste you know the exhale is just nice and smooth the inhale is nice and smooth yeah the flavor just stays with you as opposed to you know when you exhale it you know you feel it you taste it on the way out I'm not trying to make this video too long but I didn't have something to talk about as far as the high times you know I I really wasn't feeling what the way MIT did you know like I said I'm sure you know you've probably heard all the comments that were made about it and you know they were essentially all my my same argument points you know was like you know of course they're high and you know you know the big the biggest argument that I think I can make is that like I said you know I lived in Georgia for a minute you know for like two years you know after got a high school and [ __ ] like that and around that time this is like what 2005 and stuff like that you know they didn't have too much good [ __ ] to smoke on you know you know I had a couple homies out there or meant a couple homies out there and you know they tried to introduce me to some fire and you know what they believed to be fire and I mean it just couldn't compare even system like you know mids out here you know and I'm not trying to bash them but I'm I say that to say that the end of the day if he stays if if he's you know he's from New Orleans and stuff he's from the south and stuff you know maybe they don't maybe he just doesn't have access to the fire fire [ __ ] you know and obviously you know he's got a bunch of money but Allah I'm saying is you know he may have all the money and whatnot but unless he's into some illegal [ __ ] as far as having it flown over the states that are illegal to smoke at or whatever and you know obviously you know I'm gonna do it they're gonna do so if that's the case then more power to him but let's say that's not the case let's say you know comes back off the road you know maybe he has some fire on him from you know from the road but let's say that [ __ ] runs out you know he's just chillin at the pad you know just doing local stuff or whatever you know and he wants to pick up some fire like who's got the fire out there you know like they're you know and then their best example of fire may not be super strong so I let alone dabs you know like like I told you I told you guys before just I mean there's there's a there's a nice amount of people Africa nice amount of african-american people that that dab and stuff like that that are with it and everything but there is a large large large group of people that you know are strictly with that flower and I mean whether it's African American whatever I mean there's it's like there's a divide between the people that smoke flower and then the people that dad you know like there are some people that do the gamut like that smoke all of it they don't really give a [ __ ] like myself but it just seems like they're starting to become like somewhat of a divide between those that dab and those that smoke flower like the two are not one in the same you know and you know here's what it is you know let me know how you feel about that in the comment box you know do you have any people that you smoked with or you used to smoke with that maybe you know once you started dabbing you know maybe they weren't all - with it and you just kind of we're doing the dad and all on your own and I mean maybe they came around maybe they didn't you know maybe it just is what it is you know some people don't understand it you know I can sit here and talk all day about what it is where it comes from and everything but like I said before earlier videos you know all these videos are out there if you really want to know what you know where it comes from and also this [ __ ] you know you can look it up you know it's there for you that's how I learned you know ain't nobody gonna just tell you to [ __ ] you know you know some people act like it's like some coveted secret on how to grow weed sometimes like it's not really a big secret but there's like little things that people try to you know keep back for themselves like the you know there's secret recipes and stuff like that but the general gist of growing weed is very simple very simple okay I'm at nine minutes look simple simple simple breakdown you know you 18 hours of light 16 6 hours of dark during the vegetative state you need 12 hours of light 12 hours of dark during the flower stage this is just this is my little two cents in the whole situation when transitioning there's a zero week when it comes to flowering so when a lot of growers are like yeah I put it under there it's been in there a week it's not really doing anything understand that's like the transition week you know it really doesn't do anything it starts to throw the pistils little white hairs and stuff like that but it really is not doing too much you know that's zero week you know so you count from zero week to the nine or the ten weeks or eight weeks or whatever it is you know or you could eyeball it you'll use the mic magnifier however you do it Jojo you know the lights you use for your vegetative cycle the lights you use for your flower cycle it's all up to you there's all kind of variations out there I found and I'm sure many of us out there will agree you know you do what you can afford not so much what you think is you know what you know the big you know bigger company is oh that they're doing this or they're using high-pressure starting today they're not you know you do what you can you can afford cuz you know not all of us can afford like a 16 like you know all high pressure sodium you know thousand watt light grow room or whatever it's in terms of the bill you know but you know if you can afford it then a do what the [ __ ] you want to do you know you're gonna need to pick a good medium you know you could use the soil you go to Hyderabad you could do you know there's there's so many ways you know there's there's so many ways out there and I mean it depends on how technically you want to get with it you know I'm personally just once people that likes to keep it fairly basic you know I don't know no huge stunts pulled on my end and yeah you know people will get on me about the using of nutrients and stuff like that but you know it's what I it's what I know so you know it just is what it is I don't hit on anybody doing whatever the hell they're doing you know just from its what worked for me you know so when I get back to going you know obviously you know creature of habit I'm probably going to end up getting back to the same habits but you know if I can find a more organic way of doing things but still getting the same results if not better then yeah you know I'm interested in changing up but um as far as anything else goes you know 101 you know you want to flush whatever the hell you put into it even if it is an organic solution you're gonna want to flush it towards the end you know just to clean it out leach it of anything so it could just be the product that we're getting out of it you know you know you want to slow slow hang dried all that [ __ ] you don't want to rush that [ __ ] you know no heat you know you don't want to do anything extra to it you know yeah let it let your plants go full term it's the biggest is the biggest thing you know I know I know how eager you're gonna want to be towards the very end to just be like [ __ ] I want to pull it because it just looks so beautiful it's juicing those buds just like ah no I just let it go a few more days you know just you know say a battle of willpower when it comes today you know like so yeah you know and the more plants to marry her you know just you know grow as many as you can you know like if just like the old school rules back in the day people would be like oh you can only grow six plants so then where we do instead of growing you know six just little plants we grew six is the biggest [ __ ] that we could grow you know what I mean like take the rules and you work within the confines of what you got going on they're like 99 plants okay 99 plants 99 the biggest [ __ ] you could go right you know um some people would tell you you know they gotta get their grows out really quick so they wanna do like maybe like three months max of four to get them out but sometimes you know like I said if you wait the the law a little bit longer you know you might get you know you know more for your dollar at the end of it you know if you go to month veg those plant those veg those vintage plants are gonna be a lot bigger and you're gonna have a lot more notes of places for buds to shoot off of you're gonna need a lot more right to flower them you know you might need some lights for underneath and stuff like that but it'll be well more worth your time to [ __ ] with plants of those size of that size then plants of like one month then you know for weeks you know depending on the type of lights you have hitting on them and how fast they're visually you know so yeah that's you know my general breakdown of growing you know you know anything else it's just stuff that can be you know I could I could tell you my preference but then it's like there would be a million other you know so I mean realistically you fill in the blanks you know like what kind of grow you trying to do and also stuff like that like it's all up to you you know but this is exactly why I say I don't really bother to talk about that stuff not that I don't know anything about that stuff you know but it's you know like the whole reason I'm on here what you know with the YouTube thing is because I watched those videos I've seen people you know do the grow videos and I've seen people show their grows you know like there's a lot of people like that are in my channel list that I still watch very frequently and it just like the only thing about it now is that I can't grow so therefore I don't really wants to edge it you know like I don't want to see what's his name what's his name the top of my head he's in he's in my channel this man but he's got he's got the um this huge bro you know operation going on and it's super clean you know and you know you know to be honest you get jealous and you're like I really wanted Oakland I want to grow something I want to you know do something but I can't in my current circumstances so is what it is and that's upsetting you know like to have the knowledge to do something or the ability to do something and then you're just like ah like I can't do nothing about it so anyways I think we did three dabs already so might as well get about unless maybe maybe we'll do one from this little piece right here you know this little cup I got at the at the High Times event you know I would I wouldn't have a video of that but I really didn't catch too much footage or tape or whatever because as soon as I walked in the gate that's when my phone decided to die I went back down to the car at some point and I charged it up for a while and I caught a few little things but it's just it's just not worthy of anything so I just said [ __ ] it you know I'm just gonna enjoy myself on there and you know I had a decent time hung out you know I said picked up this little piece ten dollars ten dollars and Dada the inside is not perfect as far as where it meets up with the cup the straw it's up with the cup it's like uneven the hole is not quite one big circle but well I don't really care it's just something to have something smoke out of it hits so yeah let's do that one time we're gonna fight again everybody's been having a good week chillin give them good abs in you know smokings whatever you're smoking on you know I said well our two it's just not as often since I started smoking you know doing the dabs people say okay well why'd you give up on the other thing the main reason is I mean it's kind of obvious you know if you [ __ ] with deliveries or if that's what you you know if that's what you have to [ __ ] with then you understand that usually they're only gonna deliver for an eighth but they don't even offer the gram as it as an option so you have to buy anything so you get used to buying an eighth at let's say 35 to like $50 and you know if you smoke on average let's say 1/8 every four days right like let's say two to four days you know if that's the case now if it's if it cost you the same amount for a gram and you know if you smoke you know a gram backs you know relatively it safe it takes you to the same time to smoke a gram of wax and the same time that it does you to smoke that eighth then yeah you like I can't do both you know I figure [ __ ] I just do one or the other so yeah that's exactly why I like it's not a choice to say [ __ ] the flower but you know this gets me higher this is this does the trick this almost every hit makes me feel like the first time I got high you know like I can feel it every time but cheers y'all and that's from just that a little little bit of color you'll see it size difference so anyways hope you enjoyed the video if you did make sure you hit that like button if you want to see more make sure you hit that subscribe button as usual I'm Cali and this has been Dad more cat", "VLSDpPmdVFI": "one two three come on sacred lotus [Music] what is sacred lotus the

"pn61WF5oEvk": "[Music] thank you this gosh well look first of all you've got a mask because we're still in the height of coronavirus so I'm just gonna pop this on keep safe you guys just gonna pop it here for now there aren't any there's no one around me right now so you can actually see what I'm saying and then look I will that might come in handy don't leave that one in the booth look you just clip it in like this pull these back and then boom on it goes the reason for that is because it's easier to get in and out why there are no doors on this baby look at it no roof no doors this is the fastest ever Road legal notice and this is called get ready for it there are lots of numbers here the 311 4:30 hang on [Music] I can't eat it would be crazy for the Swede next mean 311 like this here 311 they originally made 311 of these cars but this version is the 430 version and they've only made 20 of this version so this is a very special version it's called final evolution so only 20 of these and I'm currently in Dubai this is the only one in the whole region it's also the only one to be in black and gold now lotus fans out there will know why it's in black and gold because it refers to the f1 colours so f1 in its heyday black and gold this is a very special livery on this car this is all the Bhoots space you get with this car right here and it's right next to the engine so this space is very hot so you don't want to keep your cool beers or anything in there actually it's probably not very useful at all this space but that's all you've got and then right here we're looking at what we're working with this is a 3.5 liter v6 supercharged it's actually a Toyota engine we're gonna have a little bit of a feel for this baby it is actually really quick 3.2 seconds 0 to 100 now you guys know I used to own a Lamborghini Huracan her name was Lucy that's exactly the same speed 0 to 100 they've made it as light as possible no roof no doors that's gonna be interesting to get into in just a second we'll see how that goes not the most elegant way to get into a car I've been practicing over the years though so we'll have to see how that goes I've got my pants on don't wear a skirt or a dress if you're gonna drive this car okay okay so you just put these on all right now if you're familiar with the 311 that came out first the difference between that car and this one this is the 430 version is it has more horsepower got 430 horsepower it's got a bigger rear wing look at this beauty we know it's going to go fast it's so big and it actually sits higher so that's creating more downforce it's also got a extended front lip as well yeah this car only weighs just over 900 kilos that may not mean much to but think about a motorbike it's like four motorbikes that's it the Lamborghini Huracan weighs one and a half tonnes this way is just over 900 kilos all of this is carbon body complete carbon body look you can see it here some of this is exposed to you the carbon and then some of it's painted over so you've got this beautiful line here in between you've got the Union Jack here in the side indicators it's all handmade in England you've got ultra lightweight forged aluminium wheels and what I think is an interesting feature is this little rearview mirror poking up in the middle of nowhere before but I suppose there's nowhere else you could really put it because there's no roof on the car so you've got that there and you've got these carbon-fiber bucket seats racing seats with the racing belts and it is a manual 6-speed manual so gonna try this baby out should we just get in push that button down and pull this yeah see these aren't the best choice today of shoes look at these spikes and look at this beautiful carbon body spikes karma buddy it doesn't really go so I'm gonna not touch it in any way shape or form with my feet yes I think the more you do it the more practice you get the better you'll get out that um that wasn't too bad okay we'll pop this back on it's super super simple just line it up like this boom on it goes in here to go so racing seatbelts look there's nothing protecting my face so it is actually legal to drive this way without a helmet you can just drive it as is but if you're gonna get up any speed you've literally got stuff flying at you from the road so it would be safer to wear a helmet I don't have one today I'm not I'm not gonna be able to get up with that much speed we've actually got to keep the mileage low because it's super-new this car this cars for sale for just over 150 thousand dollars so I'm going to be very careful with it this is how you get into a safety harness seat belt and the reason it's in here is because this car is made for the track but it is road legal which is cool there you go this C is actually optional so you can get this car with just the driver's seat that's it if you want to seriously strip it down and save even more weight the bucket seat for the passenger out the window doesn't have any windows just but for me I actually can't like the second seat and I thought I'd bring along a special passenger today names Fred no one else is game enough to drive with me Fred you ready to go mate Fred don't upside-down Freight jump in mate come on we'll go for a bit of a spin that'll brighten your day don't be scared all right strap in safety first put your seatbelts on guys let's start her up the cool thing about this car is look you've got this digital display here and it does all sorts of cool stuff so I'm just gonna pull this seat forward it is a manual so clutch in okay this is the key pretty basic key just an open lock button and that's it this one goes in alright and then you turn this this pops up and this engine start button over here lights up all right I can show you the display first with this little button here see there on the side look at how many different displays you can choose from not one that's alright that's nice simple see everything you need to race version then you've got this one that look at all of these I've never seen so many and then check this one out this will confuse the hell are you gonna go back to the basics this is this is my favorite one actually just the basic simple one I like that a lot all the racing on that's quite cool - alright about to solder off engine start it's like it's like a go-cart disguised as a car that's basically what it is it's like a super sophisticated go-kart super fast super lightweight and no power steering just like a go fun usually I would struggle with that so we're gonna have to see how it goes that's when you really need to like workout at the gym cuz some cars without power steering it's just it's so difficult to turn so let's see how this one is do you want to hear it the nice thing about this is there's no roof so you can really hear the engine that's quite cool alright what else can I show you here it's very simple here inside you've only got a couple of buttons these are just for the headlights you've got a kill switch and a hazard light and that's pretty much it and look at this it's like Lolly's stripped down I love all the carbon fiber in here it's beautiful isn't it everywhere you look carbon fiber lava okay let's go it really just does feel like a super-fast go-kart you can feel everything no power steering but actually it's really easy to turn [Music] maybe one other person is having great fun this car is brand brand-new you guys so I can't what up too many miles on the clock this is a super little fun car to get around in but it's not made for device summer I've literally got the hottest wind blowing at my face right now it's like 40 42 degrees or something okay let's alright it's quick you guys 3.2 seconds 0 to 100 [Music] I think you need a helmet with this car if you're gonna get off any speed you need something protecting your face [Music] [Music] laughter thanks to Lotus let me just turn her off there's actually a kill switch here you guys look just press this got a reset it though if you want to restart the girl all right there you go thank you so much to Lotus this is actually the only 311 430 in the entire region so it is super special for me to be able to experience this so I'm massive thank you to Lotus and to you guys for watching I love you guys so much thank you so much for being part of the supercar blondie family give the video a quick thumbs up and subscribe to the fam if you haven't yet that's it I think we're out I'm gonna go find some air conditioning you're gonna film me trying to get out you take this Fred there you go right we take good care of that all right hold on hold on to that yes okay see if it's easier to get out then just tryna test which is the strongest bit to hold my weight I think I can see them [Music] it was actually easy to get Outland it will do there we go [Music]", "goQOKCNJNr8": "[Music] hello everyone meet again on the market buy the best quality hot
