{"Uxfzc0yuIG0": "ladies and gentlemen boys and girls terpslots of all legal ages welcome back to puffin pete's medical cannabis review channel and general [ __ ] if this is your first time here welcome like comment share subscribe hit that notification bell lots of fun things in the mix today's a little different uh it's wake and bake i'm getting ready for physical therapy it's payday friday but we're doing an frx review yes we are uh i was a little more excited about this before i got online this morning so we got some frx pharmaceutical rx boop east coast sour diesel diamonds east coast sour diesel diamonds now the reason i say i was more excited about this before is i just saw somebody's picture i'll tell that in a minute okay total cannabinoids 92.58 percent thca 89.67 delta 9 with a 1.79 delta 8 0 thcv 0 says total thc 80.43 total cbd 0 uh cbd cbda cbn cbdv are all zeros cbg with the 0.24 cbga the 0.75 and a cbc with a 0.14 very basic labels that's typical uh frx uh test date february 20th package february 17th we're almost to march 12th today yeah so about a month average total terpenes 1.45 percent which i guess is crazy for diamonds but again i'll tell you what i meant here in a minute uh car .61 humilin 0.26 which must be the top two because they're black and then listen listed up top bis point two two lin point one limonene .06 mercene point o six b pinene point o five french alcohol point o four uh garanil 0.03 carboline oxide 0.01 no i am not a scientist i don't care how i pronounce it i did my best okay the genetics 91 chem dog i can't read that but anyway it's east coast sour diesel now we're gonna break into this so as i was saying i saw somebody's picture of this product on the internet this morning and it looked more like a live sugar not diamonds so i would be kind of disappointed so anyway there's our packet trying to hide my information on the top of the box i hate when they do that there is that so clumsy this morning i haven't medicated okay qc number eight you know apparently qc number eight and i have this relationship where i get a lot of your stuff just saying it's true look at some of the videos uh so this is supposed to be half a gram chem dog and get into it boom the pharmaceutical rx yeah that's that's kind of crap that's uh that's not necessarily what i would call i'm diamonds put the jar lid under it so if i spill any it goes right in there i want you to see this and those are tiny little granules i'm gonna spin the jar it's more like some g-leaf [ __ ] i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of disappointed i expected some more diamond diamonds [Applause] frx with a little bit of a letdown there i mean how can you really call that diamonds i don't know i won't be buying more i thought i was going to pick up a second one for festival but no no not at that price not for that we'll see how it is but it does have uh an aroma nose to it it's decent i'm gonna get a nice big scoop of these diamonds in here i'm not gonna i'm gonna do this without making much of a mess we're gonna probably do two scoops like that all right so there's the one scoop i'm gonna fire that up and then we'll see how we feel and maybe i'll do a second one [Music] so friday [ __ ] really i'm just getting ready i paid off all the merch for fest so it's there she's waiting for delivery um everything's pretty much ready i just gotta get some things finalized and gurney and i got to do inventory for the fest and see what's broken what needs replaced you know how shipping goes but uh yeah we're hoping to do that this weekend hopefully tomorrow we'll see about you guys puffing on i got paid today so i'm gonna hit the dyspo tonight after work and then i'm gonna relax this weekend i don't have a whole lot planned other than some guy time missus has to work and the in-laws are going to babysit the kids so all right i think that's hot enough cheers uh not gonna lie that taste is really good it's kind of sweet i didn't expect that heat that up a little go for a little reheat but uh no it's decent flavor just not impressed what it looked like but they can't all be winners right statistically speaking um it's like the calypso i had it was supposed to be live sugar and it was diamonds and sauce legit diamonds all right you could see through them when you were melting them you could watch them kind of crack before they melt real diamonds um just not impressed by this initially the flavor's good it's not too harsh it's fairly clean my banger so i guess in that regard we'll see how the effects are they were again just not what i was expecting i need to drink before we go in for the second derpsky oh i hope everybody is having a good week and had a good week mine was kind of rough but it's getting better uh things are working out i'm waiting on the gopro to arrive so i can have more footage two different views uh of selfie view pov view down shot you know i'm gonna add some things so that's coming uh waiting for that to arrive and my new lawnmower yay i haven't had a new one ever it's a weird thing to get excited about but i'm at that age um and i own a house so i'm getting a new one because my last one finally shipped to bed and i bought it used got a couple years out of it sold for parts finally getting a new one i'm kind of excited about it it's weird it's like buying a car because i know i'm going to have it forever so yep so basically all this weird [ __ ] that i got going on i'm adulting that's what i've got going on this weekend i'm adulting but let's go in for another derbsky shall we oh on a side note i will say i'm starting to get some good pain relief this morning from this already uh which is nice since i'm about to go to physical therapy it's just going to be painful bring this up here another little scoop it's actually a big scoop and just because i love you guys i'm gonna go in a little bit more we're going to double up on that one so that one's a double scoop i'm really only feeling good physical therapy here i come see the reason i was excited is i thought there was legit gonna be diamonds like i've had before and i had my terp claw out i was gonna pick one up just not the real thing man that's that's sugar guys i don't care what you say that's more sugar than anything disappointing on the overall presentation but it is what it is guys i'm excited for the weekend i'm super stoked for festival to be so cool even better than last year which i didn't think was possible but it's gonna be it's gonna be fun all right here we go cheers oh it's okay oh yeah so this one can kind of unfocus you i will say that uh i was kind of getting lost and thought there for a second while i was taking that dab yes mid-dab so i will say that it's good for pain relief um but it will unfocus you i think at least it did me kind of knocked me off track here i'm definitely a calming strain not as wound up as i was this morning but i am determined i i got this motivation i will say that i got this focus i'm unfocused but i'm focused it's kind of a weird thing to say but by that i mean my thoughts are kind of all over but i'm i have a determination to continue my day i'm gonna it's gonna be positive i've got that missile lock on that target today it's gonna be a good day no matter what yep oh outstanding i mean my feelings the way i feel i feel outstanding i'm gonna say this is i'm only gonna give this a six and a half out of ten um and i'm not trying to be a dick it's just i'm not impressed uh with the overall presentation it's not what i expected it's not what i was buying if i didn't know that's what it looked like i wouldn't have touched it it's more like their beach sand it's not much different um not to say i don't like their beach sands but when you're expecting diamonds you're expecting diamonds not the beet sands or the sugar sorry frx but that's my opinion six and a half out of ten i mean the medication itself is decent i got some good pain relief it's not great not as good as the other stuff i did uh the purple mountain but you know it's got good pain relief i feel a little better i'm a little more limber loosened up ready to go to physical therapy so the flavor's good the aroma is good the effects are mild but decent so that's just what i'm gonna call it uh six and a half out of ten maybe you could go seven if i'm not trying to be i guess i'm trying to be a little harsh but i'm gonna still stick with my six and a half out of ten uh just i would have really liked to see the presentation that just really kills it for me and that's because it's not just a disappointment it's a value for the money so and they're so over expensive anyway in my opinion to have that kind of a letdown really hurts the wallet uh anyway that's what it is i love you guys every last one of you i don't know who needs to hear it but you're all loved you're all needed you're all valued you're all important people like

it's not just Sour Diesel this is super sour diesel taking out those popular parents super Sour Diesel is one incredible sativa a potent cross between super Silver Haze and Sour Diesel super Sour Diesel knocks out stress and pain while fostering creativity and euphoria super Sour Diesel energizes making it great for daytime use new uses however should be cautious when trying this strange super sour diesel produces strong cerebral effects which may be overpowering to the novice okay I'm not a novice let's get in here you guys and even though it's in the bag you guys this is dispensary grade I just got a little bit for my people last night and yeah they opened up the door and he smells came rushing out it was so beautiful this you guys is super Sour Diesel yes I'm sorry I was sitting on a little bit so that butt is kind of flat yes sir you guys the whole room is just built it doesn't it doesn't really smell like a Sour Diesel what I smell really is Silver Haze let's open it up and see what's happening now smell the slight Sour Diesel when I busted the butt open slight Sour Diesel and a lot of silver haze so let's get up in here let's see we get um hey I hope you guys slept like kings and queens cuz me personally y'all always know how sleep like a king one thing that's been bothering me guys while I clean is balled out cuz I had a discussion with somebody about about slavery and they were telling me that you know black people owned slaves too and you know the whole time that I was growing up they never said anything about black people on the slaves the reason why they never said anything about black people enslave is because black people never owned slaves you guys please stop trying to make this a point in history because it never happened listen you guys remember how white people how they tell you how white people looked at slaves back in the day they look they're slaves like we were farm equipment like we was farm tools black people wasn't [ __ ] - white people back in slavery days we was like less than dogs they would treat their dogs better than they treated black people so how do you think that a black man can walk up to this white dude and go hey sir I have this black man I want to sell you they would probably take us both it just doesn't make sense for if I see how how white people treat him treated my brothers and sisters you know this is way back then you know I'm not talking about now even though we're being killed now but if I seen the way white people treated black people way back in the day why wouldn't I as a black man want to sell another black man into this you guys it makes it sound like we're so stupid that we're ignorant enough to have our own people as our own slaves this is a point in history that that the powers that be are trying to clean up their third history their past they're trying to clean up their past to make it look like they wasn't the only ones that owned slaves they probably wasn't the only ones that owned slaves but I can guarantee you one thing black people never owned slaves never they never started bringing that up into light the last couple years the whole time I was going to school nobody ever said anything about black people owning slaves why they never said anything because it never [ __ ] happened anyway you guys we're getting into this super Sour Diesel as I'm busting it open this this just wafting into its wafting into my nostrils oh I love it love it dude he let go we got the ball Pat we got the ice in the ball let go is that like a good old toenail pitch right there only if smoke was coming on the bone sorry oh it started how real smooth like it wasn't gonna do nothing whoo then it expanded in my lungs and really what I taste ah at the frontline when I taste is Silver Haze super Silver Haze that's where I taste at the front line in the back I can taste our diesel [ __ ] that would hit me hard as a mother Senate McGee okay that was really tasty and I'm starting to feel a high but it feels like it's coming from the backlight like I can feel it coming towards my eyes I feel it coming all through my body but I feel it mostly behind my eyes that was just the first hint and I'm sure pop our legs long enough I'd feel a high off that speak up release date here we go forgot my hip width hold on hey now I'm back okay here we go got the hand wiggity

y'all here today maybe tomorrow put a fan at the door sorry y'all and have you blown cool areas anyway I'm gonna scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] Tim being that most awesome [ __ ] we're gonna give the flavor critique of super Sour Diesel we're gonna give it a nine because it is a really beautiful flavor these are flavors that my mind can comprehend because I've had both of them separately before so most of the exotics that I had or the hybrids my mind can't really comprehend because maybe one of the pair I haven't had before so I don't understand the flavor but I understand the flavor of this and I have to give it a 9 it's a really good sweet soured easily flavor you guys know how I feel about Sour Diesel I'm not too fond of super sour or super Silver Haze but I haven't had it a lot I've had it a few times and I've had I think dispensary great but um anyway yeah I definitely give it a 9 um yeah yeah definitely definitely a 9 definitely yes definitely a nine-member y'all remember Rain Man it's a 9 definitely not it might new before y'all talking I was an old-ass movie the movie came out around scar-faced ha in it that is really delicious and now getting on my own nerves with the coffee because I want to get I want to taste it more you know I don't want to [ __ ] call all the table carpet is just to get me to that elevation you know I'm saying that's why I don't mind it I don't say I'm not intentionally coughing but I don't mind coughing because it gives me to that point whenever I smoke a J and I'm not coughing of course I get high man but I don't get that in chicks all right you know that monster ha you know what I'm saying but when I'm coughing and I'm coughing like profusely like the way that a bum man shook off you know this is I believe the second most potent way it may be the third I think this is the third most potent way to get high off cannabis um edibles being the first vaporize to be in a second bong being a third I believe Blunt is fourth and I believe that joint is first or the least it's not really first it's the least the joint gets you the least highest out of all those it goes joint blunt a-bomb vaporizer and then edibles edibles are always at the top because um if you can OD on on cannabis the only way to OD on cannabis is through animals because if you OD on on smoking weed I think you probably have to smoke something like I forgot what they said like 4000 pounds or a thousand pounds in an hour or or thousand pounds and ten minutes it was something impossible something stupid that's the only way to OD but the only way to really OD of cannabis is through edibles and what the [ __ ] is the OD you passing out that's all it is it's not like an OD like on [ __ ] heroin where you actually have to do something let's get your ass to the hospital if you don't shut up so here when they get you oh dear oh let's get your ass to the hospital if you don't smoke too much cracks that you [ __ ] you you oh dude I'm smoking crack let's get your ass to the hospital if you ate too many edibles and your mother [ __ ] asked them I'm passed out an OD don't edibles let's get your ass to the bed [ __ ] night-night [ __ ] go night-night I'll holler at you and then probably in the morning or the next day y'all see them saying the other day so nobody minds odn on cannabis okay I don't even feel like I was getting any smoke do we end of it okay thank you very much I am I feel like I'm at a level time I don't like level toys thank you very much okay bacon a little piece net get that on the bone for the - cheek of this Jake right here okay I feel a high creepin in it a little bit more I hate breaking blood open like this or breaking down like this because it takes some of the trichomes off of it that's why it's bad to grind your weed because if you grind wheat you know how many times those little pins are hitting your weed each time to imagine your finger hitting that but a thousand times that's how many times those little pins are hitting that we did she break it up now matter although strike homes are going if you have the right grinder the trichomes the keith is going to the bottom of that grinder but if you bring them with your fingers you're wasting most of it that's why I'm trying to break it open as little as I can if I'm rolling a blunt you know just bring it up a little bit and let it go you don't sit there and like pick each [ __ ] hair off the buds you know I'm saying like you got some tweezers and [ __ ] you don't do that just trying to pass one little info to y'all if you don't mind uh-huh yeah you know I got to tell you guys I think I got the most awesome channel the reason why I say that because all the people that all the youtubers I seen they talk about haters that they don't had I told you guys before so far I've only had two haters and one of us one of them I converted into a subscriber thank you for subscribing bro um you know the way I feel about a hater man is if if I'm saying something you don't like then there's no need to write a book or a paragraph about it just move on to the next the next youtuber you know I'm saying the next video that you want to watch maybe all my videos aren't good I'm hoping to please everyone and make everyone happy because I want everybody to subscribe to the channel right now I'm at 49% out of 100 people that are viewing our subscribers which is actually beautiful but I want to get it a little higher maybe 75 to 80% we need to get these subscribers up to God so I can start doing these giveaways oh I don't know what I'm gonna start giving we're really don't but I feel like it should be we oriented but if it's we oriented I may have to deliver it personally it won't be we because I'm gonna do that if it is we hey that might be a good thing to you tell me where you're located at and I call your local dispensary father's credit at the dispensary or something that might be a good giveaway to 10 one being a [ __ ] Tim being a good stop of the high pratik of this super Sour Diesel we're also to give this the same thing as the flavor of God we're gonna give it a 9 I don't know if it's a highlight or a loan on it's probably more than on the lower level I really want to give it an 8 for the hide I really want to give it an 8 for the flavor but it keeps creeping and creeping in Cleveland that flavors in the back of my throat I feel a slight burden on the middle part back of my throat where I recommends to my friends abso-fucking-lutely if you guys get a chance to run into this fence regrade super Sour Diesel grab that [ __ ] roll that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] and smoke that [ __ ] dad what'd y'all do I'm taking another row I think you guys can stop my mind I hope this episode was enjoyable as well as informative for you um you guys please stop believin and [ __ ] that the media is telling because it's all [ __ ] believe your own eyes believe what your people tell you believe your own experiences I hope today is better than yesterday and I hope tomorrow I'll shine some both hope you guys have a truly legendary day man y'all be blessed you ain't gotta get home you're gonna go home but you got here y'all are anonymous they stay big man", "S_PLcfNv_gg": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps welcome to season 3 everybody and for our video here today we're gonna be checking out some himalaya super sour diesel for the most part i don't really like distillate stuff right but there are some good distillate brands out there and himalaya is for show one of those so i had their live resin first if for those of you who are veterans of the channel you guys know i did try out uh something a long time ago but before we go and more into that let's go ahead take a hit y'all thank you guys for joining me for season three and uh once again is that super sour diesel from himalaya vapor and i got that battery from him too right here so cheers up everybody hope you guys are enjoying your day or whatever time it may be when you're watching man cheers [Music] it's a tiny little hit there just because we want to get that flavor so a big thing about these this himalayan distillate cartridge so far is that flavor man on the box here it says terpene rich you know what i'm saying and this is for show terpene rich this tastes phenomenal like out of all the distillates i have had this definitely sets in the smoothest you know hits the smoothest and i'm not getting too much scratchiness from my throat there and it definitely has the most kind of like cannabis kind of taste if that's a word kind of busy but um you know it doesn't taste like artificial flavors or fruit or anything like that it just tastes like some really good terps like you know that you could probably you know find you know your normal flour and all that so that's that's what we're rocking with here man i know i didn't say the percentages but here we go we got 91 total active cannabinoids in this one so this cartridge for show can pack a punch so that's the good thing you know they're not really listing out that thc percentage which isn't a bad thing for me that's normally a good sign when i see cannabinoid percentage over thc percentage you know we all want that you know uh uh entourage effect you know full spectrum type of high and uh you gotta appreciate it with a product like this man so let's go ahead and take a blinker now and i'll talk more about what i'm tasting and [ __ ] so cheers everybody [Music] oh man now that hit packed a freaking punch man so this is a sativa strain not exactly one more like my favorites you know what i mean like uh sativa is not exactly what i prefer to smoke on but a super sour d is a classic and i am digging the flavors we're getting here pininess some sour there not it's not too crazy of a sour um i know sometimes when i try super sour diesel that limonene sticks out hella tough and it makes it taste a lot more lemony instead of like just regular kind of like like a sour tinge and that's what i'm getting here you know i'm not getting too much of a citrusy sour i'm just getting like a quick little undertones of it with a little tiny little bit of sweetness but mostly that gassy kind of piney flavor so that's it's good stuff man it's real good stuff okay so for those of you who are curious man we're working with about 431 milligrams thc 1.2 milligrams of cbd well that's that's all i can say about this you know the cartridge so far guys i like the flavor it is indeed terpene rich 91 total cannabinoids this thing will smack you and um you know it's just a smooth cartridge man unless you're taking a fat hit you're probably not gonna cough much off this one it's really smooth so we're gonna take one last hit here end off the video and i hope you all have been enjoying it and i hope y'all go check out some more himalaya products man they make great great stuff and be sure to watch out because guys let me go pull this out real quick we are going to have another himalaya product pop up soon this one is the blueberry muffin live resin cartridge i've been waiting a long time to open this one so thank you guys for watching let's take one more hit here and before i take this hit guys don't forget to like comment subscribe share the video whatever you want to do all that [ __ ] man but yeah thank you guys so much and [Music] cheers yes this [ __ ] is guys michelle so this has been p2 peeps and i hope you guys are going to be enjoying more content and things coming soon

that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this strain and that's about it other than the terps you guys are hitting on t nine club well very much appreciate the honesty man and the transparency on what you're

review peace", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily you guys do it all the time man when i don't ask you guys to smash that like button you guys are over here hitting 400 500

you guys on game all right boys so with that being said let's go ahead and narrow this down buddy's cartridge fire um you know i'm sad that it kind of took me so long to hop on this buddy's wave you know i was just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be definitely copying these a lot more copying the earth is a lot more i want to try a 710 um pod again uh tier one possibly and just see how how that gets me i could already like imagine dude just how fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would be the nine out of ten for me so um yeah we're ending out the video here if you guys enjoyed today's man video do me one last favor let's smash that like button let's get over 600 likes comment

that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing

teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

review but something a little different uh make sure you like comment subscribe all that stuff as usual and uh i just updated the ranking system for the previous videos got some more videos coming up in the next week or two and have a huge sweet christmas stash that's going to be uh ordered here in the next week i'm so going to be doing a whole bunch of videos over christmas holidays which i'm pretty excited about so uh today we're gonna do a couple 510 cartridge reviews um so i've got the daily special og kush and the daily special uh super sour diesel so got both of these at the same time on the ocs obviously and uh i have to admit not bad i really enjoyed smoking them and the convenience of the carts themselves um i found for me personally with these two carts um that was probably two or three four pulls that got me to a good sweet spot of being high um the taste i found on the og kush to be a little bit better than the super sour diesel did not have a real chemical taste which was nice um i know these aren't the live resin um aren't you know the full spectrum they're the distillate but still i enjoyed them not bad didn't clog at all used the super sour diesel pretty much all up and looks like it's a pretty clean chamber not much residue left there were no air bubbles even after the cartridge has been used it's pretty clean um yeah i know i'm pretty excited about it um same with the og kush looks like i'm pretty much three quarters of the way through and uh yeah same thing overall seems to be a pretty good cartridge for the price i would love to try some of the um full spectrum the live resin all those type of things heard really good stuff about the gray beard but also heard a couple complaints that it was clogging um what was the other one the white rhino island honey the pure the full spectrum from pure sun farm i would like to try those two just as a comparison but i find with these ones anyways with the distillate that it doesn't get me as high as the actual flower more of a short term intense head high opposed to a longer term full body high on a flower and by full body i don't mean you know a body high but more of like a full i guess for lack of better word full spect from high i don't know it's different i find anyways maybe other people feel differently but i find with the distillate it's more of a intense head high rush um also want to try the new bingo carts out there i suspect they're probably pretty similar to the daily special um but yeah so not bad so i've got none left of the super sour diesel oh like i said probably a quarter left of the og kush so why don't we try a little bit here just so you guys can see firsthand what it's like and uh obviously you can't put these ones under the microscope but you guys can at least get the uh the taste and um overall experience with this card itself so let's give it a shot and see [Music] laughs i find it like a little bit more harsh too with the um with the carts that's a nice taste doesn't taste too chemically which is good um like i said it's got some decent it's almost skunky sort of but i like it and for the discreteness discreetness and convenience i'll probably buy these you know as a uh a little traveling kit although we're not traveling much anymore um but maybe you know just for something throughout the day where you want to quit something quick nice and easy but you know i i would suggest if you enjoy cards something cheap these were good i would probably buy them again um let's give another shot and see [Music] [Music] excuse me [Music] blew a cloud on that one boys and girls um thc percent i think they came in at around 80 which is pretty good um i wonder though [Music] you know what's the other 20 obviously it's to distill it but like what's the percentage of to distill it that is probably not the best for you should we say i wouldn't say you know uh toxic but you know 80 thc what's the other 20 i don't know hopefully more clarity comes with this industry and these carts and the live resin the full spectrum all that kind of [ __ ] we stay away more from the uh butane extractions and all that kind of stuff um and just don't find them to be the most enjoyable to smoke but like i said if you guys like this kind of stuff if you like these carts definitely try this uh daily special og kush super sour diesel out and let me know your thoughts and look forward to doing some really good videos for you guys in the coming weeks like i said um got some pretty good stuff gonna be ordering on deck i'm going to be getting some wapa radicand i really want to get some white wedding and i'm from miss foo um what was the other ones that i wanted to get white wedding guapa um royal city i want to get the uh rc goddess there's one more that i was really excited about getting but anyways i'll be doing a huge like uh review and pictures and all that kind of good [ __ ] so stay tuned guys and girls for our next video here and uh look forward to uh talk to you guys next time alright enjoy", "HuZleIDc1YE": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another strain review today we're going to be reviewing Sour Diesel aka sour deep good this is an excellent sativa dominant strain named after is poachin diesel like aroma and it's thought to be a cross between gem dark and super skunk making it like a potent string this strain tested between 20 and 25 percent TAC and the planet self-taught it's a fairly lean and he tends to [ __ ] sale a lot when it's ready but you can he's thinking of the room is pungent fuel skunk sit his nugs good this train is really potent and it's very popular in United States because it's energized and positive high most people use this for depression or stress but it's also good for anxiety and pain relief as always we're gonna try it out off already clean Bow Wow when you grind it it the smell is overpowering his punch and it's really pungent like when I was breaking I was barely it smells good and it is a little strong but once you grind it it's really purging like I could smile I will be here like he suppose like I had a bunch or something is is really pungent Wow it smells so good has an earthy taste to it not too crazy about the taste let's see how he feels this year how long it takes to hit again I'm not too crazy about the taste we should try it out of a wrapper riser you guys not about price right I'll show you in a few yeah no not too crazy about the taste it has a bad aftertaste too once you boil the small the earthy taste comes in you blow it out and it just stays behind I don't like that earthy taste I think it was gonna taste a lot better yes it's more a little citrusy he's you know I wonder why it tastes like this this is brought out the volcano you guys already know this puppy right here it's turning around you know wait for that to hit that 445 we're gonna fill this up and then we gotta try it off the volcano let's see we didn't fill this one up right here and they're gonna see what it tastes like out of it you know what does everything tastes a lot better out of the volcano like it's completely two different flavors completely distinct flavors I will spoke down and then you give me this you tell me this is called some fake ass name and this is the real deal I believe you I believe these are two different strains because they taste completely different they even feel completely different going down there's no aftertaste it tastes a lot better I still don't taste the citrus that I smell earlier but it doesn't taste like Sour Diesel my point being it tastes like if I was smoking or out of these this little bait pants I ran out of this one but he says mood and he has a taste of one cartridge my body feels really relaxed but my mind won't stop thinking I thought it was gonna pull me at least as well but my mind will just won't stop thinking I can't stop thinking about these lines now but I'm like to relax to work on any design Hey it's not gotcha potato motifs you know I'll get up I'll do what I gotta do I don't feel like I gotta be stuck on the couch or anything like that but my body feels really relaxed and my body running my mind just I can't stop thinking my throat's a little harsh and I think that's from smoking it out of the oh it was harsh going in with a nice nasty aftertaste it's in about seven minutes and I'm stoned like don't I think it's because it's multiple and a full back from the volcano Lister you're another of those game yeah I mean it's so different my shoes which was another go to heart or my throat this is like the second or third strain that I have come across that is a little harsh in my throat all the restraints are pretty smooth mmm the vapor so far none of it has been harsh if you guys see the review of the volcano and my brother I guess the vapor is too much for him shall vapor could be harsh to some people but not to me the flavor is better after babe I'm just finishing this one so nice to stay there and the race I just gonna flirt on my baby another thing I don't like about it is I don't know if it's the strain or or what's going on but I can't stop thinking and it's not I'm not thinking about random thoughts I've just my toes are center focused on creation like I want to draw something I want to design something and I maybe throw a little bit of gaming in there but my point is that I can stop thinking about drawing or design so there's I guess it feels like somebody just went and hit a creative switch and now I can stop thinking about drawings and designs you know what that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna draw something for my deviantART page and play some games well guys if you guys liked the review let me know in the comments below don't forget to Like and subscribe for more reviews coming up and I talk to you guys to the next one peace [Music]", "21yp9A9wxr4": "[Music] p2pt what's good y'all p2 peeps here and today we're going to be taking a look at the buddies distillate with cannabis rep terpenes sorry i almost forgot what we were doing but yeah uh the other day i opened this on stream um and i was you know i was really hoping to save the opening of this for a video but you know couldn't help everyone's saying try it out on stream and um honestly zero regrets i've been looking for buddies for so long and i'm just i'm just super super satisfied with the way this this hit this this turned out like like i'll tell you guys right now i've been looking for buddies a buddy's car for like four months now i saw it first on a simplistic youtube channel and i was like whoa this looks crazy like i'm not big on distillates uh some of you guys know that some of you guys don't i kind of quit cartridges for the first time or the first time i started trying cartridges i quit because i didn't really like distillates and i had no idea what live resin or cured resin was at the time and so now that i know what live resin and cute resin is i've gotten more into cartridges and since i've gone back into cartridges got back into this lids so without further ado let's take our hit of this and i'll discuss you know what we normally discuss the flavors and you know what i'm feeling about it so everyone out there at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready open your bag of chips whatever it is get your your water i don't know we're all just gonna you know cheers together and yeah so cheers boys for a distillate the flavor and that is impeccable like i'm really impressed with this buddies card stuff like before i tried this right you guys were able to see on the channel i was able to try another canon striped terpenes type cart it was a stizzy pot the i tried the grape sorbet and the super glue silver lines dizzy pods and the one thing i'll say about them in comparison to this buddies is that they don't have like they don't hold a candle they don't hold a candle of this i've only had one this is my very first buddies i'm not even done not even done with it and already i can tell you guys that this is much better than the stizzy derived cannabis terpene or stizzy cannabis derived terpenes line um and this is my honest opinion guys like i was expecting so much more when i um got the cannabis to drive terpenes pods from stizzy i was expecting so much more i spent like 70 bucks per gram 70 75 bucks per gram for them and um it just was it just didn't didn't hit as hard as i thought it would you know i wasn't expecting it to knock me out like a [ __ ] truck or anything like that right but i was expecting the flavor to be very very very very nice like there were a lot of people who were telling me like it's comparable to live resin carts which i thought was a stretch i think that's a stretch in in any in most regards like even even this distillate with cannabis derivatives this doesn't this doesn't really hold a candle to the flavor that you can get from eyebrows and cartridges right but this is still very very good yeah i get a lot of sweetness tones or sweet tones from this you know tiny little bit of tartness and there a little bit of sour um and pininess yeah so another good thing about buddies cards is that on the back of their packaging they've got the terpene profile right there for you so you know maybe not ex exactly you kind of know exactly what flavors you'll get with just looking at the back of this so the back of this right we've got ter profile 2.61 limonene 1.25 percent limonene is a terpene that is responsible for that lemony citrusy flavor um a mirror scene i think if i'm if i'm remembering this correctly i will correct myself later but mirror scene is the sweet stuff that's the generalized okay just i'm generalizing and pining the piney stuff so all that pine soul whatever piney taste that i've been talking about that's that's actual stuff yeah so that's that's what the most i can say about this you know buddies card so far i like it it's got great flavor it's better so far in terms of flavor and effect than the cannabis drive terpene pods from sizzy so yeah let's take another hit of this and um see if i can find anything different in terms of its flavor for you guys so yeah cheers everybody that pininess really sticks out in the uh the initial taste i didn't really comment too much about that but yeah i think it starts again nice piney lemony citrusy kind of flavor and then it finishes off with some very nice sweet tartness which is kind of like a candy really really nice so yeah i highly recommend you guys try a buddy's distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived or distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived terpenes cartridge this this stuff is really good sorry i'm kind of big like i can't even speak properly it's it's already affecting me yeah i've been it's i'm just really happy with being able to find something and not being disappointed with it um i was a little disappointed with the silver lines dizzy pods but i'm gonna give them another chance for sure because you know i just might not lie to i might not have liked the strain but yeah legend og watermelon skittles card this one's definitely a must try i mean i've had watermelon skittles a lot of times but in its live resin caviar form so having it in this uh this little can this little oil form is pretty nice yeah that should about wrap it up for this really quick cart review you know nothing too in-depth just just letting you guys know how i feel about it we'll definitely get more in depth when we get to a cart comps with this uh be on the lookout for that we'll be doing a cart comps between this buddy's cart and uh the very next cart you guys see in our individual cart reviews that that's going to be the one that will stack up so they're going to be some pretty hard hitters yeah thanks everyone for watching and we'll take one more hit for the road for you guys cheers oh yeah thank y'all for watching and we're going to see you on the next one for shout peach you out peace", "rcJJHgsx0wQ": "[Music] what is going on YouTube I'm a little different out here in my backyard today here it's a nice

up y'all p two peeps coming at you real quick because we just got out of the dispenser we got a few things here real quick let me just pull it out uh for the video purposes some platinum vape animal cookies uh a new brand maybe you guys haven't seen americana black lime ochie whatever and i've been looking for this for a while to try out some dime bag concentrate yeah uh come back to you real quick with some samples what is up y'all p2 peeps and i'm going to be doing a real quick cart review on uh the americana black lime og cart so i just got this and like you guys probably saw in the intro you know this was part of that haul so this is a indica strain it is 92 thc which is very impressive for a distillate um in my opinion i know that there are a lot of you know strong distillates out there um but yeah 90 92 is no joke for a thc percentage that's not that's not bad um there's no cbd percentage in here so we're not really getting that entourage effect uh with this one i feel but you know what we'll see i have had uh americana cartridges before i've tried pineapple express i unfortunately did not have a youtube channel or even plans for one at the time but yeah so this is what it looks like you guys can see the oil there very golden colored not too bad you know i think that's very solid so let's go take our first hit and for those of you out there watching go pack yourself a bowl your dab get your pen ready all that good stuff because we're about to get started cheers boys oh surprisingly that has a very rich flavor for a distillate i am actually really impressed with that um the pineapple express also had that very nice rich flavor to it too very sweet aftertones to that i like that you know this is probably like a blackberry cushcross and uh blackberry crush is one of my favorite strains so yeah i'll take one more hit for y'all in this little clip here so yeah this is very tasty very tasty and it's only like uh i think i got this 40 gram 35 gram yeah not too bad not too bad for a whole gram um so yeah i'll jump back to you guys later with uh more develop thoughts on it but yeah let's get your p2 peeps and we are about to check out our delivery pickup we got some new cartridges here today finally found them the buddies distill it with live resin or cannabis drive terpenes i think yeah but yeah everyone said a lot of good things about this one and i am so excited to try i got one of those there and this was a little freebie we got really nice really nice that's a half gram old pal clementine i've never tried uh old pal concentrates so yeah we'll definitely give this one a go later it's a bargain bin kind of brand so i'm not expecting too much but you never know and this is really nice i've been looking for this brand for quite some time as well honey leaf one of the newer things i've seen around really like the packaging as well you guys will be seeing this very soon and our final thing we got another buddies live resin this time with diamonds really really really excited to try the uh buddies cartridges you know simp is always talking about them and um you know probably for good reason so yeah that's what we got for our quick little pickup today and uh we'll give them a quick try in a bit", "9lbHw4yov5U": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps here and today we've got uh another buddies liquid diamonds cartridge yes sir we've got the new york city diesel cartridge this is about i believe 86 total cannabinoids we're working with a hybrid strain here and uh two percent cbd in this one 82 thc so uh yeah pretty nice pretty nice stats there for the cannabinoids we've got we're working with a 7.45 percent terp profile uh here's the back for you guys so you can read that come on focus and there we go yeah i'll be sure to leave the two uh profiles up in the video as well uh but yeah so this is uh our third buddies cartridge that you've seen on the channel our second liquid diamonds one and um you know let's just get this started the same way we always do with a hit and you know i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting and other notes that i have i guess so everyone please pack your bowl pack your dabs get your pen ready all that good stuff you know the drill guys cheers [Music] oh all right so getting kind of a little little little hint of sour notes in there um hmm it's not too too heavy on the sourness i guess you know i'm not getting a tang there nothing to make me like pucker my lips or anything either but there is a sour flavor but i'm also getting a kind of doughy and creamy creaminess to it too uh the flavor here is a little bit uh reminiscent to the oreo cream uh like cured resin cartridge i had from friendly farms but obviously different so it's similar in that kind of creamy creamy taste that it has and uh very interesting because uh compared to the banjo cart that we've had guys on the channel which was a i believe a sativa it was a lot more like it had a lot more tanginess and souriness than this does you know more like a it stood out more you know the pioneering stood out or not the piney the lima needs to sit out a little bit more um in this one limonene is only about 1.36 so uh you know that might be a reason why but we also get a little bit of the sweet tones um and um yeah i'm not picking up too much else outside of that but let me go ahead and take another hit for you guys here and yeah cheers okay now i'm trying to pick up more of that uh that tank but it's still very very subtle so one thing i'll say about this as well is it's a little bit darker in color than the other buddies cartridge we've had let me see if that will focus up on the camera please yeah it's a little bit darker in color um and uh then the banjo liquid diamonds but obviously that might you know that's going to vary between batches and strains but um it's just about the right color i'd expect for a live resin cartridge and it's very smooth i really like how smooth all the buddies liquid diamonds eyebrows and cartridges have been for me uh you know i've heard some people have some negative things to say about the buddies cartridges i for one in my personal experience have nothing bad to say so uh you know that's where it is but um this definitely one of my favorite cartridge brands this may not be my favorite strain pickup or whatever you know what have you but it's surprisingly good you know i wasn't expecting much out of this train in the first place so uh being satisfied with it is good enough for me and um yeah so let's rather that's all i've got to say about this cartridge so far i do think you guys should check this one out as well buddies make some very very good stuff and you know this new york city diesel is definitely one of those things so let's take one more hit for you guys here i hope you guys will join me for this last one in the video so cheers you know this may not be a flavor profile for me but i still do think that it's very tasty i definitely prefer the banjo but this is still tasty in its own right well that's all i have for you guys in this one i hope you guys tune in for the cartridge comp that is coming very soon and i want to say a big thank you to everyone who's been watching so far uh you know the likes the comments and everything has been very encouraging for me and i hope that i can continue to make you guys happy with the content and continue to get better with this stuff too so thanks for watching everybody please don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you enjoyed and i hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is when you're watching this p2 out peace [Music] foreign", "AKy6CXaqESI": "welcome to community cannabis review today I'm going to be reviewing a Mojave brand live resin cartridge I'm doing a quick little video which I did as well with hush because quite frankly I just want to get these cartridges in my beep and same with my girlfriend she once said as well so I'm just gonna get a review down because I don't have these on my channel and I don't know that I'll buy these again as I already have a couple favorite brands and if anyone was wondering what they're like how about we show you this much so you know so I bought this for 1916 that's how much it is made I believe it's like $22 rent something like that this is made by the same company from what I've looked into as hush the hush Brandon carts are just distillate and little canvas terpenes you get I get this for $16 out the door these ones are live resin mixed with distillate from what I can see on the ingredients they're also they're both made by A&M company or Co or what have you but anyway as I said on the hush brand ones I used to not get these because I could swear they used non cannabis dr terpenes which i'm not a fan of and now it appears that they've changed with a flavoring ban so that's the that's the whole thing I'm trying to get this open gingerly but stuff I'm not working oh this tape that's why I'm not destroy this package there's oh you know what we make sure that you all can see the info before I get to undo it so that's the strain information sativa Kim Sour Diesel seventy six percent THC two point five since CBD down with something like eighty seven percent total cannabinoids decent amount herb septic the one with the moose terpenes actually now I don't believe I did there's one that's slightly more here's any other info on the back I know before I'm going to a legal state I just loved watching these videos to look at stuff like this so I want to try and make sure you all can see as much of that as you can very cool stuff comes with something awfully similar to hush so another giveaway I just do a same brand but you can just check the back and it says well alright so it's not a bad looking live resin cart nothing glaringly bad about it and grab my vessel Georgia pop it in and see looks like a good standard see so um weird no thought it wasn't screwing in alright so we'll start it add 2 2 point 7 volts for flavor getting Sour Diesel oh yeah 3.7% Terps isn't terribly a lot for live rising compared to some of the buddies liquid diamonds live resin you're seeing stuff like 14% terpenes it's out there I mean it's ridiculous really good stuff but for $20 $19 or what-have-you this is not bad really not bad not on the same level as buddies but my med price for the buddy's liquid diamonds live resin is 30 out the door so I get to save some money here and lose a little bit of quality but I mean it's totally passable I avoided some budget brands before entirely I would just not buy them but these are good in a pinch I wouldn't be against using these at all me bump up the voltage and try one more cloud before I jump out of here 1 2 3 I have trouble with it sometimes solid cart solid cart so um thanks for watching hopefully my next videos will be slightly better quality put together a little bit but as you can probably see it's a million [ __ ] degrees out here and we have yet to get an AC in our apartment so a little insufferable right now but I wanted to just get two quick videos out there because I wanted to make sure that I put these on the internet in case anyone had any questions before I just go through these in the day and then never think of them again and soon you guys if I can never get our stand dabbing which I'm not a greatest fan o Keeffe and for some reason of I got a whole lot of stuff to review review lots of live res and lots of diamonds diamond sauce you know I just want stuff so stay tuned and hopefully I'll knock out some of that pretty soon here", "BKbNIl4Ryug": "youtube what up cushy here uh today we have the new prime uh cartridge uh from prime wellness uh african tie coming in thc on this baby

really stoked for this one as soon as you guys see it you'll see why i'm saying that these uh these this product is only available in half grams live resin and they claim to be twice the amount of terps two times the terps that's what they claim and that's you see it right there guys heavy hitters heavy [ __ ] hitters excuse my language i'm bringing you guys lemon gelato first time ever trying lemon gelato gelato is an amazing strain as you guys know it's supposed to taste like blueberry sherbet and lemon with a hint of citrus and earthy that's what it says on their website this is a hybrid i'm gonna go ahead and read everything that i'm showing you guys here because it never focuses and never wants to let you guys know what the deal is so thc is coming in at 70.04 percent cbd is coming in at 0.12 percent just a little bit total active cannabinoid 73.56 percent manufactured and packaged the same date 7 9 20 20. so it's about four or five months old um six months old maybe let's go ahead and open it guys already uh rip it's a sticker this sticker holds it in place so that way you can't pull it out all you all i did was lift that sticker and that's literally all done with the box they're live these are only available in half grams you just push right here and it slides right out packaging is nice i love how they show the product i like how you can see the oil in the box and let's go let's get into it guys i haven't had a heavy hitter in years i haven't tried heavy hitters in so long they got the sticker they got the marijuana warning label but as a sticker which is no problem just take that off oil looks nice oil looks real nice uh kind of looks similar to the distillate in a way the distillates more yellowish this is more of an orange tone to it but looks nice for live resin you know half gram you know you see the head space right there you can see all the way straight through that [ __ ] a lot of headspace it's all right though you know it's normal i like how it says live right here it has the word live along with the heavy hitters double h logo take this rubber stopper off and let's see if i can get any flavors you guys any uh any aromas any scents or all that let's go ahead i like the tip like the tip it's not my favorite tip but it looks nice i'm not a big fan of it but i like how it looks all right let's go ahead and see if i can smell anything i do get a hint of sherbet the sherbet's there i don't taste anything but i do smell the strawberry it's definitely there all right let's go ahead and go for a draw let's go in for a drive this is my first time ever reviewing a half gram i've had a half gram in forever let's go ahead and see what this puppy is all about heavy hitters lemon gelato let's go cheers first smoke of the day wow that tasted really good lung expansion is there it fears that it fills the throat fills the lungs almost almost feels like a dab in the chest i did get i did taste the blueberry it's uh it's definitely there i didn't get the i didn't get too much citrus or lemon tones but i got blueberry for sure like blueberry was very strong sorry for anybody all the people walking by i'm at the park right now a lot of people this is a famous for a famous park for our people running around which is what i'm about to do after this review i'm gonna get stoned and run around this [ __ ] but in terms of heavy hitters it uh did their live resin um it's not very immediate but then that's also because it's live resin so i wouldn't expect it to be very immediate after a couple minutes it'll probably settle in and the high will start to fill it it's a hybrid so i do feel it a little bit in my head a little bit it's my first smoke of the day so i was sober before taking this first drag it tastes good i like the taste i'm not gonna lie i like the taste it's very it's very resiny with a hint of blueberry and you taste the sherbet but i'm trying to get the lemon i love lemon so let me see if i can get the lemon in there you smell the oh it smells like gelato all the way as soon as i vaped it now i'm smelling it from the tip smells like gelato all the way all right let's go let's go for another another puff big hit guys big foreign well here's the throat this one leaves your throat very scratchy for anyone wondering it's starting to sedate my eyes now eyes are starting to get real low all in all it's not bad it's definitely not a it's not as good as i was expecting it to be and reason being i thought it would be more um we'll talk about the potency in a bit you know i got to give it a couple more minutes before i can uh really say if it's potent or not but there's you know in terms of flavor the flavors the flavor is good it's um it's not very in your face type of flavor though it's not like something that like right there that last hit i completely missed flavor like there was no flavor in that last hit which is something that was happening a lot with the select for some reason so i don't know what's up with that but i did the what uh one hit i was able to get blueberry and some sherbet out of there so let's go ahead for uh another one guys this is very more this is definitely more of a sativa dominant hybrid in my uh experience vaping it right now it's uh i barely feel anything in the body really it's more of a cerebral high um so [Music] let's go for another one man let's see if this gets me uh if i can get a body high in this if i can feel a body huh so these guys right here i gotta be honest guys this is uh some good product but it's not something i would recommend you guys to go out and pick up reason being these half grams go for 60. i only got this one because it was a 25 off discount only reason why i got it so for 60 half gram i would completely avoid this like this is not even something that i would look in the direction of being in 60 bucks like maybe maybe for like a 30 buck 35 half gram maybe it's all right but i'll be honest the high is not very uh potent it's not uh it's not very uh in your face type of high like i feel it but i feel it very minimum like it's a very minimal miniscule high the bear uh it's barely there uh it's almost like i'm trying to compare it to a a vape cartridge that will give you a similar type of eye that's not very intense but it's uh it's pretty mellow it's relaxing um and i can't think of one at the moment because everything is so different you know so this is definitely in its own category it has a good high it has a good medicating effect to it but it's not very noticeable if that makes sense like the only reason why i'm able to pinpoint what i'm feeling is because i'm paying attention to it and i'm sitting here not doing anything but if i was on the goals i was if i'm if i was working and doing anything else i probably wouldn't even notice the high that i'm feeling so i would definitely skip out on this on this [ __ ] guys i would not try this this is lemon gelato and it doesn't taste as good as i was expecting it to i was like lemon gelato i have smells never had it sounds amazing doesn't taste as good as i thought it would so i would definitely would skip on this [ __ ] for sure two times the terps i don't know about that i don't know what that means i mean i would assume it means exactly what it's telling you it has twice the amount of terps but what i'm tasting isn't what they're telling me so who knows but let's see if i can i'll raise it to 3.3 volts and see if that changes anything cheers guys this wow a lot of vapor a lot of smoke so the flavor's there like you taste what it's telling you but i'm missing the lemon and the gelato taste isn't very um strong for being twice the terps it's like i picked the gelato up i pick up the flavor you're supposed to get but i pick it up for like a second or two and then it's gone as soon as i blow it out usually with another uh like ursa i always talk about ursa but they're fire guys ursa every hit is tasty until the smoke is completely gone out of your mouth like hitting it it's you're tasting it inhaling it you taste it and then exhaling it you still taste it for a little couple seconds this you when you're in when you only taste it on the inhale and then it's gone like the flavor's gone you don't taste anything blowing it out it's just like smoke and that could be because uh of how hot that dab was dab i mean it's 3.3 volts so it's not that bad the regular heavy hitter voltage is 3.7 but this is being live resin you know i'm not going to hit it on 3.7 that's ridiculous going to melt it but go ahead and uh one two three take it back to green 2.8 actually let's go back to blue that was actually a big hit i like that it got me more medicated so you might this the thing about heavy hitters you might just have to take heavy hits because it feel i mean it feels alright but for for the first smoke of my day like this is my first smoker in my day and it's already like about to be 1 pm it's first smoke of the day guys and my eyes are not like you know my eyes i'm doing this on purpose my eyes are not like that that's how i would normally be after reviewing some some dope product like my i would be like gone you know so me not feeling that already tells me that this isn't as a as potent as the maybe as the other cartridges they have but it's not as definitely not as potent as other brands that i've had definitely not as much as the select the selectors would fire so let's go ahead and uh take a last final hit for this uh in terms of my final opinion on it i mean vapor is there amazing vapor you get a lot of smoke the flavor is uh you know it's a it's a it's a 50 50 because the flavor is there but it's not there every hit so that's like you know that's not that's not good obviously and potency i would say the potency isn't there so i wouldn't i would skip this one if you're looking to get super high super baked i would i would probably skip on this one for sure and then the price guys that that that that kills it so the price totally kills it like don't even don't even bother like don't even bother trust me you're not it's not worth the 60 bucks it's not worth 40 bucks half a gram i don't know why they're worth uh why they're priced at that high but definitely not worth it so i'm going for this last final hit guys and then i'm gonna call it hope you guys are enjoying hope you guys like comment subscribe um if you're 18 or below 18 or younger please hop off the video if you haven't already and yeah let's go for this last hit cheers again no flavor damn that's unfortunate guys because lemon gelato's fire and lemon gelato sounds fire so it's unfortunate i'm not getting the the the taste that i would expect from it but nonetheless all those hits and i still feel the same as i did after the first hit so that's i'm not getting any higher i'm not so that's damn that's definitely not good for this i hope you guys don't waste your money on this [ __ ] and you guys will catch me in the next one i hope you guys enjoy comment anything that uh you guys how you guys feel about heavy hitters i mean someone recommending me they're distillate and after trying the live resin which is just as much as their distillate is for a full gram of that i don't even know if i want to try it but i might try it in the future just because it might be better who knows it's this lit but i hope you guys enjoy like comment subscribe and support your boy i appreciate all the support i appreciate everyone watching and thank you guys peace", "qdOcDMeqRv8": "I am

man you guys wrong here we go", "DEZfrbPvxiY": "good sunday afternoon youtube and instagram fam it is your boy puff and pete and i'm coming at you with a new one again as you saw in the last review i was forced to make a choice between sticking to my nothing over 65 and not having medication for the next week so i did buy some rhythm however you know it is what it is um i had to get it i needed medication so it's just i'm gonna continue to stick with my nothing over 65 as much as humanly possible but i only have one dispensary within an hour of my house um other than that i have to drive more than two and a half hours one way to have any other option so unlike most of people that live in more urban populated areas have three or four dispensaries they can drive to within a few minutes i don't have that luxury and my dispensary is not one of those big giant names like beyond hello or anything where they've got a huge selection you don't get a lot so before you go busting my balls full disclosure that is what it is i've got what i've got i can do what i can do so with that said we are doing rhythm it is a sativa it is sour diesel live resin yes sour diesel live resin i was pretty excited about this for the terpene profile um total cannabinoids is 79.8 percent and of course i love sour diesel anything sour diesel i'm going to try it uh thc 0 thca 77.9 cbd 0 cbga 0.7 cbg 0.7 thcv 0.5 total terpenes 13.2 percent let me say that again folks 13.2 percent total terpenes 13.2 percent mercene three point one percent it's a lot of mercy limonene three point one percent that's a lot of limonene b car two point two percent terpenoline one percent humaline point seven percent and pinene point six percent this is packaged july 8th so it's over a month old um i got this august 22nd 23rd somewhere in there so it's a little over a month old but i am excited to try it i do like sour diesel um and it's got a great terpene profile and given how my weekend's gone i could use a little it's my first week back to work uh wasn't too bad um next week's gonna be my first full week back obviously starting tomorrow monday and uh i'll probably be covering for another co-workers having their own health issues so and hers could are a bit more severe than mine possibly so might be covering four for the foreseeable future all right find your rhythm got my sativa concentrate and that cute little yellow jar they got oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] look at that and this light on i don't know if you can see it in the jar i can kind of see it there's some diamonds in that resin yes there is i can see it right there in the center of the jar there's two or three diamonds right there in the center of my resin oh that makes me happy can't go wrong with that so this stuff looks just nice and funky i can actually see the g and whatnot on the or the numbers 09 whatever it is on the bottom of the jar pg proctor game whatever i could see that through the resin with the light on i can actually see the shadow of my hand through it and yes sure enough there's a nice big old diamond in the center and a small one next to it very cool that smells outstanding very uh lemony piney i guess citrusy oh i could just sit there and smell that i really could i could just sit right there and smell it and be happy for a little bit oh yes so i'm gonna get that little diamond out the center not so little actually yeah we're gonna scoop it right up with some of that yeah yeah yep most of that's a big old diamond that was in there with a little bit of the resin on it so we're gonna put that right in the banger and we're gonna get that email fired up and eating we're gonna tear into this sativa get my day going little one's down for a nap the oldest is at the in-laws for the day actually she's gonna spend the night and uh i'm just gonna veg out i'm gonna hang out with the wife uh we're gonna watch a little tv i've got a ham i'm cooking in the oven with a cherry coke glaze a little bit of brown sugar and um we got some sweet corn from the in-laws uh farm uh the white silver queen sweet corn super good oh and then i'm gonna do some homemade mashed potatoes and i'm just doing a ham dinner for the wife tonight we're just gonna enjoy it um really not a whole lot going on i just kind of want to relax i've had a rough week rough couple weeks but yeah my anxiety has been through the roof especially going back to work at the job i don't want to be at i have not heard any more on my dispensary application no not even so much the courtesy of a phone call which you know that's kind of expected at this point what i'm seeing with a lot of things in the industry i i noticed that they took over 100 applications for both of the positions and they just let the job opening expire on the website that they were using to hire through i think it was indeed but they let the job expire it didn't even tell indeed if they've got somebody hired or not they even said indeed even said to me hey they let this expire with no explanation both positions and i could see they had like 140 applicants for one of them and i get that but a phone call at least i mean it's been a couple weeks even just to say hey we're not interested but thanks anyway i'd appreciate something like that you know that's just you know good customer service in any industry [Music] oh yeah hmm that's got a nice flavor to it a little earthy grassy a little piney hmm this is good i like the flavor rhythm never usually disappoints they're just so [ __ ] expensive oh yep definitely good sour diesel got the dab sweat starting already i can already feel the buzz in my head like my face i'm starting to feel a little yeah one dab that's nice that's really good [Music] oh it is smooth maybe a little bit of throat burn tiny yes i know i'm being bad i'm drinking a soda but to be fair i have cut way back drinking a lot more bottled water a lot more iced tea i'm still got my cup of coffee here from this morning i've only got about half drink i'm gonna have to warm it back up but i used to drink three four of those a day and i drink one a day if i even drink coffee at all so and that's i love my coffee but it's just such a hassle sometimes i have a keurig i can either do one cup in various sizes or i can brew a carafe i have a pot that goes on to it but i don't use it a lot because you have to clean i don't i will not buy k-cups i will not because they're terrible for the environment and i figured we already do enough horrible [ __ ] in the environment a non-recyclable plastic thing that i have to throw away every time so what i do is i have that make your own where you buy whatever coffee you want you just fill it stick it in dump out your grounds clean it out and go again just sometimes that's too tedious for me i just don't want with it i don't want to have the time for it or i don't have the time for it and i don't want to mess with it so occasionally my oldest daughter will surprise me and she'll make me a cup of coffee in the morning which is pretty awesome other times my wife just surprised me and puts money on my dunkin card and i can log into the app and order on the go or if i'm at work i can go to their drive-through at that place um because in the town that i work there duncan has a drive-through so either way you know i'm just not drinking as much caffeine as i was i'm cutting way back on the sugar i'm trying uh desperately to cut back on fast food as much as possible um this this dvt cloth thing scared the [ __ ] out of me i'm not gonna lie to you so i'm very mindful now of anything uh odd about my body the way i feel so i'm trying to eat healthier i've already lost 20 pounds since this journey started a year ago in october um yes we're coming up on a year on the channel halloween eve is one year to the day i did my first video so um we'll do something then too some cool videos something special some fun some stupid who knows but anyway as i was saying it's just i've lost 20 pounds in the last year um mainly because i'm more active getting out more because of the cannabis i'm more social less anxious so more likely and more inclined to go out to the real world and enjoy things so uh that's nice i want to keep that up i want to keep that momentum going so now i'm trying to eat even better eat healthier exercise but not push it because i can't do that right i can't really push it like i used to especially getting my heart rate up right now it's just not really the best idea i gotta i gotta do things in moderation so this is really a lesson in patience for me as well um and that's tough for me i'm not gonna lie i'm not the most patient individual all right uh i need a terp i need a terp wipe i gotta clean out my banger and then we're gonna go in for another dab i got a little distracted with my discussion of health and work and whatnot but uh well let's not forget we are here for a review so with that said my first thoughts are this sour diesel is uh while not the most uh highest and potent in thc the effects are pretty damn good i mean one dab and i'm already getting un focused from my original discussion and on to a tangent so now the wife is yelling at me that the timer's going off on the ham for the mid range just turn the timer off i'll get there in a minute it's still got like 20 25 minutes it was just a timer to kind of remind me to that it's there and cooking okay so i get distracted because you know why would i get distracted what could possibly be [Laughter] i'm an ass god bless her and her patients i don't know how she's put up with me for 13 years i really don't especially because she's sober 100 in every way no pharmaceuticals no drinking no smoking no medication no cancer nothing she just no coffee even she doesn't even drink that uh the only thing she does do is soda that's her one vice that in oreos other than that no god bless her she's she's a strong person she works full-time she goes to school full-time she puts up with my [ __ ] [Laughter] oh [ __ ] so yes my first thoughts on this sour diesel are that they are this is really good um it's like crackly pissed that will piss me off if there's a crack in that already i don't know how that happened but okay no crack just some it just looked that way it's a line in my reclaim um weird anyway it's heating back up we're going in for dab number two and then i should be thoroughly [ __ ] up for the day sunday [ __ ] fun day right i'm gonna chill out in the pool maybe work on my lawnmower it's got a blown coil and i gotta i gotta take it off i just haven't gotten around to it it's four bolts to get to it and i just haven't felt like this but it's sitting there with the top open and everything's there just i haven't felt like doing it but it's got to be done i got to mow the lawn within the next week before it gets too much [ __ ] happens right oh we're almost at the temperature almost up the temperature i'm ready i'm ready i am ready so hopefully you guys had a good weekend uh hopefully you're staying medicated you're keeping busy getting projects done enjoying family time whatever it is hopefully it's going well hopefully you guys aren't uh having any issues and dramas to the minimum ah we're up to temp cheers really tastes good [Music] yes please but uh oh flavor's good the effects are nice it's just got to come down in price it's got to be 65 or less i don't care how good the terps are it was 80 85 100 grams gotta [ __ ] stop and if i'm bitching think about the poor folks that don't have uh regular incomes they're on unemployment or they're on worse disability ssi disability you know retired medicare medicaid they got nothing coming in they're on a set fixed income and they've got all these bills now they're going to try to afford your crap which is i should say crap you're trying to pay your crap prices for your amazing product it's just got to stop the greed above all it's got to stop because you can call it what you want you you try to [ __ ] what it is it's always this you can't tell me you haven't recouped the cost i'm not stupid i can do basic math the profit margins are insane i don't care what you say they're crazy and you could still lower your prices a lot and make a ridiculous amount you just won't or don't want to but with that said this stuff is outstanding i absolutely love the flavor the effects are great i feel good i'm feisty today i'm feeling feisty it's got me motivated i've been kind of laid back and being taking it easy and being a bit of a pacifist uh and letting people just give me [ __ ] and walk on me lately and that's gonna stop um i've hit a level of [ __ ] that's way up to here so which is the way it is i'm not tolerating it anymore i'm gonna stop putting up with [ __ ] i have no problem being nice and i like i like it it's been great all the interaction but there's a few things that have just and i'm

today I'm going to be reviewing this pristiq batter I bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very huge all right here's to sampling it if you're under 18 years old please click out of this video this video is only intended for viewers who are 18 plus years old I live in a legal medical state so I'm a lot to do this I do not condone illegal activities don't do anything illegal Cheers I'm gonna taste this [Music] guys an ant happened to stumbled and landed on the tip of my dapper and somehow he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's the purple punch by pristiq they're better thank you guys so much for watching this video this channel is all about educating and

good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and we're back here for another video guys it's just another chill-ass day it's actually nice and bright today it's actually pretty warm compared to the last couple days where it's just been cold and rainy and stuff um i'm out here in california but today guys man we're um this week has just been a budget week i bought a whole bunch of budget cards so your boy is doing budget cart reviews today so today i got a honey leaf and i'm trying this [ __ ] so you guys don't have to man but um honey leaves they're pretty cheap distillate but i've heard they're pretty good and i've never tried one or at least i've tried one but i've never tried one on the channel i've only tried them like you know in passing one of the homies had one so you know i ended up buying it but i got the northern lights and um it has 92 percent thc it's pretty freaking high in thc but that's a given with the distillate and it has 2.26 cbd guys so your boy we got the ursa bat today shout out to um ursa extracts i came home today and i got two packages um one from ursa x-straps and one from another company they sent me a gravity bomb but shout out to ursa extracts i love the lanyards because i love wearing a battery around my neck you feel me if i ever get big you know i won't have a chain your boy's gonna have lanyards with like different cards like different lanyards with different carts on it feel me so let's open this baby up and let's get into it [Music] like i'm not a big dislike fans but these carts are like 20 bucks 15 20 bucks a gram so when you hear that price you're just like huh should i try it should i try is it worth it do you guys think it's worth it so let's check it out see what it looks like [Music] the oil looks actually looks pretty good i'm not going to get a super close up but you guys can see it it's like a super gold color um darker than raw garden darker than a lot of distillate cards too in my opinion um but let's put it on [Music] and it looks like it's just in like some cheap cars not in an avd card or c cell it doesn't even have a name so you know you gotta watch out for those type of cards guys with either c cell or avd avd cards or one of the cards or any type of ceramic um but avd is um one of the big brands that are kind of dropping their carts and they have ceramic coils inside of them so they look like a normal sea cell but inside they actually have ceramic coils but shout out to ursa extracts man they got a full ceramic cart that's crazy so we might have to get pick up some ursa extract soon a strain that i haven't tried yet or something so cheers guys we're gonna take a rip of this northern lights it's not bad [Music] it's not bad but it's also you know not my type of flavor like it just tastes too much like it doesn't taste like they put any kind of terpenes or anything in it sorry i'm trying to get a fat rip i have it on red on this battery but if you guys don't know ursa strikes batteries uh they only go up to 2.0 voltage so sorry if it doesn't look like i'm hitting it but i'm actually i'm hitting this [Music] [Music] but this is good i guess if you're on a budget you need this lit but it's not the best distillate i don't know if it's just the terpenes they put in it or it's just because they barely put any terpenes or anything flavor but i don't know it just tastes like like basic distillate if you guys ever um had friends who just had a jar distillate and you ever just took in a dab or smoked a little bit of this religious straight distillate you guys kind of know it kind of tastes like that in a way [Music] man i gotta take super heavy hits to get nice hits off of this ursa battery but i do like the ursa battery but yeah guys man i don't know if i like this i would give this cart a rating like six six out of ten just because i would buy this if i was on a budget and this is all i could buy to get me through you know a couple weeks but i would rather go for a raw garden or a stizzy type distillate or any other this one's not as good like i think papa herbs is better than this one i would say papa herbs distill it is way [Music] better but yeah guys man today is just a chill day i just got back from work got some hennessy coming because if you guys don't know on saturday nights i like to drink a little bit of hennessy and smoke a bit with you guys a live stream and this saturday we might even be able to throw some gaming in there a little bit because i finally got fortnite and i finally have cold war on my computer so we probably could play some games too also if we wanted to you know shout out to all the people that are in the live stream man the live streams are actually starting to get a little more fun than the freaking the vlogs man i like the live streams actually um so i'm gonna start going live stream way more often guys um but i'm also doing more reviews i still haven't even tried um that noose dizzy strain that came out i bought i bought it and i just haven't even tried that out yet and i feel like everyone's trying but i'm gonna try that out and probably do like a wake and bake or story time but during the week it's kind of hard to like you know get out and do those types of vlogs because i'm just working but um yeah we're just trying the honey leaf guys man let me know if you guys ever tried honey leaves this is the northern lights 92 percent thc in this it's not bad i'd give it like a six but it's definitely not you know the best quality you know like if you're gonna choose a cheap cart just get a pop of herbs it's cheaper and it tastes better just tastes way better but shout out to everybody that made it this far in the vlog man don't forget to like comment subscribe more vlogs to come i just wanted to give you guys my opinion on this freaking cart but yeah guys more vlogs coming soon don't forget to keep watching guys and let me know if you guys have any suggestion on videos too i'm always open for suggestions and sorry if i don't do the cards that some of you guys suggest is just some of the cards that some of you guys suggest is hard to find and if you guys were on the live stream last night you guys know that i live in a city where they don't have storefronts so i have to drive 30 minutes to go to actual storefront so most of the stuff that i buy is delivery so if the delivery places don't have them i usually can't get them um just because i'm just not trying to drive

show and with that being said this content and I'm not intended for children's if you aren't on YouTube under the age of 13 you know even posed to be on it anyway anyways we're your parents hat so um here's some news so they sign a Donald Trump signed the executive order making it so that you have to be 21 to purchase tobacco or vaping products which i think is totally fine so you have to be 21 to buy tobacco or vapes you have to be 21 to flip to gamble you have to be 21 to drink and you don't have to be 21 to join the army and go get kilt so remember that and here we go so we're gonna be doing a glow review and I got a couple of a couple of glows to review this time we got some Callie gold and some Elliot ultra let me know what you know think about what's going on with the vaping and all everything that's going on in the comment section below and that would be totally awesome Aaron I know you're gonna check out the vid so I definitely wanna give you a shower I appreciate that brother and here we go this is Callie gold oh let's go so Kelly go says relaxation bars max depression relief asthmatics pain relief is maxed happiness is relaxed insomnia relief it's max and that sounds awesome is if this can put me to sleep that would be just the best it says oh any my magnifying glass 92 1.8 as usual smells really good it definitely has a very earthy herbal aroma not really candied or sweet have you tried Glo extract singing of you guys out there or gals let me know what you think of them I'm gonna be starting this off my tank off at 6.5 and see how we go from there here we go this is a Kelly go it's max - just so you know if Joe definitely tastes good turn it down another notch or two because I found that these Kelly goals are a little bit different than the tanks they don't need a higher temperature the bernam so anything both certain temperature just Lisl without the taste any work and more tea fans out there shout out your boss Rick and Morty quo or catchphrase in the comment section below I am a huge lubba dub dub fan with consent all right so I'm wailing on it it's the yummy it's really good I like that one so that is Kelly go I think the one that I liked that was least light was the it was the cushy Dalek I I liked it but Margaret was not a fan so she hated it as you guys see Eddie Murphy on SNL the last night that Yuri praised his old and I'm old so I remember when Eddie Murphy like before he did all that Nutty Professor and just trash not trash but like more towards kids and he used to be way hardcore and he did hardcore it last night and it was awesome sorry about that I think I kiss new phone will be doing a video on that so the other one is la ultra that reminds me yeah I just got I just got a new phone today it is called a I can't pronounce it I'll tell you about that when I get the box it's got a lot of vowels in it but it's super huge just got like a 6.8 screen and we'll see how the video comes out a little bit later so this is la ultra indica says you know it 92 1.8 let's see it says relaxation is max stress relief is just shy of being max pain relief is more than halfway which is always awesome happiness is full barred and then it says euphoria is maxed out so let's go a little more heat on that again this content is not intended for children so if you're watching this and you or a child beat it go watch telly tell these or something Blue's Clues paw Patrol or something like that oh no scram oh this one this one is compared to Kelly couch this one is much lighter ooh so like oh that's so good so this one's much more it has a lighter elements a fragrance but it's definitely a lighter vape then be Kelly got this so I would compare the other one it's more dinky skunky and this one's more Christmassy tree yeah there you go one more Christmas tree flavor you know what I'm talking about so Oh make sure you like comment share subscribe ring the bell a couple more videos coming at you later tonight I will be doing an unboxing for the phone I'm recording on so we can talk about that because it's really cool and if I'm correct it'll be the first phone I owned where I can play fortnight on it and that's just

"man ain't in Rome okay we've waited from the earth God put this here for me and you [ __ ] out I'm skinny Phipps Oh what you got it's good guys G hair C T weavers it's a like next week it's following me it's not last week it's this week right now it's not last week it's currently this week so it's not on the healing corner and uh new meds are coming in so we got some new meds this week I'm all about trying new [ __ ] I mean obviously this week I am but this week I'm definitely getting some new stuff I picked up a strain that was already been down to healing corner not for about a week now and I slept on it and I don't know why stuff I mean I noticed a lot of patients are actually slept on it so I'm bringing to you guys fresh specs I'd definitely check it out it's a strain from thier plant that's down there you probably didn't know what it was but down there right now is the ultrasound yeah that's like the ultrasound three paces that donald ultrasound is it's a super super super super salary strain it's an indica heavy hitting couch lacking indica it's super sour and some MKULTRA crossed with the East Coast Sour Diesel so the MKULTRA across the issue of Sour Diesel got the ultrasound I got that in the bag here we're gonna it medicated I'm that tonight I got the UM they have a new rig out here that I've had that I actually cleaned up nice so loose Lamar thinks little ball and gets particularly the bong hits and I want to give you guys a heads up also coming down this week at the healing corner there's a bunch of new meds coming out from from a third plant I think you're at least dropping off a couple things advanced scrubs just come out with [ __ ] some bomb-ass crumble 94 percent THC crumble indica the other half groovy strain or the mailman wherever you prefer to a call but SEF GUI strain that's gonna be coming out on Thursday also I'm picking up a new metal from advanced girl labs um it's this chocolate hazelnut cookie I think I got a special order down the incline I have no fish stock down but they asked them come to me and pick a batch of that and so let me bring that metal bull review and on the crumble review also would probably pop off a [ __ ] ah an old pan cartridge review and possibly even you know maybe one of those pill reviews I don't know but I'm about bringing reviews all week this week fresh so every day I'm doing today I'm probably doing tomorrow the next day whatever pop poppin full reviews there's let me shut the [ __ ] up and get their medications right in the bag tonight hey tonight we only get one string it's the ultra sour but that's all I've been thinking all day I'm [ __ ] super psyched about getting sour when we get my sour on I did of course pick up a couple of uh the advance girl labs into court cookies cuz these just the bottom they really do help you sleep at night so patience if you haven't tried those yet I highly recommend getting these again they're the in decor 20 milligram chocolate chip cookies from advance club's great night time medication I have huge sleeping issues and those seem to just get the damn thing done so that's awesome and then uh this is just some stuff that work and then I here it is so this is a third plane what they call it is this sea Fairplay saturate cetera no cetera now that you know anyways it's an Endicott and as you can see on the numbers on it I think it's AI like 22 percent and change THC um yeah THC 8.55 and gg8 21.2 so you have twenty one and three quarters percent THC against MKULTRA across the East Coast Sour Diesel and I and I've been looking forward to a billion because cuz I've been doing the chromophore like the past couple days and then what else did I get after that follow the strawberry cloth another fire sativa but then straight Stephen L in Amy I like in because let's see what's up okay it doesn't honestly Blache in a facial like a sour smelling actually has more of a I don't seem saying like a sweet smell mmm bad someone he's beneath a solid cuz your burn your nose like you're feeling got that ammonia me smell at all it's got more of a Swedish smell mmm almost like a sweet tea smell smells like Asik is sweet not like sweet tea but like it's sweet and it's got like a tea that grunts mom mmm smells good let's go real good okay so let's see what you got we picked up an eighth that's nice as know they're then bus not some bigger nose they're from Hill and uh feeling perform up there plant a couple of the growers I've noticed the nose you get a little bit bigger so that's cool and this strain is pretty economically pressing it's like 40 40 bucks or 45 bucks for the eighth down to UM the healing corner so that's definitely what's up and what you see let's look at this I mean for Connecticut that's a good size not yet okay very nice okay so let's get some good footage of this let's see we got as you go in you can definitely see a lot with trichomes take a look they're all over it very modern and covered in trichomes it actually looks really really nice it was really really nice look at that and then well you can look at that piece right there I've only gone to a couple these buds they're all really really nice I can do that that's nice it's hard to pick one out of here there's that big bud the smell then we got stank coming off the table there's a stank and it's hard to describe the stank it's like a sweet sour smell like it really is the trikes oops Billy attracts guys this sweet sour smell reading off the table okay so that's nice have a smoke on there's a couple there I saw it looks real nice I think it was that one that know we'll find it where was it I think that won't look good yeah we're definitely a Medicaid on that yeah it's much cuter than that let's find that here's that okay then we'll need like one little one to go with it mm-hmm how's that looking wait here the two big that's kind of big hey there we are right up here okay take this little guy still plenty try clunker again little end pieces I personally like to smoke my buds they said before from smallest the biggest and the reason I do that is because that way when you get towards the end of the medication it's just that much better like basically every time you take medication either your bottle of your bag you're gonna get better medication the last time because you're gonna get the nice nuts so I find that that system actually works out quite well for me because all the medication is fire and then it just it's like it just let's try it try for yourself you big hello that's great I just find it a good way to use up medication go from small to big or like least attractive to a most attractive sometimes I mean I'm the reviews sometimes I grab a nice and hugging stuff just as a review but still evenly do there in views here I try to got the smaller pieces just so as I go down on my medication leave my older medications I'm just sitting on when I go into the jars boom huge knives like so it's awesome nice let's break these up when you get in mmm Tony okay I'm a big tea drinker with had teas that smell very similar to this very similar those are cannabis free teas too but the buds are little dense break them up you got thats already smells lettin you got some sec right no it's a a weed on my nose um I may have underestimated well weed we need my new a little bit more for two balls we'll see maybe not maybe maybe alright all right so they're gonna [ __ ] sweat you think this [ __ ] off he's [ __ ] Christ [ __ ] look up alright so get the ball packed up here oh yeah well get two bowls out of us definitely definitely so what the hairnet wow I was a dumbass and I just [ __ ] grabbed my row which is covered in dog hair so now I gotta Ford all dogs ever read dog hair and weed sucks you know you're hearing it I gotta be very careful with that next ball make sure I'll get hammer wheat hay so we got the ball loaded that was a process right holy [ __ ] obviously need to medicate alright let's hear Matt EKGs Gavilan take a way to win to the patient's time feel that [ __ ] to do and things to see alright so ultra sour again the MK ULTRA across the East Coast Sour Diesel I'm excited about this I uh [ __ ] [ __ ] I'll remember let me tell you a sign I [ __ ] forgot anyways there's need to medicate the arm that crumble it's coming out on Thursday that's give me to buy super bang I was thinking about Jenna um a seaweedy characters from my open what do you think I get a CVT cartridge this week do see be really authentic arches I was really thinking other than I haven't had a CVT cartridge after to open it's been a minute since I've had some CVT in my life so I could use some so I think I'm gonna get moved don't you guys think I think that's a good idea

let's see how sour this really team start is show hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view by the way you should sub to juvenile styles this channel is really dope now enjoy the video what's up world i got edison limelight ultra sour cush strain from nslc so i'm going to do a little review of it i've done it before but back when i was uh i always say i guess a little cringy and less uh experienced i guess we'll say so now that i'm a little better a little less stiff and i thought i'd give another few so i'm going to give you guys a nice close-up of this and then when i get when the close-up's finished i'll be back with the joint rolled up so check this out because we're down we light this up and light this up in a cup i can't stand up be a cyber monkey like the end of the part i get twist up keep your lips shut [Music] don't [Music] [Music] so i'm back i got the bat let's light it up and get high as my hat but it might not be that high but anyways let's light this [ __ ] up it does have the nice sour taste to it that i was expecting i mean how can you not limelight ultra sour so i'm wondering if because when i went and bought it it actually just said limelight so if it's the limelight must be part of the i don't know part of the company edison limelight ultra sour because i know ultra sour is a strain i've had before too so is it limelight or ultra sour it's a little confusing either way it is a sativa and it's 22 percent thc and it's not a bad grab as you can see it's a very nice like light green color it has some really nice colored hair on it has a lot of crystal too so and that's not a bad account for a gram so we still got this after having the joint so that's definitely not a bad gram from the liquor store and it was nine 9.78 or something like that so that's not a bad price for a gram so what i'll do is i'll throw a nice little piece up into the bong we'll taste it in the bun and then we'll rate the taste and then the smell in account everything else so let me pat a little bowl there we go as you can see we've got a nice little bit up in there let's take a hit hold on the hole's clogged a little bit i should have poked it through first oh god i'm gonna have to poke this first my bad there we should be good now maybe a little too good oh that was a nice day i wasn't expecting that you can see those little birds floating around my head [Music] i'm just playing but it tasted nice so that's all it counted besides it made me feel nice so yeah um i'll give the rating for the taste i'll give it a four oh no i'll give it a 3.5 i give it a 4 if you really like this sour strains but i have a 3.5 for flavor it's pretty nice flavor for rating for a pound for the gram it's not a bad gram at all especially from the liquor store they can look a little stingy sometimes so i say i'll give the account i give the account a three and a half as well it's not a bad account looks like a decent amount for a gram maybe i should start weighing them up for you guys on the reviews i might start doing that the next couple reviews weighing it and seeing how much it weighs compared to what it's supposed to be i might start doing that so i think that we'll give the limelight or the ultra sour the limelight ultra sour will give it an overall rating of 3.5 pretty good we pretty good ground but it's obviously just mediocre it's not top-notch but for the price it's a pretty good ground so that's where this one's from the liquor store it's the nslc here and i've had a few other strains from the edison cannabis co they're not too bad at all they have some pretty good strains so yeah i'll give an overall rating 3.5 to that and if you watch my videos i want to start intro and true interviewing like pop photographers and different kind of like weed influencers any kind of weak content creator so if you puff and record stuff hit me up and maybe we can set up an interview be pretty dope so with that i guess i'll leave it there i still got the stickers for juvenile styles if you want one hit me up in the comments or at me on twitter of my twitter in the description or send me an email at juvenilestylesgmail.com with that i'll leave it there

out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be

back with another another epic epic episode all right boys been a while we're doing the harvest smoke report bud report of the amherst sour diesel from 8 or so we just grew and will give you my thoughts on it let you know what i think about the chronic so four different phenols um all different all different smells all different type of [ __ ] and let's get into it right now so we got one job right here this is fido number two all right fino number two chrisley as hell bam what's that but right okay speedo number two now final number two as a very musky muskie let's get us off the bat first if we go any further right before we go any further let's get off the bat this it has no sour it's just maybe diesel it's not sour it's not the california new york sour diesel vancouver sour diesel that we know man this is not it this is you know it smells it's not sour it's not sour like eats pinot has a different taste right so let's get into it right so this is number two let's see if you know number two very crystally this one we burn it this one has a very classically cushy diesely skunky smell you know what i mean um no sour this is probably my favorite vino out of before right here's another bud let's get another bud funeral number two going very nice um crystal structures right yeah so it has a lot of fruitiness in this tool this is another female number two let's get another butt out here you guys check it out so a cushy musky fruity skunky smell and you can smell some diesel but i'm not gonna say it's sour it's not sour it's not sour at all and i got some nice-sized nuggies in this batch for sure right very crystally damn that's nice right all right funeral number one is my least favorite one uh wasn't even i don't i don't rate this one at all uh this one's okay i might just turn funeral number one to some right let's turn that into some hash all right final number three this is the smelliest version of them all very [ __ ] potent terpene um second favorite second favorite let's get a butt out um there's some big buds i don't want to [ __ ] yeah this one has very it's just a pungent sweet skunky smell it's not sour it's very pungent and sweet um very punchy and sweet um very sticky [ __ ] i don't know bro all right so that's that one this was the leafiest of them all right this was the leafiest of them all um and then we got fetal number four uh which is okay it was all right this one this one has a real spicy aroma to it right it's very spicy um i don't know it was all right it wasn't this was my last favorite tool this is number one not really digging it too much it smells like curry this one has a [ __ ] curry smell to it bro you know what i mean this one has like a like a curry [ __ ] smell to it it's very spicy it has some lemon in there i could smell some [ __ ] lemon and [ __ ] lemony and and curry bro as i smell i smell [ __ ] curry off that [ __ ] though you know what i mean there's another big bud of that one fetal number four which is yeah man i smell like [ __ ] tumeric and [ __ ] like masala curry and [ __ ] bro you know what i mean but then again my favorite one again number one you can see the difference in the bud from number one to those guys right number one is just like so crystally if i was going to keep any of these strains it's definitely going to be number number two this one here right these ones here right these ones are the [ __ ] bomb ass ghostly [ __ ] [ __ ] right oh that [ __ ] if i was going to keep a keeper off this this diesel is definitely going to be the number two um banging out here um then maybe the three the three taste is really nice um skunky and gassy sweet gas um on that one right so overall overall with with the diesel now or the weight okay four plants i got you know like a quarter pound of each of them you know what i mean uh of each plant a little over a quarter pound so you know what i mean for four plants you gain up a pound and a half i weighed myself out at uh some of the jars already empty [ __ ] like that man you know what i mean the conor rate is just what's left right uh curing up and just airing it out now i've got the beetle packs in there and i'm in so yeah would i grow this again nah i [ __ ] probably won't you know they tricked me uh probably gonna be done with hso for a while because you know what i mean um this is not sour uh diesel this is uh amherst it's like a this is probably the european version right this is european but it's not california new york diesel or even the one we got here in canada like we got some bomb vancouver and toronto sour that's [ __ ] sour and skunky and fuel right this is more fruity gas and a little skunk and a little muss you know what i mean if anything i would grow this guy you know number two again that was definitely my favorite pheno you know what i mean it's just more crystally and just was a better smoke overall right um but you know um that's how the story goes right you experiment with strings and you know i'm probably done with hso for a while i'm not really impressed with this one it was a good smoking thing right their chem dog wasn't even a real chem dog it was more piney it wasn't it wasn't chem dog it didn't have that kim funk on it so again again you know i'm done with hso for a while and i got a surprise um right now i got a surprise coming up right now so let's uh let's check that out all right peace uh hold on a second i'm gonna show you what i got in the tent all right back in the tent we got some og kush you know what me and this is the og kush for like years ago 10 11 12 year ago og kush you know what i mean and um private reserve you know and we just got this is this is two weeks i'm vegging man these are these these are doing great man these are these are two weeks veg they're [ __ ] getting tall i'm going to start bending them i want to bend them from here from here i'm going to bend these over you know what i mean and uh yeah we'll see how that goes right let's start bending these these plants over and uh see this up man so this is this is what i'm saying this is the og kush i grew this before years ago get it back again now this is the funk this is the skunk this is the the chem this is the sour og kush version we're gonna check these ones out right and um i already filmed there you see i've filmed the top so i found them already i'm gonna start and i'm bending them over and we're going to see how that goes all right peeps um yeah just look for the updates man it's been great uh sour diesel done not sure if we're going to grow that again og kush up front and um yeah we're going to see how this goes this one's the bomb grown this for years before so let's check this one out all right peace um i'm going to be out of here on the ellis tear i'm going to show you how that looks and um yeah yeah man we check it out all right mozberg 420 it's a good thing", "CuVgKq5OkZw": "okay guys or uh back again with a heavy hitters so this one's a bubba kush they're calling it an indica and it definitely is more in because than anything else but I don't know they could almost call it a hybrid because you definitely get that head rush and and there's even like a lemony undertone to the taste but generally the effects are indica dominant more of a body high and it's interesting to see the testing numbers on this I think it's almost the lowest THC but it definitely isn't on the bottom of the scale as far as effects are concerned for me I mean I like it better than me better than that Orange Crush which was like you know two or three percent higher on the THC I definitely like this Bubba cush better so yeah it definitely tastes like a but Kush is that real life I don't know earth-tone cush flavor coming through with like I said that like aftertaste of lemons yeah definitely in the dominant you can see though Carter still looks the same I heard there's a different different type of cartridge out there so looking forward to trying that out when it comes along as you can see with these bubbles I mean it's just crazy thick I have it should be the concentrate and there should be thicket here if it's not it's generally got terpenes added to it that aren't cannabis derived pants you can got that like fuelie flavor to it as well it's probably more prominent than the lemon it's taste like that old-school Bella oh yeah they did a really good job on this one as always it's got that at testing in the batch number you can go look up on on their website and it's from a reputable lab that steep hill ABS same packaging were used to and I just wanted to give you guys a look at that one so there you go that's a public push from heavy hitters starting to see these go down in price too so hopefully that continues through through the changes here in January so we'll see stay tuned for more and thanks thanks for watching I hope you liked it", "3xEsfKQg2Cg": "[Music] [Music] [Applause]

affiliated with any canvas producers or extraction companies in any way and today I've got some West Coast extracts Hanna lope that's one of my favorite strains I've done a lot of cantaloupes in the past but quick overview on the packaging here so West Coast extracts on the front refine hydrocarbon extract one gram it says it's a sativa and nineteen plus keep out of reach of children west coast extracts 4.0 on Instagram and I don't know if you can see that a little bit of gold on my fingers on the label which I'm not oh let's have a look inside so alright I'm real careful with touching this because I'm getting gold all over my fingers alright just a little slip of parchment Oh [ __ ] gorgeous color on that though that a nice little bendy slab looks like I might have a little bit of a smell Oh No look that just bends and pulse that's [ __ ] gorgeous looking first impressions on the extract super posits check a point in the dish here without touching it with my gold dust fingers all right see how it goes ah super mellow flavor nice kick to the back of the throat got that Oh signature cantaloupe Cana sweet Mel any flavor to it oh no nasty colors in the bottom of the bucket all right so it's been about 15 minutes since I did that damn and and I mentioned right off the bat that color in the bottom of the buckets super nice really nice mellow sweet Melanie flavor I really like cantaloupe that's one of my I mentioned before it's one of my favorite strains I'm feeling pretty couch locked for a sativa though you know pretty good I could you know socialize and and do stuff I guess folks things kind of hard ya know great great product I don't normally talk about my dispensary experience in these things here but I did purchase this locally here and I went in with a friend of mine and we both purchased the exact same product the single gram cantaloupe and I paid $10 more which was kind of unsettling and off-putting and so there was that and the other thing I wanted to mention was the gold print on the packaging all of my fingers did not like that I don't really feel like dabbing gold ink print so if you do purchase that careful or like you know wash your hands after you open the Myakka doing kind of thing if you care about that kind of thing so overall great product and I would I would dab it again but I would be wary of purchasing it and its packaging", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "-ObpIP0JzzM": "all right everybody back with another one of my favorites has it got to be the strongest one the strongest brand on the market I've ever tried all right another heavy dinners this one candy apple it's a hybrid I didn't look up the strain info on this one but boy does it taste like apples it's wild it's like just as distinct is that that strawberry strawberry cough I mean tastes like strawberry this tastes like apples it's like a sweet sweet and sour kind of Apple taste and once again they had the testing on the back here from from steep hill Babs along with the website 80 percent total cannabinoids 85 yeah 85 percent THC this is way up there and once again you can definitely tell just by the viscosity of this stuff thickness what's in there it's not all runny like most of them that really water down there concentrate with non cannabis derived terpenes these guys seem to just put it in there with you know just enough just enough of the consistency that I can run into the cartridge yeah on the inhale it's like totally sour apple and then on the exhale it's kind of turned into a sweet apple aftertaste and it's a hybrid but it's definitely more on the sativa side of things so yeah it's a good good one for during the day you can see how slow that those air bubbles are going up I'm gonna give you an idea how thick it is and I mean they stock too they didn't even get all the way to the column none of the other ones do that and in my opinion none of the other ones are as strong as these guys man that taste on this is just amazing I mean you can tell it's not it's not fake it's not like some weird added flavor it still got this cannabis reminiscent taste to it but boy the apple flavor is just crazy I've never tasted anything like that same thing with that Strawberry Cough I'm not sure if this is another DNA genetics strain I think Strawberry Cough is but once again heavy hitters about those of themselves over this candy apple and truly tastes like a like a candy apple it's a little backwards cuz you get the sweet after this hour whereas candy apples covered in caramel see it's a sweet first for this one and tall the sour apple first and finishes sweet but uh there you go thanks for watching guys I hope you liked it and feel free to ask any questions below I try to answer any of them so there you go thanks for watching see you next time", "aYGa_Ns0vHQ": "[Music] uh all right youtube y'all know what time it is we're about to press

always right stay medicated these guys", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "PKh4K_D-xnE": "hey everyone welcome to greenbox the read unboxing channel today we've got some ultra sour i'm namaste it's got 21 percent THC and 0% CBD and then this was packed on April 2nd 2020 [Music] I could have like a citrusy sweet sour smell to it so 3.45 that's like yeah a sour but sweet smell it's pretty citrusy as well and the buds are pretty firm but like they feel like they're a good moisture solid but still spongy it's like a good layer of crystal on some of these there's not a ton of hairs though it's just like home today few kind of pale tan colored hairs and then for leaf color it's like a medium green and fairly small bud size pretty fluffy what's a crystal ground up a lot more finer than I expected but I think that has more to do with the Buster that we're using now so ultra sour from nameste is a nice string by the hits were fairly citrusy tasting and then nugs themself smelt pretty lemony sour like sweet smelling definitely a nice strain for me it was more of an uplifting productive happy high definitely give it a try and let us know your experience in the comments below like and subscribe and we'll see you next time thanks for watching", "mBA7TD7pFTk": "well outright outright all right let's welcome back with the first time growth this is once again yet another harvest so with this harvest right now we got some Sour Diesel strains in the tent we also got some OG Kush this thing is very potent very powerful smoke really helps you get a good night's sleep at night and once again we got the Green crack I bought this plant because it was really high demand the dispensary is where I live and it's really good I got to admit I like this plan also so we got the Giga bud plant once again and Giga bud is a good plant but it grows funny and I don't think I'm gonna be keeping this one so and the last plant is candy cane which has become one of my favorites for tasting and enrollment and smells this thing is just absolutely lovely now check it out these plants at the end of week 8 I have been keeping them in darkness and they're still in darkness right now and while they're drying so right now before we cut them all down we got to mark these plants we got to put the coat hangers because we cut them right at the base and then we hang the whole plant upside down this thing helps me a lot it saves time the foliated all these 11 plants right here took me and the wife approximately three hours so yeah three hours is a long time you really do want to get help so thankfully I have a nice beautiful wife that helps me do this stuff so here you go with the night shots these plants are finely cut they're hanging upside down and it's really beautiful look at them alright now eleven plants drawing you don't want to keep them all so close because you don't want to get them to get moldy and stuff like that so you try to let them breathe I did turn off my fan because when I didn't turn off my fan my last harvest I did notice that they were drying out a lot too quick and then up with really really dry weed which is not something I liked so yeah so the fans off right now no light has been on while these things have been drawing and I gotta admit this is probably going to be a really good harvest and it does look like it's gonna be over a pound now hanging plants upside down some people say it originated by bats who's to say I mean some people say yes some people say no but in the end we don't really quite know if bats taught us how to hang the plants upside down but in my opinion they really did they honest well alright so now that we got that out of the way I mean just take a look at one of the plants that I cut down and this thing pretty much took me about 45 minutes to trim anyways very beautiful sort about this time you know I always post on how much I harvested from my harvest I always try to aim for a pound but before we do this check it out the bags of shake at the bottom that's from all the trim that I have I really never add that to the harvest weight because it's just stuff routable so check it out right here there we got the Sour Diesel and here we got the green crock let's just try to see what the green crack one looks like just try to get a close-up right there and the green crack very good smoke very high buzz and and it's pretty good and then here we got my og cush this is one of my favorites it's a good high actually puts you down it's a good time to have before bed or maybe just have it at work that's pretty much what I do and then here you go we got some OG Kush here and here we got the candy cane now with the candy cane I really love this plant this plant really does taste good and really does gives you like a sativa type buzz it's really good and I'm deciding this is a keeper I'm always gonna clone it and always gonna have it now this is the giga but this gigabyte plant grows really weird and I'm not going to keep it around we're done with the giga bud we're not gonna go any more but it is a good smoke alright so now it's time for the harvest weight let's see how much I got now that I get a pound or more let's see with three planets of the Sour Diesel I got 110 grams with the green crack two plants I got 45 grams now that's not good alright so we got the OG Kush with three plants I harvested 53 grams now what's going on it's the nutrients I used I swear so it's candy cane with two plants 67 grams and there you go with the Giga bud with one plant I grew 26 now with the nutrients lineup that I use it was just cal-mag and pH my water and that was pretty much it with liquid karma I didn't given any but enhancements so maybe that's where I went wrong and and maybe not the foliated this whole girl so anyways this is the harvest I hope everybody likes there's more to come I'm gonna post more videos and another harvest video to come", "Nit5h16UYyM": "[Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that one if they

sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know

else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "KVFRkBbZ9-E": "everybody how you doing I stopped at the healing center today and picked up some grass roots they got a big drop across roots today and I'm rehydrating a bunch of it

that with the prices the way they are and I know a lot of people going to the street I'm telling you don't get painted okay be careful I would still recommend going to the dispensary if you want to get results like this on a regular basis the camera here move it around I'll get you focus on there [Music] look at that so let's find out what our yield is showing it's a support let's get you over here get this free centered up right there okay that would be let's find out what our yield is it seems like if I my superiors thought I had put them right here on the table but you know every good so can you see the hello let's get it in here a little bit easier for me to see no I want everybody see what we got here to get this [Music] all right down here", "UIoWegtrX_k": "hey we got the ring of reefer back up here with the seven items left last time it was a hex oh one this time I hope it's something different because we'll give it a quick shuffle here and give it a spin two of these are just a 1g1 dresser 3.5 so hopefully you give me a 3.5 points I was hoping throw an office hour that's what this is supposed to be it's innocent limelight supposedly a good office hours all right here it is Edison limelight I finally get to try Edison limelight see right here ultra sour I was hoping that would be an ultra sour and it picked one for me 20.1% I know ya 20.1% and package date April the fourth so not bad think yeah not bad anyway this is this is an Edison one [Laughter] so this Edison stuff here it goes for on OCS where I got it goes for 42 14 for 3.5 but if you get it from the SQ DC in Quebec it's 34 70 so much better price over there and I'm not sure where else it is it may be somewhere else if so I'll put the price up elsewhere because I think I'm going to start also listing other places just to show a couple other places maybe so we're gonna check the calibration here on the scale oh my god don't drop that on there oh my god that probably fucked it up shit let's check it oh fuck I have to reset it now there's the first time I've had to do this okay let's see I'm resetting the calibration it's a pass it said it was a pass so now we'll check it fucking drop that right on there oh I'm so glad it didn't damage it excellent so there we go okay here we go oh just sour hey this is a neat tone it looks nice mmm it has a nice ultrasound will to it hmm it's like a it's like ultra sour from a barn but hey but it's got the ultrasound we smell I can smell it I'm excited let's see what we got come on innocent oh and it's got a little one of these little guys in there too so moist you moist [Music] that's really nice Addison check that at 3.5 3 Edison this is very nice thank you Edison there we go got the buds all laid out all nice there some that's a nice buds in there and they're not too dry they kind of kind of have a little bit of a sponginess to them very nice and there's a very light smell which is a nice smell and it's a bit of an ultrasound smell what would a hint of a barn in there maybe so just looking at it from with your eyes you can see some see some trichomes on the inside there and stuff have to check in it with microscope of course all right we're checking out the outside of the Edison limelight it's an ultra sour yeah so the outside is kind of you know it looks if I think it just looks kind of you know real ambarish sort of with a hint of green to it you know the trichomes and whatnot but they're like you know a lot of them are sort of melted down not much really to see that's exciting looking well maybe I can do a close-up on this zoom in a bit yeah I'm hoping to replace my my favorite current favorite ultra sour so I don't have to give those to Maisie and bandits any more money because those guys just keep ripping me off it was anime Stian thieves whose bit of a zoom in here on the outside we got a bunch of stuff there's some more of it it's like I'm really cloudy with egg sort of like a you know cloudy kind of I don't know what color that is what the fuck color is that it looks kind of like a grape with some like I don't know it's a weird color it's not yellow it's like yellow with some green in it anyways I'm gonna break one of these buds open here and take a look inside cuz might be more exciting let's break off this little section right over here how about that that looks cool I can see all kinds of little sparkly crystally looks inside there oh yeah oh yeah look at that that looks much better inside a lot more shiny sparkly trichomes in here look right here though this is a nice little collection of all sorts of them more fingers zoom in on their shiny the super ultra mega close-up oh yeah we got one [Music] looks really nice look at that I like the way that they have different different bits of them have different sort of little little bits of yellow in them and stuff little droplets yeah I'm cool well stop those guys they're kind of melting together I don't think if that happens when they get old or if that happens when they dry it however they dry it I wonder what does that I still don't know it's a mystery I still haven't figured they anyways it looks cool check the other side here oh also really cool looking Gore's man this part here look at this this looks so awesome right here Oh looks like such an awesome picture you zoom in a bit more here cool that's cool I like this one though you get more of them in there where was it had the perfect angle damn I lost it but very nice very nice looks good anyways hopefully this stuff is better than that other stuff so I don't have to I don't have to buy any more of that stuff and get ripped off every single time cuz these guys gave me more than I was looking for which is pretty nice you see that nummies that's how you do it anyways I'm gonna try this ahead I'll be back so just got in from this Edison limelight here the ultra sour at 20.1% and this stuff here is it's pretty decent I would say a roof it's as good as the anime stuff maybe just maybe just slightly less for taste and smell maybe just slightly less but there is a nice ultra sour taste here too it's got that gassy kind of sour like citrusy taste kind of the the ultra sour taste you know ultra sour taste it's got that the high is kind of a nice it's a nice high I guess it's not insane or anything like that but it's decent that's for the buds they're nice buds they're the dryness on them is nice like they're not overly dry and the weight was uh right over the limit there was that 3.53 I think so pretty good the price is just a little much I like what it was at 41 or whatever the Quebec price is much better so I don't know are we nice to see them even but I don't know I like this stuff I like it I don't know I don't know if I like it as much as than amazed stuff but I like it almost as much I at least like it almost as much I might buy it again though although I will probably buy this in Quebec because it's like six bucks cheaper there it's exact same thing so why not right anyways that's some of this edison mine light decent if you feel like subscribing there give the button to click and there's a bell there and if you click on the belt will tell you the next time a video comes up and it should be one of the next ones on the ring of reefer there so I guess we'll see later have a go [Music]", "Um9CTQLQv3o": "was good job welcome to another episode of taste on you dude Alvin and today we've got ultra sour camp og less people profile ultrasound oh gee man it is a cross between MKULTRA and sour D cross with catarah toes - TK 91 minutes EK 91 is triangle cush my Kim 91 I believe I'm pretty sure that's what it is for me is a well a really well balanced strand we're saying strand now apparently but I think I believe that is the correct terminology y'all could debate in the comp it's up to you guys but a pretty good argument going on an Instagram but I think anyway back to it it's a well balanced trend I really feel that you get that body high behind the eyes feeling of an indica but at the same time you get that really heady racy feeling of a sativa dominant strain let's get into the census for the census first thing that we always do is we take a smell man so here is my jar and yes very and lemon lime e gas shiny lots of trichomes over there we need to break up the bud really let the smell out I'm gonna do that right here mmm a lot of funk in there lemon-lime gas comes out yeah I love this smell yeah strong very strong very pronounced lemon-lime the limonene is really coming off strong but you really really nice layer of funk and gas once you crack those buds open I mean it's just really strong it's a nice mix of your citrus flavors as well as your gas yeah so there's been cure for a little bit it's been curing for about two and a half weeks now and yeah I mean it's a little dry again like I said by humidity was just a little bit low while I was drying it however the terpenes are still there the trichomes are still there and from what I experienced the high is also still there oh man so you saw it you smelled it now I got to taste it that lime is really pronounced man it really comes out back in you get that lemon that gas you get on that aftertaste I really like this flavor combination it's one of my favorites anything citrusy and gassy I really like this is just my particular flavor it's like a strong 7up or a strong sprite but I do like the flavor however let's get high [Music] y'all know to 510 rule it's time to get high first five minutes I'm gonna be chief and come back in on a Malaysian on my mind and my body feel continue to cheat for another five minutes come back at the 10-minute mark let you all know mine in my body feel last time man previously I had the bright idea to go ahead and try to taste the weed and different methods right and you know rushing it until rising and doing all that that was great except when I was smoking it through a bong didn't matter find it through a bomb or through a joint whenever you burnt the weed it smells and tastes like bar weed yes you can get a little bit of the flavor but you get mainly smoked in aren't we burnt plant matter whereas if I use my desktop bait it's just really heating it and I'm getting more complex you know description huh and experience when it comes to the terpenes and the camp hunt the cannabinoids excuse me but so yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and do that I am still gonna squish the the trees that I'm tasting and then I'm gonna go ahead and review that as well but as far as the smoking from the bong they're probably not gonna be doing that anymore again just because of the inaccuracies from burning verses I mean the accurate palate that I can get when I do my desktop a man so I'm much really my preference moving forward but anyways man let's get high so we are at the five-minute mark and I gotta say it was very definitely a sativa leader I've been chatting to myself for like the last 10 minutes it feels like which I am because I'm staring at this [ __ ] phone but uh yeah it's a definitely people leader and it's really good again from a flavor standpoint gives you a fresh crisp lemon-lime flavor with that gas undertone and it doesn't drag you down it really is a peppy very heady sativa leaning hide the five minute mark again sometimes crosses could get really flip later on down the line so we'll see how I am at the 10 minute mark man let me go ahead and keep G from the highlighter I [Music] meant at the 10-minute mark he mad [ __ ] talkative is this like my fifth take of this particular spot and yeah man ten minutes definitely even leaning towards the sativa side still but I can definitely feel a little bit of anything start to set in so let's go ahead and wrap this thing up ultra sour chem og man it is a cross between MKULTRA by Sauer D crossed with TK 91 bred by the man the myth the legend mr. Kenner Otto for me it is definitely a sativa leaner but I did chop it at 60 and I do believe it can go a little longer so if you want more of a indica dominant flower I definitely will take a little bit longer and yeah I'm not going to be sworn in just because even everybody's different so my interpretation and my preferences are gonna be different yours but for me it is a great sativa dominant strain a sativa leaner if you want to call it strand sativa dominant strand we're doing that so yeah I really do appreciate it I really do like it and I think it's definitely one I put my top 25 top 25 strains of all time for sure yeah great job great job I meant let's go ahead and wrap this thing on it for real now I first and foremost man I want to thank the homies that made this possible rocks appreciate you letting me use your graphics for all your hard work man ray Feb Reb Fredo chase one to a fresh chuckle man at Rock Mart and I definitely appreciate you letting me use your music man if you guys want to shoot me some new stuff man it's always appreciate it and also any other artists any other producers man I just want to help me out and wanna throw some more music on man from the student at DM I'll shoot me an email I'd love to work with you network and help you promote whatever you've got going on as well but again tell my brothers man I really appreciate all the work that you put in and the work that you allow me to do man you really make this possible humming anything beats paint graphics you need full tracks or anything like that man and get at me and I'll put you in touch with the right people so the focus of the taste is definitely to be more community oriented I know a lot of us are making seeds a lot of us don't have access to these strains or these strands that we want in the dispensaries and so sometimes you have to purchase it and you have to grow it on your own and so a lot of the times a lot of people that I'll follow it these home growers meant making they grow on fire and these seed makers or readers that are lesser-known that aren't getting into the dispensaries may I have some fire ash crosses so I want to be more community oriented and see with these these home home growers and these home breeders these home seed makers are making what kind of fire crosses are they putting together you know and that you're not gonna find into dispensary but that's what I'm trying to tap into so if you're making these kind of seeds or if you're a breeder and you need somebody to test it out man definitely got space for your you know for your [ __ ] here my [ __ ] I mean straight up just trying to work together and help the community out and you know I I'm making some beans too so I'd love to trade at some point and then of course make them available to the public please let me know if you want to work together if you got products you want me to review if you've got anything flowers if you've got a seed you want me to grow all again all these taste episodes that I'm gonna do it's gonna be like a tribute to the underground man it's gonna be for the Lords of the underground the Hometown Heroes the backyard breeders you know to go home growers you know those dudes making scenes in the community the ones that that ain't gonna get the light that corporate cannabis is gonna gobble up man that's what I'm trying to help up that's why I want to highlight that's what the focus is gonna be on moving forward I mean every now and then you may just me all may come across a hit or at a dispensary and find that you know hope that golden egg that you've been looking for and and we come across it miss Apple and I'm gonna test it social media I don't need to list it out just look for the floating seed all one word it's gonna be almost every social media outlet there is definitely the main ones that's already given but some of the smaller ones I'm out there too you just gotta start dating but again the main area you can find everything is going to be the floating seed calm appreciate your time in our nation", "s4aLq7-QIUw": "everybody you can see of course got the [ __ ] you bierbauer son trying to get this thing to

today alright let's do some jet fuel uneaten battery sour banana bye oh Jesus let's go let's get that let's get that jet fuel then I have jet fuel effects on jet fuel in the car I don't all right let's get Sour Diesel I could swear I had jet fuel to card I'm trippin I'm trippin sour Dee sour Dee sour Dateline neighs Hoka no cush it's ghosts our D sour D we'll go Saturday all right so this is uh these are using 55 bucks okay so shout to Liberty I'm gonna pop this battery real quick if you guys don't know about Liberty batteries it's kind of like every other battery they're good they work for me they're eight bucks 10 bucks everybody else you still can't ten bucks you can't beat it okay so we're gonna plug this in right here get this charge and while we're talking get discharging while we're talking all right so this is from GTI there's Sour Diesel okay they have this doesn't energize you see that energized and the reason why is the terpene profile I'm gonna read these chirps off to you from the top to the bond how they are they and how they has enlisted the beta car point 1 beta merge point 5 beta pine alpha PI and combined point forward limonene limonene what everyone say Point 903 best point six point six ten point one so I'm gonna add him up quick math five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four and nine is thirty three so three point three percent in the terms that's insane that's pretty probably three point five you know boys don't quick math THC point just kidding seventy nine point eight all right it's co2 run so I get this silicon I like process its distillation process right run take the material you run it and then you get this on the other side so they you know co2 might not be a distillation process but see the two it's basically all the same kind of like you're basically taking this running washing co2 over top of the material right so you got your plant material which one everyone's get a butt out can get a bun out we got your whatever we got your plant material okay so you get your bud so I see all right so you get your flower all right and what happens is let's say there's just like whatever your flowers just sitting in something do we just put it right here okay then you introduce co2 Shh co2 washes over it and then what comes out in the other end is like a like just a bunch of crap gelatinous then you got it you got to filtrate this out you filter it out right you all then you get that manbearpig all right soured be saller d so this is my wake-and-bake official official we can be oh so you're going to notice the darker color and the reason is because of the extraction process so co2 basically sets it in runs it through there you go this lit you actually can go pink pink pink pink pink pink pink I think you can dose co2 I'm not sure though I know for sure desk so what they do is they remove the THC and the turps and then they infuse them back together the end this just washes over the material and then comes out like this I'm pretty sure don't quote me on that because I haven't done it yet actually was gonna go do that as a job but um you know I guess they just didn't like my number I'm looking for 62 thousand dollars a year salary I guess anybody wants to get that total dad so so here we go alright now you're gonna notice some like bubbles and stuff in here my theory is this okay you sure you something my theory is this you see is bubbling here alright so when they fill this right so when they fill it it was empty and they fill it what happens is there's air inside here okay and since there's no release for the air to come in when it comes in its gonna come out these bubbles and shoot to the top and that's how you get ad space that's just my in my head that makes absolutely the most sense alright so check us out you know the deal we're gonna we're gonna give this a warm up the screws on I just go to its don't stops okay you guys know the deal turn this on we're gonna cycle it let it warm up I hear the sizzle the sizzle is popping we got the sizzles so y'all hit me up on my G if

good for what it is the effects I'm feeling right now you can test me if you want you can say what you want but I'm telling you right now ready Terps the answer is Terps terpenes along with THC all right are gonna definitely give you the effects that you're looking for you know it's funny I have a lot of people that hit me up and be like with the talking about the like The Sands thta's if you will and I have a lot of people hate me up and say man you really like that stuff and I do I person I think it's I find it intriguing right I am intrigued by this why I question why why do I like that THC a so much and most don't and then I thought about it and I pondered and I thought and I thought and I pondered same word thought and ponder so I thought about it I was like man why is that hmm I realize some turps man most people don't realize it but they really love Terps alright so since I'm plus anymore right my lungs are taking in blinkers on the red and hurts it so cheers we're going through the water filtration hard hard in the lungs um I think it's too right somebody I mean we don't you smell you smell just she's not smoke you won't come say hi huh just see me you won't even move I'm pretty Linda again um man them red ones they get me we just asked everybody something why do people get so mad when at stuff you figure this out why do you do that here such a cat huh you think this is a water ball first make sure the guy is good right maybe wants to season it so I don't I don't understand right like let me just give you a hypothetical so I figure how to explain this I'm super late anyway it's a good car but this is making me think about something so this this type of this type of stuff I like I like one canvas makes me think see here and ponder like one wonder why I mean I kind of have wasted some time but I don't know if it's wasting time if it's so much I'm trying to learn teach myself something I'm always trying to better myself right try to maybe become more like I don't know Zen like if you will try to become closer and basically not try to let other people's actions influence my actions right respond to what let's just say this let me just say hypothetically we'll just you know two friends are hanging out okay friend a friend a and friend B we'll just do that so friend a right has some it's alright it's alright flower but it makes a great rosin right just like most of stuff in the programs do hmm and then let's say friend B is like all right you know friend a is like a cannabis dude that's it friend B's uh man yeah whatever dude right just say that he's mostly cannabis dude but he's also other stuff dude - definitely drinking dude all the time my fact every time I see him maybe maybe person be in person Eddie right huh every time person a sees person B no I'm just kidding but like all jokes aside let's just say you got to [ __ ] people you know right one [ __ ] guy goes to the other guy's house one guy you know like they're both they both like weed like whatever mean you were hanging out we like weed all right I give you some [ __ ] weed we check out the weed man this is [ __ ] probably go to the same [ __ ] all right whatever man hmm well you know and then let's say you know friend a takes takes takes this takes this plant squashes it and turns it into ol friend B's like I whatever next thing you know it's a there's [ __ ] two people one guy I mean like here's thing well you friend haze all happy yeah everything's cool great time friend be all Sun don't look so good what's wrong with friend B and B over there just turns over Angela starts puking his guts out you look a friend being friend a looks a friend being goes yeah did you take any [ __ ] drugs dude and then now French CDE like whatever all the rest of the friends around like whoa whoa yo hey what's up bro yeah you don't know you can't that's y'all you can't ask that question meanwhile I'm looking at friend B everybody out cdefg are all like you know I might not only ones remember I'm just pretend to be friend a in this hypothetical [ __ ] story here goofballs my only one seriously gonna sit here and be like really that's from lead I [ __ ] smoke weed like a [ __ ] that [ __ ] don't never happen to me not never ever friend ain't right I'm being I'm playing role-playing friend a here this abcdefg story anyway so then so then all sudden everybody cdefg you're like freaking out a meanwhile be is like so a says shut the [ __ ] up shut the shut the [ __ ] up a ob you all right yo B I need you to talk yo did you [ __ ] take some [ __ ] drugs B yo B yo yo you cool yo hey yo yo B yo right huh cuz we all known if that's not cannabis and that's the thing why the [ __ ] in this situation ice now you guys got the story are you like I could we dig it why is it that it was it that the person friend a a in this story we'll just say me in this story I was just playing it why is it that the person who's trying to figure out what's going on and do we need to seek some [ __ ] serious attention here other than you're just tripping out right I'm just trying to figure that out if I'm being a in this hypothetical [ __ ] situations anyway what I understand people may like it's just I don't I don't and I know cuz like ready I'm always gonna be the [ __ ] a so whoever's always in this hypothetical situation whoever is always trying to figure out what's going on and actually help but when they ask the hard questions right like let's just say if B is a person who's been known to be in recovery and relapse a [ __ ] ton of times and there's always relapsing constantly and then you know let's just say that maybe friend C's B's significant other and frenzy is said like oh yeah you know me and we've been doing XYZ on the low no because asking for help reaching out so aids in a weird position right a is always in a weird [ __ ] position so if I had to give a advice I would just have tell a just state of course I keep doing what you're doing you know hopefully you can and those that you you know don't don't don't let one don't let one person's situation take up all of your time for me being able to help out numerous people's situations you did go I'm saying like I don't know I'm done with this story but anyway I'm only one dude not only help out some of my peoples I'm [ __ ] waste of my time and I say wasting my time because that's sometimes at some point it becomes a waste of my time when I'm trying to help and yeah I feel like you are just utilizing or using there's not blind I pathetical story of just saying in general that's where I'm at in life so alright hope you guys have a great Sunday Funday be beautiful go out there shine bright alright happy Pride Month it's like it's a lotta there's a lot of [ __ ] to happens and I'm not so googoo [ __ ] really well I gotta have a month to [ __ ] you know just love all Earthlings because I say Earthlings [ __ ] have you ever pay attention to anything I say no cuz nobody listens to me I tell my wife rods I nobody listens to me that's okay so at the end of the day I just would say this look at what Sour Diesel does right look at what it does it just made my brain go on a [ __ ] wild tangent on why the [ __ ] why in abcdefg hang out why why why God let that be I like using that there's so many different scenarios you can apply that to right okay just take that one thing and basically it's cuz one person is talking [ __ ] I'm just gonna just break it real down for you one person's talking [ __ ] okay I just can't I can't read that at the same time so option what I'm saying is yeah listen don't talk [ __ ] number one I know you're [ __ ] limits and don't lie like that's why I'm you I don't talk so don't [ __ ] lie yo ready ain't no [ __ ] way ain't no [ __ ] way even after right after somebody throws up cuz I've been I've been sick from edibles and [ __ ] like come on no shit's how you figure out your dose oh that's too much dial it back next time right like it but you feel good after just gonna say you don't look good after maybe that's not freaking the [ __ ] yeah alright whatever but y'all be cool stay oh I gotta take pictures of this be cool everybody just be cool right and keep on pushing don't stop and yes this is good stuff alright and if you do need advice you have a card just like abcdefg right so if everything's all everything cuz keep in mind you know I have extra I have extra baby sitters like most people just have the cops I have the cops and then another cop on top of a cop who's always on my ass not not so much like that but just I have to follow every single [ __ ] rule to the tea every well every rule it's almost gonna say like it a great smiie if you can't tell by immediately how I just yeah but so don't don't come at me with some nice [ __ ] please stop doing that everybody all right we go I'll sell [ __ ] I don't [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't do [ __ ] I do my [ __ ] I [ __ ] put out this [ __ ] but listen all that extra [ __ ] stop that turn that down all right", "HuWqRwdxSTw": "dude - what is up guys happy Thanksgiving Eve I hope everybody's safe and gets an uber don't drink and

for a while and now I find a nice place in noodle on Staten Island thank [ __ ] two-bedroom loft see love addict huge kitchen garage yeah right cuz I hadn't grown in Elton villa on the island like a rock so I had to move I know I've been going back and forth Massachusetts for a while hanging out my friend that and so like now I got a connection upstate New York I meet these people on tour and at the following year what happened looks ok so I went also in this time I went over the Amsterdam these guys all went to Woodstock [ __ ] up there this is before that so I went over the Amsterdam time to go anybody's over there looking at all those idiots I came back with Northern Lights the Jack Herer the Oasis ok Northern Lights 5 and Big Bud but the one I prime L in Hawaii and the one that I used I took the cam and I took this desuka scum ok and I started breeding with these seeds that I got males Adam and I would beg up pile in little plastic bags each smell you know get rid of it and now I had Hawaii to use ok and I had given it to my friend FB just say that and he was still in it and I had the Northern Lights is what I believe I had a Northern Lights super scum crossed into himself twice and pollen II might accidentally with some wine I've got a half a pound of it we that had seeds in it what the [ __ ] this so I sold most of it to the guys and the Upstate crew they come back to me and one of them happens to be like this guy Joe that is in the article with with Adam where he meets him over in Amsterdam Greg Enix Greg over in Amsterdam and he was living up there I had a really calling and I sold him he grew some and I grew some of the seeds and believe it or not these were pretty stable for him but his cuttin was a little bit better than mine so the Sour Diesel what I know of has no no dog it's the super strong to Northern Lights and a little bit of Hawaii [Music]", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "cJCv_MVqJzc": "good morning good afternoon everybody and possibly could even depending on where you're at this is you grow I grow and I'm here on day 71 week 10 of the AJ's Sour Diesel and like I said before this is about my third run with her and this is going to be the longest I've ever taken her and I kind of just wanted to show you this what's kind of going on with her I did notice that on this on this run in reducing the nutrients down to about 80% possibly even a little bit less she's don't lot better stuff like this for example on the last run that I did she had a ton more of these kind of I don't know they're kind of like these little tiny leaves in here that a lot of people say or do to you know heavy nitrogen instead of that nature and this run she didn't as much but what I also notice is that she did not have as much frost as the last time but we'll see you know because not always having a super frosty plant means that it's the best right now I would definitely say between last run and this run less frosty this run way better smell super gassy and yeah she's doing really good and I'm going to probably post another video journal a week 11 so you can kind of get an idea and then obviously on week 12 when I cut her but she's doing very very well in soil it's just been getting really really fat as you can see and she's feeding out really nicely and unfortunately I got a little bit of bleach because she got too close to the top but other than that she's doing great and here's a full view get an idea right in here I got rid of some of the sub branches because I wanted to taste them and test them out so far they've been coming out perfect so I'll catch you guys soon here and here's the finished of week ten day 71 of the G Sour Diesel take care everybody and happy girl", "xGqxzUdumH4": "you - what is up push you here my home what birds here I'll check his temperature before he came he's good to go but we have the grass roots no G leaf we've got triangle push butter but we got these cherry diesel diamonds man which kind excited and got the charger running on on the never dead brain thing okay we have roan trotty's first cherry diesel diamonds here from G leaf nice chunky chunks ders what up gorilla grower well my dude yeah they're looking good mix them with some of this here that's the first just regular I can't see what you guys are saying I'm sorry how the cameras give me a second after I hit this couple sound of woman spin this a camera around summer darker than other color chunk and clear chunk get the double pump well you got smoking on today where you guys up to today usually diamonds don't have a taste and it kind of like drives me nuts like I really I love the diamonds because of the THC but usually there's not it has that like you know mean that different taste it's like smoking air kinda like like they personally taste I just think that said you know purified down little dark triangle course the allure triangle courses it smells really good man wasn't really good this is the kosher Tangier it's rural gummy like real soft I snow already from like it just hitting the hot ball so let's go to the diamonds are still Diamond juice left in there with the triangle it was Sunday somebody yeah too damn long too little you know pieces and it's pretty good all right look at that one chunk man that chunk is nice is that butter these blades quartz then I got sauce and shatter and some sugar where you got from your enough Illinois's right

[ __ ] stuck", "2I59758izvc": "good morning everybody I don't even know what day this is but I'll put it on the description and title of this video we are very close on pretty much all counts pretty good I must say so this is the critical plus and getting ready to harvest that fairly quickly now I believe I still don't see many amber trichomes which Jeepers Creepers no I'm just going to keep waiting till I get at least 30% average right bones and the Amherst Sour Diesel is looking fantastic there's a couple different fee knows I guess because this one plant has virtually no red hairs yet and this one has I'm gonna see some branches 50% on some branches about 25% wow it's a big difference this one which I have determined I believe is black dog actually because there's no way it's an anomaly if I have heard Sour Diesel it's just so not but frosty all over the place and absolutely stinky it's me it smells like a cushion perhaps some of you who want to sample this what they will have an opinion it's absolutely just the dankest I've never grown anything like it and the leaf structure everything is so different than the antler Sour Diesel so there you go I've been kind of fee a little bit of what you call epsom salts which apparently supposed to get rid of the red red stems it seems to have done that decreased it anyway and a little bit of molasses as well for carbohydrates and also would be electrolytes in the soil and so yeah I will probably be a week I'm thinking I may not get a chance to harvest this until next week I didn't think would be that long but yeah we'll stay tuned so there you are everyone I hope everyone has a pleasant Sunday", "5sfu9UO9ZSc": "what - what is up guys we got the Tahoe GTH CA sand and I would say for you to take it off - chill out

only a half gram I mean not stable they hook us up this is a fat half gram that's why I grabbed it again I thought I didn't know it was a different flavor because I had the regular THC ace and so I wasn't sure if it was I thought it was the same the go GOG but I had they handed it to me and it was different I was like aha heck yeah all right it's gonna see the meltdown I guess we'll show it to

named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "m-uORJCgzkA": "so I got something else here from the Quebec trip this is an amazed ultra sour 16.9% THC per gram or a hundred and sixty nine milligrams and they do carry an amazed on OCS but not this one the ultra sour tines miss ultra sour ever since the old weed md days haven't had that in forever i don't even remember if they made

the smell you just got to work work at it for a second and then it'll hit you in the face you're like oh sin Apple oh come on it's point one under for fuck's sake it was nice that I was point four was a point five I think wasn't even point five over on that original stash which is pretty nuts but I'm point one under here with Anna maced ultra sour so that sucks it's got a little bit of a sponginess to it you see I give it a little squeeze it has sponges back out so it's not ultra mega super dry it's just dry but with some sponginess to it let's see as for buds we got mostly alright buds here little tiny ones for the most part oh wait this is not a nice one what is this it's a piece of shit that's what this is oh my goodness look at that check a little here a pull or not a post but the outside it looks like it's covered in fucking centipedes ups a downs in abuse but any no it looks nice there's all kinds of trichomes on the outside right actually kind of a little sad that that's say something that's worthy of taking note of their nice good stuff looks like this stuff all around the outside on this ultra sour it's the maced ultra sour there's a whole bunch of those like melted ones I don't know what you call those ones that they look like they're all melted together or something I like smushed down they look like melted lollipops they'll stem the stem [Music] yeah you can see quite a few trichomes on the outside here though so that's really nice really good or well no if it's really good but it's it's a thing that's not bad if it's bad when they're not on the outside I guess it doesn't necessarily mean it's good that they are but it's bad when you're not I think let me see if I can zoom in real close on these guys it's a pretty neat right here let's see I test my skills icon in the area we're in the right area here look at that oh we cry we're so close up whoops fuck I'm like all over the place here it's a mix of different ones here there's some amber just I'm starting to turn amber there's some clear ones there's some smush - unless there's some cloudy ones those guys so I'm gonna open up this but here I'll take a look inside let's see what was going on in here who knows so there's a look at the inside it's got all kinds of trichomes everywhere all a big mix of all different types is seems to be the case usually you're looking inside these things that looks all right hoping that it's someone as good as the weed mu1 that was pretty damn good what the hell happened to that gone I forgot to make some more I need some more nice close-ups here looks good looks decent let me try an extreme close-up on these guys whoa look at that whoa see look there's a nice there's a cluster of amber ones that's trying to get you oh it's so much better this kind of little bit damn it oh here we go damn it's just a range Oh me and they can't get it fuck oh wait this area looks cool check out deserves more whoa super close look at that one down the air that's awesome so this is the 'no maist ultra sour there's a cluster of that stuff that looks like it's all melted down together yeah oh here we go look look look how it's all melted look at that is that melted ones together say what that is it looks like it see how they all it is that it is that neat now because of ultra mega close-ups I know what that is cuz I saw all the different little stems poking into it like they all fell over and just join forces all right let me go try this I just go back inside from this ultra sour from the maced and this stuff here the taste on pretty damn awesome I actually kind of really like this it's only 16.9% so basically 17 percent I think it might be better if they could bump that up a bunch I noticed on the website it says 15 to 28 percent so this is in low end of that and even at the low end of that this is nice I like this as far as the flavor goes I don't know if anyone's familiar with the weed MD or color of the shower but as soon as I started vaping this I was in I immediately remembered what that's like and it's pretty good this is a lot like that or even the same as that and the flavor lasts for quite a while and then eventually it changes first it sort of goes to like a a ghost train haze kind of a bit and then it goes to like then it just starts trying tasting bad but its first it starts a kind of like oranges in like cantaloupes and stuff flowers maybe I don't know a really interesting taste it's like the ultra sour the other ultra sour but yeah this one's biting too maced for me this has kind of a happy sort of head buzz kind of like a nice nice one where you can maybe like focus on something maybe you need to be perfect for playing video games or something I don't know that's probably I'm going to do so yeah I might even you know what I might try it I think and get a seven of this I might try and get to seven and see what it's like sometime I'll definitely be checking the percent though you know hopefully I'll get it at a higher percent but yeah I like this I would definitely buy it again it's got it's not overly drawing but it's nice and dry it's smell the smell is kind of low it's not too intense but the flavor is real good and this looks pretty fresh so I don't know if that has anything to do with her or not but yeah I will definitely buy this again I'll definitely get it again soon yeah well I'll make sure you subscribe to get more videos there or whatever and you'll see the notifications maybe who knows with YouTube I guess but anyways yeah we'll see you later and have a good one [Music]", "uTT9AxiHzqc": "[Music] it's a beautiful day in this neighborhood a beautiful day for a neighbor would you be mine how's everybody doing today welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania today we got an old classic we're doing a little review of a strain that's been around for a while i would say first time i saw this strain personally come on the scene like in other states obviously it was probably around like [Music] between 03 and 05 um this the strain is like a [Music] it's a staple strain it's one of the strains that people always use to cross into other strains to make them better make them stronger make them taste better so that being said today what we have on the table is some moxie sour diesel oh yeah we got that sour d this stuff is a classic classic there's a reason why this strain's been around for as long as it has there's a reason why it hasn't been bred out of the cannabis industry and out of the system it's because it's a it's a good one it's a heavy hitter it's it's really just it's a good one so that being said let's get into it [Music] we have thc coming in at 0.14 thc a coming in at 82.9 percent cbga coming in at 1.88 and cbg coming in at 0.67 first percent for a total cannabinoid profile of 85.66 percent 85 not bad gonna be strong gonna be it's gonna be strong so let's take a look take a look so i'm not gonna throw the terps up just not gonna do it we're gonna throw them i'm gonna the terps are gonna be right right here i'm gonna put the terp right in the screen right now either before or after i say this because editing is always so damn hard but yes let's get into the lineage we have unknown crossed with possible chem 91 super skunk lineage uh cerebral effects focused energized uplifting pain relief and appetite stimulation she is a hybrid [Music] it's been around since the 90s so obviously i came into the game a little late i was around in the 90s doing things with cannabis but wasn't that heavily involved so that's news to me i was introduced to the strain in the early 2000s uh because it was made in the 90s the lineage is not it's not exact people didn't really keep track back then so we don't know exact lineages we just know that there's an unknown crossed with possible possibly chem 91 and then that was crossed with something out of the super skunk lineage and that was how sour sourdy got born and bred but yeah it's gonna be a good one i haven't had sour d in a hot minute it's not because i don't like sour diesel it's mostly because like in this market with as many strains as there are to try and as many new cross like strains that are crossed with other strains like papaya crossed with fire og like i'm gonna pick that over something like sour diesel which i've had a million times since 2000 something i've had sour d so we're gonna revisit an old classic let's get into the smell and the look [Music] okay so nice floral hints with a peppery earthy thing going on let's give it a little mix up just to get those terps moving i like to i like to give it a little a little swooshing like a little stir up just to to really get the terps to come out because i like i like a good nose i like to get a good smell it helps me actually helps me taste to smell something is almost 90 of what you're doing when you taste something taste and smell have are very connected uh i used to be in the restaurant industry for like out of high school i used to work at the olive garden i used to sell people wine they made us take classes and learn how to become experts on wine and the reason you see people [Music] sniffing a wine glass and giving it a stir is because in order to get a full flavor when you drink it you gotta you gotta get a you gotta get a nose on it otherwise what you smell and what you taste might differ so that's my best explanation so 50 bucks for the half gram smelling strong and gassy [Music] it's got slight hints of gas um let's see did my thing turn off so it's a little bit gassy and it is [Music] floral it's got a little bit of what i would say like a geranium almost or like a a lavender and it's got that earthy pepper to it so as always we're gonna load up the puff go peek pro we're gonna double dab we're gonna give it a full try [Music] we're gonna give it a full send here guys all right [Music] here we go [Music] oh man it's like an old friend just came over to the house that you haven't seen in a while [Music] i love smoking strains that i haven't smoked in a while i forgot i forgot how good that tastes [Music] it's got gassy pepper it's got a earthy gassy pepper to it and mixed in with a lot of like floral hints i get a i get a good amount of floral out of it and yeah just gas straight gas sour diesel i forgot about you how could i forget [Music] i wouldn't mind seeing something like a a super sour diesel come back onto the scene it's just like a super lemon haze cross with sour diesel it actually gives the sour diesel a little bit more of a lemony pepper used to be one of my favorites super sour diesel wasn't a very common strain in many places but some people like in the philadelphia new york new jersey area you could find it back in the day so super sour diesel it tastes almost exactly like the sour diesel does but just a little bit on the on the more uh citrusy fruity side less on the less on the floral uh you know floral flowery feel but very nice very nice i can already tell you i am feeling its effects pretty pretty fast um this stuff is a nice heavy hitter it uh it'll definitely get you where you need to go going for the peak pro dab get it going so what's everybody been up to what do you all been smoking on i've been seeing a lot of reviews of some new companies and waiting for their concentrates to drop i will definitely be doing some reviews of the new company's concentrates and you know i'm curious i hope they're fire we need more fire on the market ah [Music] i'm telling you this thing rips oh flavor is actually a little bit better through the peak i think i need to clean up my banger and my heat now probably should have gave it a wipe down beforehand but you know these videos and how long they are so all right let's get down to brass tacks um as far as price 50 bucks as far as the way it looks did i even show you guys this stuff is [Music] nice it's very nice very consistent with their other sugars [Music] you know moxie they're consistent the consistency of their products is like way far better than most um the sugar is always the sugar the batter is always a batter the diamonds are always diamonds and the sand is always sand and the consistency is always there so the flavor is outrageous i just hit these both i've been talking for a couple seconds i still taste it like it's there i'm probably gonna taste it until i drink something or eat something like it's it's the kind of flavor that like it it goes ahead and it holds on tight so as far as price average 50 a half fine deals i didn't i think i paid maybe 45 for this because i found a place that was having a sale you should too that's how it goes um but as far as strength i'm kind of rambling kind of lost my train of thought a little bit definitely top of the head decompression high like decompressed a little bit felt like a a little less pressure in the head and uh definitely heavy in the eyelids but i would say for a hybrid it's kind of a 50 50. so [Music] it's kind of not like super super down but it's kind of you know i'm not super up either so i don't know it's kind of a toss up so if you guys get a chance and you can't find anything that you haven't had in a while or can't find anything new i would pick this up it's still on the market for a good reason the reason being it's it's you know it's proven itself over the years as a strain that is worth keeping around and honestly like i said it's been crossed with many things many many other strains and it has made many other strains much much better so if you get a chance pick it up it's a plus it's a legend like og status this stuff is sour diesel it's one of the greatest of all times that's why it's still around but that being said um if you're not a subscriber hit that subscribe button um i appreciate it we're almost at 200 uh i'll probably do a giveaway at three that way i have time to gather up things for a giveaway and yeah other than that that thumbs up get at me in the comments let me know what you think let me know what you're smoking on let me know you know what you guys think of moxie sour diesel what you think of other companies sour diesel how do they stack up because i know everybody has a sour d like sour d is in most people's stable of strains like everybody has a sour diesel mother somewhere it's it's one of those strains like everybody loves it everybody smokes it so all right guys i will see you in the next one peace", "w_aFqep1208": "yo yo yo how's it going guys just a med man here and this is uh just some West Coast Sour Diesel that I grew up from seed because I'm always always testing new backcrosses and doing test runs and all the beans that I'm making so the male used in the male donor or this cross was a sour diesel kush also known as med man's headband and it's crossed to the elite clone my West Coast sour diesel cologne and this one this one turned out very much like the mother did it's there is no co2 in this room and there was actually some heat stroke in here for two weeks the intake actually stopped working so it got a little bit hot in here but for the most part this things are eager this is a real kerosene khush I'm guessing that there's going to be at least a pound and a quarter a pound and a half here I don't even know if you can decent you here with the lights and everything but just wanted to show you these huge chunks are just like it gives you gives it gives you a new understanding of what they sit with what they meant when they said train rack because all the branches are to break it off like just they're all hanging down just growing with my bloom boosters in advance three-part and look at how much this thing is flushed it's just totally yellow bugs are beautiful and crystally smells like kerosene and these things are just rock-hard you seriously cannot

or forty percent cocoa forty percent sunshine mix number four with a little bit of Rockville rock wool fiber girl in there about ten percent so yeah check out these chunks I'll probably take take some pictures and I'll actually maybe make a video once this thing is hung up on the on the hanger mad men style so yeah enjoy the new videos coming up I'll actually even just grab a regular kitchen chair here just to give you guys an idea some scale yeah she's the beef from head to toe and just reeks like sweet kerosene so yeah enjoy the butter from this thing is going to be on real hot with video for that too all right y'all talked you seem", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "oeMwsR-rkx0": "ol\u00e1 everybody welcome to day 29 of the Amherst Sour Diesel bro we do have a little bit of variation though in here I had ordered five Sour Diesel thinking I could fit five in and I have fit one two three four five in trouble is is this little one is a Sour Diesel and her sour diesel that just failed to to keep up with everyone else so I went and popped critical class seed that kena was a free seed that came with the order so it's the only indica now in the bunch now the other interesting thing is one of this 20 of these things is not like the other we have for Andrus our diesels that this is one of them this is another and this is yet another the fourth is this one see something different so I don't know what happened this one acted like it was choked for a while I brushed a piece of seed husk off the stock and suddenly it took off but it looks like more like this but it looks like a lush indica so obvious seem to see what that one puts out but it's supposed to be an adverse sour diesel so I have removed all the fan leaves from these three and I've topped them and I've actually tried to do what's called Femi which is [ __ ] I missed so when you take the top off you actually got a really good picture of it here but you actually kinda instead of having to shoot off you pinch the top usually get two shoots coming out in this case I might have three coming out here or four because I actually pinched about Oh two-thirds of the way down the bud instead of pitching the whole butt off and it gives you often what's called the [ __ ] I missed or film result if you're lucky so that's it day 29 for some her Sour Diesel d9 for the critical plus we will keep you up to date as best we can and I'm just not being as yeah as I should be doing more but anyway these are looking good the soil has all been amended properly so we've got some general a guy at general 444 we've got some won 13-6 we've got some glacier dust in here as well for more of things like calcium and minerals and we'll see how it goes they look absolutely beautiful I have not added any liquid fertilizer whatsoever nothing at all just watered

torch with the the automatic lighter on it igniter pretty good these work way better then them little tiny torches butane ones you buy it head chops they're like that big they suck and then you go out and like it leaked just to last you at least a couple weeks even for heavy dabbers maybe a month if you don't have much but I go to them about every couple of weeks cuz I be dabbing heavy so it was that all right go GOG one gram of the sugar [Music] cool funky funky look at the go GOG sugar as one DRAM as a nice hefty pile there looks like a gram to me get you another zoom in close-up look at that that is go GOG buy Moxie 90% cannabinoids a couple dabs of this and let you know what I think of the go GOG I did have this before so I you know that's so I know it's good is I had it before it

fast let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know if you've had the go GOG by Moxie before I like to burn off a lot of the old stuff get it red hot and burn off

it's pretty fresh live resident sugar not too big of a DAB a little dab you try it out small go small first Cheers go GOG buy moxie Wow got a nice very nice flavor it kind of reminds me a little bit of the Alpine og similar to that with a little bit more pining this to it it almost tastes like the lemon OG x Alpine OG it's kind of close to that kind of similar to that for me but this has a lot more like heightening flavor to that very good though go GOG very nice let me get another dab and use my other dab tool over here switch up to a cold tool we'll get it a nice that's a little bit fatter a little fatter bugger there on there look at that one we do that one now that's a pretty fat one decent size I'm so used to having a lighter I always go to reach for my lighter because I just got this like yesterday and I'm still new to me that I don't need a lighter anymore because mostly I use vape pens and now with this no lighter needed anymore kinda I always go for a reach for my lighter and I'm like wait something different do another job that you dived for you guys on this video I don't want to make it too long and it said it was a hybrid go gog giving you the basics one gram I paid $96 for the gram I did have five dollars off eight points so I paid ninety one dollars for some reason the grams are priced $96 really uneven number for some reason but it's how they do it at least eerie rise that's how they do it nice and hot set what timer I like sitting a timer because it gives me an exact I know that when I heat my when I heat my thing one over here a bowl up to red-hot that forty seconds gives me a perfect cooldown time you know trial and error so depends though if you get a cheat that's a cheap banger if you get a better quality banger probably might stay hotter longer but I bought this one for seven dollars a smoker friendly yeah Cheers let me know what you guys are smoking on smoking on the go GOG by moxie excellent that's got a really good flavor but really like pop and the flavor pops highly recommended if you haven't tried it try it go GOG by Moxie it's fire that when I'm really feeling it after doing that second dad it's coming on pretty

a little bit different from New York City diesel it's not quite as good a quality I don't believe and it's it's the the original not quite as sure of I've seen a few different strains called that but it's got a good up buzz and I really think it's important for people like to have Saturday so it's like looking for like ms nausea there's a class of patients out there they don't want to get floored higher they don't want to get reported and so Sardis was very important for those people to Tac ratios from New York City diesel to Saira diesel is like probably I'd say about 25 to 30 percent different but neat that the society so yields a lot better and it's a lot easier to grow so there is a trade-off there it's been hybridized for Saturday so can run anywhere from 70 days to 90 days it depends on how what's one of the ones it is there's several different versions of it how the average height of Sour Diesel is from 3 to let's see the biggest one I've seen some in about 7 foot saturday so yields from two to right eight ounces depending on how much indicated pros of Sour Diesel is easy to grow it can also be a very beneficial cannabinoid ratio to your body cons it's not just a bullish strain and you got to watch out for chicks with digs Sour Diesel is very similar to a whole bunch of generic sativa strains [Music] you", "VuVwtrRGRM8": "[Music] yeah they find out got some

percent in total CBD is 0.19 percent harvested at 11:21 of 2016 purple diesel done by couch lock productions like I said twenty eight bucks for an eighth limited edition let's go ahead will real quickly give you a close-up shot of this purple diesel here get it to autofocus a little bit nice light green bud to kind of a blondish color up in there got some nice amber orange hairs in there and of course we got some purple you can tell but broke off there so the huge the center up there is really light green almost white pretty good trichrome production kind of leafy though be nice if it was a little bit better manicured job but this was only twenty eight bucks and eight so can't complain pretty good manicure medica job for what it is show you guys another bud here and we'll be getting into the smoke look at the purple there there's some purple for y'all apologize about the shake and holy [ __ ] my hand will not stay steady so yeah we got some purple some white green amber orange two bright orange hairs on this one here like I said you can see that Center right there we got a little purple in the center on this one a very light green like I said a really good try chrome production really dense nug not too fresh not too dry but we're gonna get into the smell test the taste test and the heart test high test the high test of this purple diesel here so go ahead and get smoking along guys and so the small test of this purple diesel here gets a 5 out of 5 very strong lavender floral smell mixed in with a very strong Sour Diesel funk smell to it they blend in very well so you get that nice mix of a floral lavender that's kind of sweet but also very strong very pungent mixed in with that super pungent that district that's just that just makes you gives you that stank face that sour faces whoo that Sour Diesel pungent and with mixed in with a little bit of pine but the small test hopefully a 5 out of 5 likes it very strong very loud package as well as great smell greens taste us cheers y'all Green's taste-test gets a 5 out of 5 tastes just like it smells get that very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that very strong Sour Diesel funk with that little hint of aftertaste at the very end of pine it's not very strong very long-lasting on the palate still taste it right now it still feels like I'm still got smoking my my mouth right now as you can see I don't but definitely a 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test like I said great tasting with that sweet floral lavender taste mixed in with that Sour Diesel funk skunky counter taste to it it's a little hint of pine in the aftertaste now after green taste test on this purple diesel here gets a 4 out of 5 and the fifth and six hit you lose the aftertaste of that pine and overall you do lose a little bit of flavor and the overall taste itself but besides that even in that fifth and six it I still got a very very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that soured Diesel's you know skunky funk kind of taste to it and it's so has really good flavor like I said I do lose the aftertaste of that pine in the after greens taste test and like I said it does it's not as strong as it was in the first hit with the floral and the Sour Diesel skunked to it come up for the most part still has a great flavor and I definitely give it a 4 out of 5 for the after greens taste test after greens taste us and the high the high I definitely give it a 5 out of 5 I'd say after taking about seven hits here we still got nice fat Bowl in here I am well and [ __ ] stoned I got a nice relaxing somewhat couch walking indica hi body hi with that very energetic kind of heady Spacey sativa head high but very strong first couple hit you start feeling the effects immediately and it's a very well balanced fit 250 head - indica split high and like I said very strong hit you right away so you don't have to sit there and smoke up a bunch of your weed to get stoned so definitely a 5 out of 5 for the high and my official review here of this limited edition purple diesel that is done by couch lock productions I will have to give it a five out of five it smells great it looks [ __ ] awesome it's definitely you know it's something they look something cool to look out you know we got the [ __ ] the purple on there you got the light green no it's definitely a very interesting but look at when it smells great it tastes great but on the green stasis and after greens taste test it get your stone real quick and has a good well-balanced 50/50 hybrid split heart so my fissure review is definitely a 5 out of 5 definitely some great stuff I do like this I will be picking this up again for 28 bucks an 8 that's a great [ __ ] deal as well for some really good [ __ ] cannabis there don't be some top-shelf quality cannabis for only 28 bucks and eight that's it that's a one hell of a deal right there but I definitely recommend you guys to go to your medical or recreational wherever you get your cannabis at this sounds like a frame that might interest you definitely go check it out I enjoyed it it tastes great smells great and they get you stoned that's all you need with weed so if you like those flavors that I was telling you about those smell sells funny about the high I've been telling you about definitely go check this out like I said at your medical or

"nYoCyCch2t0": "[Music] extracted marijuana concentrates have become one of the most popular forms of ingesting cannabis at the clinic we primarily stock three forms of BHO or butane hash oil produced by our expert extraction team at the lab these include butter shatter and live resin batter let's take a closer look at these three forms of concentrated cannabis products butter is a form of BHO that has an opaque warm taffy light quality this concentrate is created by extracting the cannabinoids and terpenoids ride and cured it is an oleoresin which following extraction is agitated over low heat to allow the solvent to evaporate creating a wax like non transparent extract this agitation causes THC a which is solid at room temperature to precipitate from the rest of the oil and crystallize butter has a reasonably high terpene profile as it is processed using low temperatures to preserve these sensitive flavor compounds shatter is a clear glass light concentrate that contains no bubbles and snaps at room temperature it is difficult to make due to its low heat requirement and length of time required in a vacuum oven to purge it of its solvent in shatter the cannabinoids terpenes and waxes are all mixed together in one phase and in a way that allows light to pass through the molecular structure the terpene content is typically lower in shatter as heat and vacuum contribute to the evaporation of compounds however the visual appeal of the product tends to supersede its flavor life resin batter is a terpene rich concentrate created by freezing and extracting the whole cannabis flower immediately after harvest this process preserves all the cannabinoids and turpentine the plant because the cannabis has not been dried or cured prior to extraction fewer terpenes have a chance to evaporate or degrade as a result the end product has a much stronger flavor profile because live resin contains higher levels of these liquid terpenes the final extraction tends to be more viscous than butter or shatter if you're curious for more information on cannabis concentrates or which extraction might work well for your needs please talk to your friendly budtender at the clinic today", "akodC6YYXTM": "[Music] what's up everybody p2ps here and you know we're back with another car comp episode this time we're taking a look at the himalaya vanilla sherbet live resin cartridge and we're stacking that up against the you know classics raw garden this time triangle cake strength i'm kind of really impressed with the himalaya packaging i like the fact that the cart doesn't come in a tube i feel like that's a lot less waste and uh i think that's pretty cool that they donate their some of their proceeds to himalayan wildlife and all that stuff right there you know these cars in there are pretty cool stuff too really cool stuff i i've never bought himalaya before so i'm definitely gonna go uh check out another one soon so yeah you know here is the raw garden stuff very standard very standard and uh yeah now we're gonna jump into uh the homie taking a little taste of his first raw garden this triangle cake it tastes good the hair was a lot better than i expected i like this one it's pretty sweet mommy freddy says a bunch of more uh intelligent stuff but i didn't really tell him i was gonna use the audio so that's my bad brother now we got some hits out of the hamilton ps1 yeah that is a delicious combo you're right bro like the raw gardens heavy is balanced by that like lightness from the himalayas flavor that's hella nice yeah if you guys ever get a hamilton ps1 triangle cake and vanilla sherbet is the move man we geniuses for this thing [Music] and welcome back so uh this is once again guys cartoon comps episode three we did a quick uh impromptu like on the spot uh first thoughts on these cards but uh yeah i'm going to jump into my uh more well-developed kind of thoughts so we'll start off with the himalayan vanilla sherbert cart um so the first thing i could say off the bat with this thing is its flavor isn't as deep as the raw gardens it kind of just lightly coats your tongue kind of thing and uh it leaves like a really kind of like airy well not airy maybe kind of like a fluffy sort of like uh profile in there so let me take a hit real quick and give another quick rundown of the flavors so it's actually kind of nice that you do kind of get like this vanilla bean ish kind of flavor uh coming off of the very initial taste of the very initial hit of this in the first initial taste like that's that's very rare that like a strain kind of actually tastes exactly like how you think it's it's going to taste when you you know read the name um but yeah there's not too many terps compared to lily to uh well i wouldn't say two not as many terps but the tit doesn't taste as terpy compared to raw garden ones um yeah this this is very light very kind of smooth uh live resting cartridge and you know that that's kind of surprising for me it normally tastes like a deeper flavor and it's it's nice that this is a different experience so far compared to the other live resin cartridges i've tried of course chronic creek nug which i haven't done a review yet on and hush which is coming soon and you know obviously ragon so now that we've tried our vanilla sherbet himalaya we'll do another quick thoughts on our rogar and triangle cake so yeah you guys know ragaron always has like some good stuff and always has like a very familiar turkey taste about in your first kind of hit so uh we'll see what triangle cake got a little different for us cheers oh hmm yeah this so this has a little bit more of a doughy kind of uh flavor there of course triangle cake but there's also citrus tones to it too this is very very unique kind of taste uh i wouldn't say it's a citrus cookie that sounds really weird but it's it's really nice like a sweet sweet citrusy kind of doughy flavoring obviously the same turkey hits you get from rawgarn this one doesn't feel as deep though as the space box number two for example like the the first hit here is definitely more of the doughiness and then there comes that citrusy after but yeah pleasantly surprised with the himalaya brand uh live resin cartridges i mean it's a little more expensive than the rawgarden one so i was hoping it'd be a lot better and um yeah i think at this point in time at least compared to triangle cake i'm liking this vanilla sherbet a lot better obviously it doesn't really look like that it looks like i'm enjoying the triangle cake a little bit more but i definitely like this vanilla sherbet a lot and now we get to a newer section on our car clumps uh courtesy of this hamilton ps1 trying out the cartridges with water filters um a lot of people you know out there they're just consuming either oil pen stuff or cartridge stuff you know just by itself uh but this hamilton ps1 absolute game changer i'm a big fan of water filters and the smooth hits that they can provide and it also helps you give a lot more or get a lot more flavor out of it so right now we got the vanilla sugar in and we're gonna take another hit cheers oh there it is wow there's actually the deep turkey flavor that uh i was talking about earlier with raw gardens it's kind of there with the himalayan not as deep but there is that trippy flavor now it's kind of crazy how much the water filter changes up so uh now let's see what kind of difference it makes with our raw garden i'm just gonna switch the cuts right here right here's just the plug since i'm only hitting one at a time they recommend that you keep the plug-in uh just just only if you're doing like solo hits with a one cartridge i think it kind of preserves the uh the thread there the connector connector yeah so this is once again the triangle cake and uh yeah cheers boys oh hold on i think my rocker is a little clogged there oh it's not okay all right let me get a proper hit for you guys you know this one tastes a little bit the same as a hit without the water filter just it's much smoother obviously i got a way bigger hit there and um excuse me i guess another thing i could say is the pininess is a little bit more noticeable when you get to the water filter so there's i was gonna say that there was an aftertaste of uh pininess to uh the triangle cake but uh i wasn't sure if i was tripping or not but yeah this this confirms that there is that so that's pretty nice as always guys if you enjoyed the video please leave a like leave a comment drop a little sub too maybe you know you want to see a

is not a half a Rams I I can't stand but when that happens like they worded that the way you think you're getting a [ __ ] full gram or some [ __ ] and you get it in is not like I'm not paying [ __ ]

clicks cheers boys I'm gonna do alexxa fight closer to the Sun Cheers goddamn those good with [Music] I uh I am not getting that real good head but I guess because of the CBD it's more of like a kind of mellow I definitely feel like more looser and everything um so the effects are definitely there for the [ __ ] the pain in the muscles and and all that good stuff which if you guys know I'm in this program mainly for chronic pain so that's why I take it I don't have PTSD or anything like that you know I mean it's mainly pain for me if I've radiated this arthritis but carpal tunnel waters hit my

by hey smoking on one of my night table that's super flavor let me put it on spindle like we're gonna be looking at some CBD shatter so without further ado let's jump to the close up get to the review all right Burke that was get some little bird emojis clapping in the comment section as we get ready to review this CBD product right here they were looking at this CED shatter and it's this Sour Diesel this comes from [Music] it is 99.6% CBD zero THC so this right here will not get you heart but it's another way to the CBD and at ninety nine point six percent is pretty pure let's open this up until you see what this looks like all right bird club just right here it's our diesel shatter [Music] pretty solid form right there that's all CBD trichomes we're going to take the little piece of this off put it in this woken disposable little atomizer you get a nice little pure taste of it let's see what it tastes like I'm the CBB so if you know anything about CBD is very helpful to your aunt a bernoulli system um there's many blocks how you about it so if you don't know I suggest you read it up CBD is really good for you um and this is just a doubt the weight to the stump so everyone to break a little pieces off put it in the atomizer see what it tastes like now to get some of this now tell you the truth I've seen cocaine looks like this I don't believe it's not the same consistency or texture as THC oh Shannon like like that turns sticky again after a minute this isn't turning sticky screw statement I'm gonna just break a piece off they were pretty disruptive see with taste they break grace apart real easy vambrace for it real easy that's a decent sized piece of God right there so won't take for this Sour Diesel see me deep-sea um they got actually Sour Diesel taste too [Music] [Music] God is slinging real [ __ ] I got Josh no that was a little harsh [Music] [Music] that's not easy to do that's not you know there's a nice taste to it it doesn't doesn't have a lot of the terpenes or the marijuana taste to it it's very like um vegetable Ike him um yeah I don't know that there's enough Sour Diesel terpenes in here you do pick up a little bit of the taste on the aftertaste but not really funny inhale again it may just be the way down assuming it was just atomizer maybe it's heating up too hot can you do is try to smear someone this blood see if I can get get it the cold like that rate being so stable it's gonna be kind of hard to get it on here let's try it out so what I did was set it on its supply right here see sterling now they melt it utterly down in round black it's just smoke it's having a very uh MP flavor and set air and to smoke [Music] it's not it's not bad way to consume CPD's I'm sure we're using a regular dad break you can probably get better hit soft but um I want some if we use them to be clean break it down inside of my butt so the very next Rock will do what I'm gonna do please I'm gonna add some CBD flour some of the CBD shatter home some regular dance it's a rather explain minute put it together see how that smoke where the without um I will say this put a link in the description for um techne website out they got they got a couple of different uh strains in this um if you're into you the CBD again this is a different way to ingest it also if you're using their a this is another link do it to that to the Marley I'm out burka [Music] really by flowing away in the brain hole drugs I'm smoking", "y5pW3XIVfjc": "all right I got these brass knuckles cartridges brass knuckle cartridges this one's a girl ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your

everybody welcome back to the channel this is Pine Street 21 and over medical cannabis review channel you're already a subscriber you probably already knew that and if you're not a subscriber consider hitting that subscribe button I come out with new content quite often so how's everybody doing another day is going by another day of quarantine or whatever we want to call this spiel but yeah just kickin it making it happen supplying the food you know storage making it making it possible to get through this without having to come in contact with anybody or anything and there two weeks or however long it may be pretty interesting playing a lot of PlayStation and a lot of Call of Duty mobile on my cell phone doing a lot of yard work to get out of the house and feel the Sun on my face because lord knows we all need to get out of the house oh yeah it's cranking out these vids cranking out the reviews guys I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoy making them for you cuz it is also given me something else to do during this hard time so if you're looking for something to do and you're bored and you smoke cannabis why not review it why not jump on people are making cell phone videos left and right you might not get that 4k quality or you know what but at least you're doing something better than just sitting around watching watching TV and doing a whole lot of nothing so that I digress I digress so what do we got going on today something fun another concentrate got it keeps concentrates cranking as always from the good people over at moxie we have lemon og live resin sugar this stuff is really nice some really good medicine hold on a second here alright there we go got my got my monitor back we're having a little technical difficulties so Moxie lemon og live resin sugar as you know your boy loves the the lemon and the orange profiles so I had to pick this stuff also it's a which is one of my favorite types of concentrates I'm a huge fan of the live sugars and the live diamonds and sauce those are literally my two favorite of all time types of concentrates so straight out of the gate smells like fresh lemons it's like you just cut open a fresh lemon far let's see what kind of numbers were working with here we have THC at one point to 8% g8 CA at eighty four point one five percentage CVG a 1.88 percent and CBG at zero point seven three percent and that's all as far as cannabinoids go and it comes out to eighty eight point zero four percent which is some high test stuff it is it's gonna be real good as Moxie stuff always is I don't think I've ever given Moxie a bad review I'm not gonna lie it's not cuz they sponsor being here not because I work with them in any way but honestly it's just because their stuff is superior it is a superior product all the way all around so let's just get on into it okay as I said it was smelling like absolute ol mo as far as what it looks like it is a blond sugars always hard to get those close so it's always hard so as you know if you watch the channel I'll put a close-up in in the video I'll just drop a close-up in there so you guys can get a nice close-up as far as price fifty bucks for a half gram as always you know how Moxie does so let's get into it and try it out go ahead and pan around turn this email on bang bang you know what I love sugar guys I know like there's a lot of a lot of different types of concentrates out there on the market but sugar is one of my faves it's always it always delivers in flavor and potency you know how we do what we got we're up to three hundred give that a minute let's give that a minute and hope that my camera doesn't hear I can't tell if it's my camera or my cell phone that I use to control my camera but one of them is down to three percent so hopefully we can get through this video before whichever one oh how I'm just gonna die dies this is I would hate for that to happen like 450 so yeah 50 bucks for half gram sorry about that camera died like I said it was gonna had to go and grab a new battery as I was saying $50 half grams there you know they're expensive but you get the best quality product it is on the market and you cannot complain when it tastes good cannot get better medicine it's expensive because they know it's good I have friends in Colorado that say that they're getting this exact same stuff or a lot less I'm not gonna say how much less but a lot less if you're really curious go ahead jump on the internet it's not hard to find out but it is kind of insulting I forgot to plug my mic there we go that'll be better so like I was saying $50 half grams you get what you pay for it's the best medicine on the market or at least one of it's definitely top three in the flavor profiles they have with their concentrates and their pens and all that stuff it is absolutely the best let's go ahead and dab on this [Music] get this lemon og flavor [Music] davin on a fresh lemon very sweet Olo full of flavor just full of flavor the last one I did both sour lemon OG x tan G and that stuff was like 10 out of 10 all day long that stuff was awesome and it was probably like I would say top 5 flavor profiles for me because I love fruity and citrusy flavor profiles and this stuff is right right alongside it it is it's delicious yeah very good so tasty man Moxie is like magic they whip up magic in their labs eighty eight point zero four cannabinoids so cannot go wrong with that man I tell you if this is still in a store near you pick it up lemon og live sugar it's not that batter it's not the butter it's not a wax the sugar it is full of flavor full of herbs tell you right now super-strong medicine not too jittery or anything but I'm not I don't really get the jitters like many people do I don't I guess I can see where some things would give people the jitters because it's more high-end sativa and it gives you that pep in your step but I don't really get too much of that so I would call this a nice mellow buzz real strong but not so strong it's gonna put you to sleep or anything it's a nice hybrid pretty sure it's any pretty sure it's sativa leaning hybrid but they don't really really put that on their box if you want to see the Terps the Turpin profile is on Moxie's website they are like a page long there's probably like 30 or 40 different Terps that they put in their profiles that's why they don't put it on their boxes their boxes are super duper small and like they would have to have like one of those little fold up pamphlets but it would have to like would have to be like this long in order to get all of the Terps that they have in there on it so I think they just say screw that [ __ ] and if you're really that interested you can go on their website but it's as far as one through ten as far as everything like an overall one through ten this stuff gets a 9-5 you my boss the flavor it's like all right so it might just be unfair on mine cuz like so what I had before this which was sour lemon og times ten G's like I said that was like super amazing so anything after something that's super amazing it's not like right on par with what you just had it's probably not gonna get as high score because what you just had was awesome so it's kind of like it's kind of like being a musician and having to go on stage after Elvis like what do you mean oh yeah I don't want to follow Elvis that's like Ludacris nobody wants to follow Elvis Elvis is like the ender of the night you know nobody wants to do that so I might be being a little unfair it might actually be like a 975 or close to a ten cuz moxie stuff is so it's so tasty that's why you picked so much of it up I just you can't you can't go wrong with flavors I mean the price sucks I get it but if you're looking for really good top-shelf medicine and you want to spoil yourself every once in a while or there's a crazy epidemic going on in the world and all you can find in your local dispensary is $50 1/2 frames I mean you gotta get what you can get so if you have the money definitely pick up some Moxie lemon oh gee it is quite nice the effects are starting to roll in nice and heavy definitely gonna go and enjoy it I'd be taking my dog for a walk yes nobody's in the streets so we can just go for crazy walks and come in contact a zero or almost zero people so it's kind of nice it sucks because this [ __ ] sucks and I wish it wasn't happening but taking lots of walks with my dog so if you like the videos as always subscribe tell your friends hit the thumbs up hit the notification bill comment in the

"tjwxqTVPfzQ": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is trippy Tuesday episode 54 today I'm reviewing a company called brass monkey for the first time this is a local company here in San Diego and if you're here in San Diego or even nearby you've probably seen or heard of these guys they sell a lot of cheap concentrates generally like 30 $40 grand trim runs this is there live resin which is a little bit harder to find definitely a legitimate live resin I had a chance to meet with them and find out that this live resident the gorilla glue is grown in house so it's always nice to find out that a concentrate is a single source when the company is growing and extracting everything in-house it's usually a better end result less cut corners and yeah this gorilla glue is no exception from brass monkey it's really good this stuff recently I picked up the award at the local farmers market which is like a cannabis farmers market we have here in San Diego picked up awards for highest potency and People's Choice so yeah this one is definitely one to keep an eye out for the gorilla glue my present from brass monkey yeah I haven't really tried too much of their stuff I had this flavor and I had one called Buddha candy which is also really really good yeah but a breast monkey awesome love the branding and this guerrilla food life resin is a treat for sure the smell on it is not the I wouldn't say the loudest gorilla glue and I think of really living like a woody kind of like chocolatey funky yeah just just basically almost like wood like I've said before like sandalwood kinda like wood chips chocolate kind of Punk like diesel funk this one is definitely more like a it's almost got more like an indica funk to it like like a blimey kind of I wanna see like gasps but it's a little bit more earthy compared to other gorillas glues I've had which I think are a little bit lighter without rambling anymore guys I'm gonna go in on my first bag here the gorilla glue live resin or brass monkey here in San Diego definitely keep an eye out for brass monkey concentrates this stuff Cheers [Music] that point of the flavours I I expect from gorilla blue mm-hmm but again just a little bit more earthy almost like a little bit more indica yeah you could probably see I am sweating a bucket right now it's because I'm right here on the coast here in San Diego and it is hot oh yeah mmm definitely some high THC levels on this grill ooh kind of an interesting consistency on it it's somewhere between like a sugar a nut and a honeycomb I want to say like it almost had kind of a yeah like a like a honey which is consistency a I feel like I don't really see any more but yeah like a honeycomb II kind of sugar definitely smelling really loud I haven't tried they're cheaper stuff this stuff I think the live resins from brass monkey are usually found for around 50 $60 retail and the cheaper stuffs usually like 3040 but I've probably cruised for this live or isn't if you can find it generally speaking I usually try not to buy under $40 a gram for concentrative just because you can get into some sketchy trimmer and territory that being said still really quality products all the way up and down the product line from brass monkey here first ad tour me back yeah usually when I'm chiefing on glue mmm I I don't really all right I do have get this very confused kind of effective it's not so much like confused in a negative way but it's definitely kind of a non-functional high for me I feel like I'm really high on gorilla glue not gonna be doing a whole lot of multitasking I mean it's definitely kind of in the category of like a head [ __ ] I would say yeah but that being said a really nice terpene profile on it it translates into a full melt really well as well as beachy I think it's just a really good genetic for concentrates in general okay yeah this brass monkey gorilla glue is really potent I would say definitely leans more towards the potency side versus just like a super trippy sauce or something this has got a heavy THC content and I'm not really feeling the slapped and the brain effective gorilla glue from this I'm almost kind of getting more of an indica effect off of it like I detected in the smell it's really just not the most woody kind of gorilla glue I think it's more of an indica cut or Fino yeah I'm really diggin it and it was definitely a really good first impression try a dank live present from brass monkey so yeah they're going on the second time here guys Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] earthy woody chocolatey mmm easily yeah glue clunk probably noticing a little bit of a change in setup here mm-hmm I stopped using my phone to report these videos so thank you hopefully from this point onward from now on I'll be using a DSLR mm with a rode video mic sorry for disappearing on you guys mmm doing this show week after week for I don't want to say no reward it's definitely been rewarding I've met a lot of awesome people and you know I mean the future is bright I'm really looking forward to it too reviewing a lot more concentrates absolutely but currently at this particular moment in time it's difficult for me to spend a lot of time on stuff like this if I'm not getting some kind of payment or money or something so I don't want to sell you guys [ __ ] you know I think I said that before like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna review like some subscription box or something like kill me before that that big comes just gets a little bit of to be a little bit of a drag week after week after week so yeah I'm gonna work on that again I really do want to be weekly with this show and there's really no excuse for me not to be so I think having an easier set up here this this setting this up to shoot this took me like half as much time so iron I think that will encourage me to to film a little bit more because yeah setting up in my room was a pain in the ass let me tell you but yeah this uh this press monkey chronically alive present is a serious treat if you can get your hands on it here in San Diego I mentioned previously in the review that they're live resins are a little bit harder to find they are generally in the 50 60 dollar price range not 80 which is really cool for a single source live arisen but yeah they're they're definitely known for their cheaper trim runs the they I think they even go all the way down to like 20 30 $40 you know grand it's just cheaper stuff but yeah it's nice that they also have a live present and they're still coming in at an affordable price and yeah slight business on point alright so yeah guys that that is gonna wrap up this review of the brass monkey gorilla glue live resin and organic live resin the one people's choice highest potency here at the cannabis farmers market I need to get out more to local events guys if you've gone to local events in San Diego I mean I just that I really haven't really gotten out as much but I'm gonna try and fix that hopefully it cools down a little bit because the thought of going and doing stuff outside right now it's just like no thanks it's a way to humid but um yeah guys sorry again it disappeared for so long I will definitely be filming more regularly and that's gonna wrap up this episode of trippy Tuesday it's been trippy Tuesday episode 54 reviewing at the brass monkey gorilla glue live resin hey guys I'll talk to you next week peace [Music]", "zbAY763zt4M": "[Music] hi there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "5s3biq7vd7E": "have you ever wondered how cannabis manufacturers get marijuana into a vapor pen the solution is terpenes connoisseur concentrates has created an organic chirping solution that is used to turn any cannabis extract into a liquid that can be used in any vapor pen you start by taking a cannabis extract like shatter wax or crumble and measure out a gram you then add approximately 0.5 grams of the solution to the extract gently heat stir and you have a vape ready product industrial manufacturers through the exact same thing on a larger scale manufacturers

the corner and uh I just happen to a couple flower I think go nuts with the order today I need me and soma see what comes in throughout the week into a new stuff comes in and then I'll probably pick up some more stuff s'mores bruised but uh I did pick up a strain that's already been out that III missed I thought my god I'm having some deja vu 1rx thought I already did the review on but apparently I didn't say it had me I said it didn't but whoever [ __ ] knows but we got it is the Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions yeah I'm at cakes [ __ ] those girl cookies hit Mass I figure one good turn deserves another right so I pick up their cutter the East Coast Sour Diesel now by all means if you realized and because I looked I hadn't seen that I thought I did some time the East Coast Sour Diesel maybe it was somebody else's East Coast Sour Diesel I think was the East Coast saudis across with tanga third planet or something like that maybe that's what it was but greatly I'm just on the regular East Coast I'll use a flower itself so here it is not from Connecticut on acidic solution of these weird I matter some days I do with the shake the sweet I did but apparently didn't anyways grab myself a couple cookies because every no last man had some sleep issues and that [ __ ] sucks like going out of stock colonizers and then maybe senators grab some of this what this is called is the UM the saunder see Connecticut family silica solutions CT firemen sativa sander and as you can see it's twenty six percent I'm sorry twenty four percent change THC and it's a sativa which is nice because I mean is you seen all the products and had last last week were straight in because I've been in to cut out so I could use a good Steven plus I have a pretty badass movie to watch from red box to picked up the home the new Mission Impossible movie rogue nation his wife he's down there getting the [ __ ] blu-ray player all hooked up ready to go and we're about to get a movie out so let me not make her hold up too long when we get my medication has like a nice like almost like a creamy lemon even Ellis Bell like a real soft soft lemon with a soft lemon real soft that soft isn't like the smell soft is real loud it's a lot of [ __ ] smell it's just a soft like smooth like creamy like lemon meringue like pie crust Laver and uh looks like ol shitload of tiny mini buds okay like almost looks like some [ __ ] second cut [ __ ] but family it's not um sit let's see we get my hundreds a little tiny buds to lead off okay Jesus Christ there's probably like so all [ __ ] little tiny mini buds it's like [ __ ] a hundred month table so yeah that's a solder eastcoast our D and as you get in on that little ray magic I'm gonna want to feel the buds you just see all and I mean look as you get in look we don't just write all over the place and it's like it going to you're going to it you see all the trikes all over it the bright night weight braced nice and level a nice bright white

can pack a lot of punch smell wise like I said still gonna soft lemon Rican off the table but look at all the tricks that's really nice looking nice I mean let's just go it does yeah and I said it I'm just gonna do a probably two quick balls with you we'll just grab that that those little three eyes and this little thread of me all right here that's what Medicaid had East Coast's our D what the East Coast our D is it's just another cup of Sour Diesel more or less I mean with strain strain lineage itself it's a Sour Diesel it might possibly be cut with something else like but I honestly honestly honestly couldn't find any lineage background I know all I guys for parent strains is just just Sour Diesel so I'm just assuming it's like it off cut or a different type phenome of the Sour Diesel itself like we hid all the [ __ ] little but there's so many of them holy [ __ ] um which we called but yeah that's basically it is it's our date it's our DS East Coast our D there's a New York Sour Diesel there's [ __ ] Sour Diesel there's all kinds of different deal cuts this is the East Coast Sour Diesel so and again remember Connecticut farmer again the reason these buds are so small this might be have a lot of it to is because again remember this is all soil grown naturally organic Cilla ground all Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions Medicaid are also about they're the only ones in Connecticut doing it whatever be else pretty much I'm like a hydroponic type status and I that's something definitely keep in mind when you're purchasing arising cuz it does have a different effect a different flavor and just a whole different quality and not in a bad way by any means so many all people just prefer that they just really like flowers that are growing in dirt from the earth a little more natural very organic and smell this when you break it up is very loud goes from that soft lemon too hard funk late to that real fuelie smell that tingles and burns and also big-time big-time so remember soft lemon initially you cracked this [ __ ] open and you see how angry it gets I'm just freaking out it out you should [ __ ] like well you can smell the potency in this now when you crack that opening I go Jesus Christ you tell it's gonna come at you so I'm excited about that back two balls here we want movie on get my mission if possible and that's good a good night we're

six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "KP-_EfWkCKo": "hey everyone this is tech crazy today's video is going to be review for blue dream by station house um this is sativa it's a six pack of pre-rolls i got and uh very nice very nice daytime smoke a little bit expensive not too expensive nice size joints but i um have for me it's very smooth you kind of gotta wipe these joints or they'll canoe all over the place i think it tastes like blueberries smoke one of my favorites it also takes away all your pain so if you're doing computer working backings stuff like that this stream will help see it's canoeing it's good to wet the tip before you learn this one is like a mid-range price uh one and they're pre-rolled i think was 30 bucks i'm gonna give this one a 4.8 um i really like the effects i don't get too stoned from it i'm actually not very buzzed from it more or less it took away all my pain and helped me relax i put any information i can in the video i can't really tell you much more about it it's just pretty basic you", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "ZfmnEWR-2Zw": "Hey what's up this is Drew, owner of\nConnoisseur Concentrates. We're back to do another Terpene Profile Breakdown\nvideo. As usual I am joined by my Chief Lab Technician; Professor Matsumoto (Wassup), my Media Director; Audrey (Hi), and today we're going to be doing a profile\nbreakdown video on the Sour Diesel. The Sour Diesel is the second terpene\nprofile that I created as a company. Early in the industry, and the creation\nof terpenes for labor pens, this was the second one that came through, it's really good. It's not as complex as our newer profiles, but it's still a winner, it's\nstill- it's still working hard and doing a good job, and we sell tons of this\nstuff, alright? So, Sour Diesel has a parent\nlineage from Chemdawg and Super Skunk. And we happen to have a Super Skunk\nterpene profile as well. It's a sativa blend. And I don't know, I\nreally like it, it's- it's, having said that, I've made some more diesel blends in our\nlater generations. And I think the later diesel blends are far more complex, and\nsuperior than the Sour Diesel. I know that the Sour Diesel is one of our early\nblends. It's gonna be a simpler profile, without as many flavors, but it's still good.\nPeople do still like it, and people do still order it, so I would recommend-\nI'd recommend at least trying it. It's good. Okay so, one of the first things\nyou're gonna notice about this strain is that it's clear, bottle of it right there.\nThat's because it is made from all organic terpenes. There is nothing\nsynthetic, and nothing artificial in this blend. One of the first things you're\ngonna do when you purchase the bottle, or you think about purchasing it, is you're\ngonna want to smell it, so I'm gonna let you smell this through me, ready? So, it's very citrusy, and\ntruthfully it tastes like- it tastes like a lemonhead. Remember the candy Lemonheads? That's- that's what it smells like. It's got a\nvery clear, crisp, vibrant smell, with the citrus- the citrus is predominant in it. Doesn't smell like weed. It smells a lot like a lemon head, that's really, really\nwhat it smells like. But as I tell everybody; you should never really buy\nterpenes based on what the bottle smells like, for a very simple reason. And if you\nwant more go watch the video on why you shouldn't do that. I've done\nanother video, we're trying to link to it. Terpenes are made, terpene blends like\nthis, are made from usually 10 to 20 different terpenes. Not all them have the\nsame evaporation temperatures. So, when you smell a bottle you're smelling what\nfew terpenes are evaporating off at room temperature, 70 degrees. It's not gonna\ngive you an accurate profile if they were built correctly. You're gonna smell\nsomething different from those combinations then you're gonna taste in\nthe pen. And I'll let Audrey explain a little bit more about that. Yeah, right, so\nthe most important thing to keep in mind here is; don't be a terpene rookie. We\nhave coined that term for people who smell the bottle, and taste the pen, and\nexpect it to be exactly the same. It's not. That's what makes our product\nbetter. We've spent hours formulating these terpenes so that the end-user, your\nclient, will have that authentic taste, not the smell from your bottle at the\ncounter. True that. So, make sure that you're not a terp rookie and you need to only buy\nyour terpenes based on what they taste like, because your customer will be\ntasting your pen. Your customer will never smell your terpene bottle. Luckily\nthat's why the professor is here. He is gonna taste that pen for you already\nmixed up and tell you exactly what it tastes like, what your customers are\ngonna experience. As Drew said before; made up a Sour Diesel pen right here,\ntell you exactly what it tastes like. I'm getting a certain fresh, crispness\ninitially, followed by a light, pungent citrus note. It's very refreshing, wow.\nIt's cool. It is a good profile. Again like I said, it's one of our earlier\nprofiles. I really think that if you were gonna use this, you should mix it with\nsome of our other stuff. I think that you can create your own terpenes by taking\nsome of our other blends and mixing our blends together. You can almost never\nmess that up. This is a great ingredient, on something else. So one of the ways\nthat we describe terpene profiles, are whether they're separated or blended,\nthat means that; in a separated profile; you're first gonna taste, maybe citrus,\nand then you taste earth, and then you taste something else at the end. In a\ncombined profile; you're gonna taste all those flavors together, all the way\nthrough the inhale and the exhale. Where does the Sour Diesel fall? I would\ncategorize Sour Diesel as a separated profile, meaning that initially, you're\ngonna get that very crisp, clean flavor, followed by a pungent, citrus notes. And\nyeah, it's- it's really good. I failed to mention this a little bit earlier, but\nSour Diesel is categorized as a medium cannabis profile, meaning that the\ncannabis notes are gonna be right in line with that light, crisp, pungent,\ncitrus. So, the key- the level that you taste cannabis is different from how\nstrong the profile is. There's a cannabis strength and a profile strength. Cannabis strength is; how much does it taste like weed. Profile strength is; how\nstrong is this profile, you know six drops of this profile versus another\nprofile. Where does the strength of this profile lay? So this profile in particular, is\ncategorized in our medium strength, which means it's not going to be too\noverpowering, but it's definitely gonna be there. Definitely, enhancing? While I'm\nasking? Right, so another thing we categorize- use to categorize our terpenes; is whether or not they are a profile masking agent or a enhancing agent,\nmeaning that on that exhale, when you're smoking, it's the difference between it\nbeing enhanced with the cannabis aroma, or it being completely covered up like you\nwould with like Bubblegum or Fruity Pebbles. Where does this one lie? And this one lies in our enhancement, which means those cannabis notes are just gonna be\nlaced throughout there, instead of covered.

Bye.", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "EnHRHRpTjsk": "[Music] hey everyone thanks for stopping by I'm Dave and today we have something really cool this is a super Silver Haze vape cartridge from honeybee testing out at just over 85 percent and with the price tag of fifteen dollars I'm very interested to see the quality of this oil

beautiful amber color now let's see how that bubble murmurs now this is what I really like to see at room temperature this bubble does not move always a great sign now let's go ahead and check out

you join me next time and until then just have an awesome day [Music] [Music]", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "l7PHGUHdhNc": "story this evening an empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit

all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to

cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "0dmClHXQ9X0": "hey what up yo this is too short I'm up here in hotnewhiphop I'm going to show you [Music] [Applause] [Music] I buy this way from a dispensary in LA demence tree from my studio it just so happens they nicknamed this brand Illuminati that's what it's kind of that's pretty goddamn good no yeah I'm an OG guy and not because it's the word oh gee but I just really liked the OG Kush and different strands of OG Kush I really like the original cookies when it first came out put the all the water down cookies they're good and name but I like yeah you know I like flavor so even when I smoke sativas I'll talk about some Skywalker something like something I go more for the flavor than like I want so either get me so high I just like the flavor I'm not really big on edibles unless it's like like an assorted sleeping pill environment like I'm trying to get some rest or just relax I don't can't do edibles in public no I haven't had a bad experience on any drugs ever I'm like I'm really like I either have a high tolerance or I just have the presence of mind not to do too much of whatever I'm doing so a lot of people love that diesel that Sour Diesel my brother smokes to [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] but is that's like [ __ ] soda with no calories or so [ __ ] it's cool though you know I really don't like people never understand what I was saying but there's this weed that a lot of people liking to me it tastes like [ __ ] vegetables or so [ __ ] I don't know what the finally not explain it I can smell them all the way I know I never like to hit it unless it's the only weed in the existence but I don't like it everybody I hang with their smokes smokes they went from Swisher's - you know Swisher's and [ __ ] all those old blunts to the now to the backwoods and and the Leafs and all that so we have the [ __ ] weekly debate about what's better but my philosophy is I smoke joints too that's what I always smoke and when blunts came out well they first when I first got turned on the blood it was probably 92 maybe somewhere in there maybe well in the 92 yeah I thought of the dumbest [ __ ] in the world like I to this day I still think it's kind of stupid man like you take like maybe not the leaf but [ __ ] a blunt like you take a tobacco product and you take the tobacco out of it which you first and foremost you're supporting the tobacco company but you're not even using their product you just want the [ __ ] paper and then you smoke them just the tobacco residue or weed and you you have all these piles of like tobacco laying everywhere you drop them on the floor they fall out to ash tray you fill up the ashtray with tobacco it's in every trashcan the world smells like the [ __ ] then you smoke the bluffs and you [ __ ] you lose like it don't even taste like weed it's like I don't get it man I get the fact that if there's a bunch of heads trying to share it burns better yeah but you know you smoke this junk I'm not letting everybody [ __ ] the room in it I really the first time I smoked some weed it was some fake ass weed a little cheap ass with my brother I was youngest [ __ ] and I hate to [ __ ] like two times and I started pretending like I was drunk and my brother kept saying [ __ ] faking like faking it I thought I was supposed to act that way but some I didn't really like take the weed right away some years later probably like high school I became I was like a high school smoker I am you know it was it was like a lunchtime type of thing you know we just some we like in Oakland you could buy a joint like a pre road joint for a dollar like you could buy three drinks for - that was just some [ __ ] like that it was in the early 80s that was a thing I haven't did a little stand of selling some joints I used to sell joints to get extra money like you could buy a a five or ten dollar bangle we all right I'm gonna take the trade a five dollar version you could buy when I was in high school I could have five dollars in my pocket literally likes to sell cassette tapes and all these little husband's and I could just like not be broke so for weed money I was like okay it'd be early in the morning I'm not getting out to sell tape ship before the school so I take five dollars I go to the homies housewife right on the bag of weed I break the weed down and I roll up maybe like twelve joints so I could sell you three for to like get me to like 84 like I just I just anything to make double to get $10 back or some [ __ ] like that so and you just like just walk through the day like that man I go to Radio Shack and buy a three cassette tapes a little cheap tapes of something for like $2.99 you get three tapes and I go duplicate some [ __ ] and go sell those three tapes for five dollars a pop and I'd be selling a little bit couple joints on the way and it's always have money and anyone a [ __ ] work fast food and then like this you know do you have any rollin tips I know I don't like to use tips I really know but it always argued with me about the [ __ ] tip rollin the putting the little crutches in there and glass tips I'm like oh I'll just I'm from the day we use it rollin joint and smoke us up we argue about the blunts and the joints I've compromised somewhere along the line but 20 years ago maybe a little longer than that I stopped smoking zigzags and I started smoking the Rizla which is a is some kind of licorice flavored paper or something that's like candy licorice but it uh it only serves one purpose with me cuz I could smell raw papers I could smoke zigzags I just smoked these because I hang around a lot of blood smokers and it just kind of eases their whole psyche of me not smoking a joint so nobody really notices when you smoke brown joints versus I can I could break out a pack of zigzags or a pack of raw papers they like oh you smoke them joint since this car man it's always somebody notices if you smoke these it's just you just blend in and people go let me hit that blend them like miles personal homie and can't get this one I like to roll no crutches no none of that stuff I like and actually people say they like to put the crutch of the tip in there stick your smoke all the way right but I don't do that because I love the doobie world you know like I love my roaches I love to like that moment where it's very rare but that moment where you just don't have we or the weed that in the room at the moment is kind of shitty I'm like you know what I got some [ __ ] doobies from like good weed that's better than [ __ ] y'all smoking I'm just gonna tap into my doobies and smoke that I love it so you get you get big doobies than when I roll it so my technique is some people just they've even joint smokers they be like don't [ __ ] use a lot of [ __ ] paper like they were a big fat ass joint with one paper I do the one-and-a-half technique cuz I'm I like it to burn a certain way so I was like they'll have to pay forward and I tend to I don't do it always but people say do you realize you just rolled a joint without looking in like four seconds and like dinner it's something I I don't need to I could roll a joint in the rain with no umbrella outdoors tending in the rain with no one brother a lot I'm talking on the phone I can roll the joint while I'm driving a stick shift and traffic talking on the phone seriously and pull it off you have on these pop it open just keep it on you just hose one blunt one joint mmm but y'all smell it fast you pop that up when I wrote this ever and you need to see it is like a [ __ ] magician so this is another thing I want to show you the weed before I rolled it because it was about the same amount of weeds you might put in the blunt but the only thing is you're gonna smoke all that tobacco and all that extra [ __ ] paper and pass it all around everybody in the room and I'm just this right here I could uh I could smoke that I could smoke that thing all day like in like I'm not a [ __ ] Snoop Dogg smoker when we blaze all day this just like a little leftover in one of these I've been smoking on this all day I just hit it three four times four or five times put it out keep a little pre-roll on me ready to go somewhere you know my infamous move is uh I don't excuse myself I just disappeared and I find like you know be somewhere like real corporate or something and I'll be in the staircase smoking hella weed any [ __ ] where before the airport is got outside we used to do it at the airport before before the Gulf War [Music]", "MI2X_aQJicg": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another cart this time my special glow extracts they did their first special cart with the Black Mamba 24 and now they're back with a wafers glow extracts they also released a watermelon og which had watermelon designs and another wafers flavor and the sour patch kids which I will be getting my hands on and definitely reviewing but just the packaging just started off I love this the waffle cone design the pink in pink in tan I love that bottom glow top wafers let's look at some of the changes they made recently as you can see now at the bottom says glow extracts I got this before and I was kind of confused I thought it was a fake for a moment but they have changed this officially since then and I am so glad they did this when I when I saw this on their Instagram or on their on their snapchat story I was hype real see cell as always claw has been some of the most consistent carts really out there really the only carts you can know for sure that they are real their Instagram is right there they also have a website where they post all of their lab results if you have to don't want to go see them love this packaging now over to the cart this I noticed I'm not sure if this is just a mistake or on purpose but this this cart seems to be a bit darker than normal not sure if they use different kind of terpenes or something but this is a wafers cart of course which is you know like vanilla wafers in this and it tastes this is definitely not a fruit if for if you love fruity carts this is not for use is it taste savory it tastes a little syrupy it it does represent wafers well and you should definitely try one of these get my fingerprints all over it but they always knock it out of the park with their collaborations and really any any other flavors are really true to the actual flavor even with their normal flavors so definitely check glow extracts out if you have never tried one of their carts you're missing out to be honest check out the channel for other videos I got videos tons of videos just like this and yeah later", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it

what that means it means it is another cartridge review here on wheat that's right guys we're gonna be reviewing another cartridge and weights in case you're wondering if this is the first time you've tuned in first of all welcome thanks for joining us and also we are a marijuana review show we review mostly edibles but we also review cartridges we review team shares we review capsules mostly we stay away from the button concentrates but everything else all that was prepackaged goods everything in a bottle everything in a package everything in a bag everything in a ziplock that's what we're here for we'll learn the bud and the concentrates to the professionals but when it's amateur hour it's time for wheats so as I said it is time for another cartridge review so what are we looking at today today on today's review we are going to be taking a look at the pretty blatant I think ripoff at least design aesthetically wise of black brass knuckles we are taking a look at their uh their what would you say their competitor their homage distributor and that is heavy hitters that's right we are taking a look at heavy hitters today I know it looks a lot like brass knuckles and pretty much every metric but it is not brass knuckles it is heavy hitter a 1 gram cartridge the Jack Herer here today Jack Herer sort of my go-to on the cartridges I love the Jack Herer strain it's my favorite sativa strain my favorite strain period is Gorilla Glue number four I think and that is an indica but I always like to do the cartridges as sativas as opposed to indicas because I like to take them during the day although it is night now and I am about to go to bed so perhaps an indica would have been a better result but now I'm still looking forward to the heavy hitters Jack Herer on the back you can see it's uh I similarly potent two brass knuckles got 91% uh cannabinoids there 87 percent THC and 0.9% CBD as you can see it's not a cheap cartridge Grenaa dime paying the Longbeach tax everything in Long Beach is a little bit more expensive which I have been paid in 1/2 dispensaries here in Long Beach and to to have one that is a block away that I can just walk to in two minutes is pretty pretty damn awesome um so as I said this is the Jack Herer uh and with 87 percent THC it should hit pretty hard so let's go ahead and open this up and take a look at the cartridge itself in terms of packaging pretty basic not ugly by any stretch of the imagination I would say perfunctory um I've certainly seen nicer and more opulent and extravagant packaging for these cartridges before sometimes I like it sometimes I think it's a bit of a waste in terms of how nice the packaging is it's like this is a disposable product guys I'm not going to be repackaging in the selling and up selling this to somebody else I don't think you need to invest that much of my dollars to you in your packaging so this is a nice simple little perfunctory package a little wall tag there so let's go ahead and open it up and take a look at the cartridge itself I like the cartridge already glass body all the way through probably aluminum tip I like the aluminum I like the glass so much better than plastic when they just use plastic for all the materials and your standard-issue rubber caps here doesn't appear to have any leaks or anything through it and it does look like a solid grand some really nice-looking oil in there really nice-looking oil very clear very Wow I like the way that looks quite a bit looks quite tasty so this is a standard 510 thread so it just goes on your 510 battery which I'll go ahead and screw in here and uh now as you guys will see oh I think I had mentioned the price yeah Long Beach tax sixty dollars for the gram there did get a discount uh for there's like percent off but this is not a the cheapest cartridge out there you're going to be paying for it so let's go ahead and take ourselves a draft that is nice Wow nice easy draft as you can see makes big clouds it's nice and easy to barely feel it coming in the coffin is on me not on them weak lungs the sensitive lungs but really um did not burn hot do not burn too bright just gotta my lungs felt great ventilation was nice and clean and easy and again the draw is nice and simple you don't have to really you know pull at it it comes right out and it's taste it is on point as well not my favorite Jack Herer taste ever but certainly better than average and and I would say even good but perhaps isn't complete with like that the orchid in terms of taste but so far I'm pretty impressed with this let's go ahead and talk about potency let me give another draw here Wow Wow I'm liking this a bit quite a bit so now potency the most important part well I'm feeling it I'm definitely feeling it this feels like it might actually be 87 percent THC as advertised I am feeling pretty high already in the four to sort of five level which for me and a cartridge is pretty good growing up on edibles uh you know it takes a lot to get me super super super high but this is a good good level of medication for just a couple of draws for me I'm really pleased with it Wow tasty um so far this is it going to get a recommendation for me I'm liking this heavy hitter quite a bit here this this is much better than the pen I just reviewed I just reviewed carvanha and it is a stark difference between the two in terms of taste potency and quality of cartridge but what advise you guys as always stick around for the last part of this review cuz I'm gonna be coming back to you once I finish this cartridge as I always do so I'll be coming back to you in the next you know four or five six days and letting you know exactly how this cartridge held up up those days whether my opinion has changed or evolved in any way I will be sure to let you know and it's going to be on this video in just a couple of seconds and for me guys I will see you in a few days thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace welcome back to guys it has been four days since I last checked in with you on our heavy hitters review our Jack Herer heavy hitters review that is for a secondary I almost said brass knuckles they're so similar that my brain had them kind of switched up there that being said I think this is of similar quality to brass knuckles and this is a really really good product I like this quite a bit this is this is some high quality stuff at least in my estimation so I think I might have in the last video spoken about the price with a slightly critical tone I don't mean that at all I think I take that back if that's if that's the case um I paid 60 bucks for this which is admittedly quite expensive but that's also because of the area that I'm in and yadda-yadda and so forth so on and so forth um but that's I think the same as I paid maybe for the curve on a cartridge the one gram carbonic cartridge and this is so so much better than I mean this is night and day difference so for that price I mean this is this is great for you again you're probably gonna find this in a better hopefully you're gonna find this at a better price than what I paid for it but I'm not dissatisfied at all with what I paid for it um I love the cartridge design itself really easy to draw from never got difficult to pull from high-quality materials like the glass tip I like the excuse me the metal tip and then the glass case and as you can see you can extract all the oil from it it's just a really fantastic design I mean it's nothing crazy outrageous or you know revolutionary but I still think it's a really really good cartridge the product got me quite high every time I mean I think I can get up to if I if I used it quite a bit I was giving up to like sixes at points which for cartridges is really good especially for me like that's that's good stuff and it it tasted great for the most part now my only complaint with it and this is not really a big complaint because this is true for most cartridges I've only seen a few exceptions I don't exactly know why this is if somebody understands the science of it please let me know but I don't really know why this happens but on a lot of cartridges the closer you get to the to the bottom the closer it comes to running out the harsher the drawers get they hits harder in the lungs it's it's hotter in the lungs and then the the the taste goes out the window it almost has like a burnt kind of taste to it which makes sense with the sort of harsher taste or the harsher draw and this one this one suffers from that it's not as bad as sorry to harp on qurbana it's not come on it's not a terrible product by any stretch but I've got a fresh on the brain right now it's not quite as bad as that but it does suffer from that once you get down to the the super low levels but then again you know it's once you get to that point it's you know it's probably with maybe five to ten percent left so it's not like it's you know affecting a whole lot and you you you could very well just throw it away once it starts to get harshing you're really not throwing away much product at all you're not out a lot so outside of that small complaint I loved this one this is a great one the heavy hitters Jack Herer couldn't be happier with it easily in my we've only done I don't know you know ten cartridge reviews or something at this point I'm not sure how many Woodall released this one at what level but this is this is certainly you know top three probably for me so far so I'm really enjoyed this one guys and I've really enjoyed talking to you and reviewing this one with you thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "U8WmRBnQRns": "oh [ __ ] how you guys doing

really good like tropical mints that's what it smells like a little bit of minty a little bit of tropicalness very little gas just um oh man just look at her she is fired this [ __ ] ain't no instagram model she don't play this straight up supermodel right here uh constellation hash company out here 502 headed up by head hunter extracts he's the main extractor there he's been in the game quite a while he's back in the game even before i was in the hashmaking game in the medical field here in washington but me and him we're in the same game together we've worked with some of the same people uh dude's real solid guy shout out to him head hunter thanks for putting out some heat for washington brother uh but yeah let's get into this dab you guys are having a great day what are you guys smoking on man i ain't seen no comments you just gotta tell me what you're smoking on um but yeah let's get this dabbing let's get tarpy terpy friday got that fire friday all right wow ah [Music] oh already everywhere that's a body wrap [Music] finish i grow up oh man soaked up a little bit of water tasting whoa flavor's nice subtle sweet taste it on your tongue tasting the terps taste some tarps you know what's funny about these uh q-tips so my dog terp you don't like smoke you don't like i mean you like smelling weed and stuff like he's interested in that but he does not like smoke like he hates smoke it's understandable but these q-tips ain't worth this [ __ ] when they're just regular q-tips but man you get that uh leftover burnt oil activated oil that's been a bit activated in there for now oh boy you catch that little [ __ ] in the corner with one there's none on it i'm just like tarpy like what are you doing man and then he's done for the day i mean he goes and lays down in bed kicks back and he's just like so that's how her tarps really tarpy he likes his tarps you just don't smoke him he eats his terps eats their own eats their own oh let's keep tipping that banger oh guys cushman's constellation cannabis sub x another eight out of ten this one [Music] flavor processing all of it's at least a seven out of eight [Music] high not all that strong nice chill i still nothing to put you for you down but i give it like a six maybe seven seven for a high it's cool though i like it i'm chill i can talk to you i mean you guys can see in previous videos how much cannabis influences me when i smoke it uh sometimes i don't see that in other people i've been smoking for years like just 74 since i was 13 35 now you know it's funny you should just get high still good and stuff am i in my 30s man everything started changing like let me know if you guys noticed this stuff like you guys ever smoke so long that you notice years later like oh damn the strain or the way it was grown now don't get me wrong strains all have independent terpenes and the effects but when we have people that are always pulling things early or not pushing the plant to its full potential it's just kind of like you're only getting some of the psychoactiveness that comes with it you only get like that uh high anxiety like heart race [Music] everybody's like oh it's a sativa sometimes it's it's not probably seven times out of ten it's not even if it is a sativa i mean there's sativas that will space you out so hard and you won't know what hit you and there's sativas that will make your heart race and make you think you're having a heart attack [Music] but when the plant's grown and the resin isn't to its full potential in full maturity um you start getting those lesser desired effects in my opinion i personally like heads that are a little more amber in color because that's when you know they're good today we're getting a lot of heads that are clear and white and you're seeing that super white beach sand bubble hash or the [ __ ] super gold bubble house or the super light in color almost white level hatch and aussie let's do [Music] uh prachum not maturing and honestly it's okay i mean some flavor comes out better that way in some aspects but you know you kind of why not drop some of what you like but you get full uh full spectrum full grown uh full time or full sun full term plants wow that's a different experience man uh you want to talk about getting stoned i mean that's what that's what put you down this is very good though nice chill i like it just kind of cruising to the music but yeah that's my thoughts in my experience with all that uh do one more tab with y'all i mean i can't really get enough of this stuff it's just you just want to eat it it's like tasty terps [Music] all right turbans little turbans i don't think i'm gonna go with the name tarp anymore i don't know why i actually used it uh it's because my dog's name is turt i like saying terp a lot let's go with my old [ __ ] uh nickname smoke uh so i'll be like what up guys it's smoke here to get smoked out or whatever i don't [ __ ] know some [ __ ] like that but it's better using my real name my opinion real name is kade kind of uh doesn't roll off the tongue to me i don't know [ __ ] it [Music] together all right guys hope you have a good rest of your day let's get lifted stay high stay medicated uh [Music] oh baby a little more oh get that banger done let me know if there's a stuff you like about the videos stuff you want to see i don't know i sound like a broken record but i don't really wanna hear what you guys don't want to think don't want to see what you all think criticism's great i'm going gonna criticize myself i wanna stop saying um um i hate the damn work oh oh when the terps get you oh [ __ ] guys i hope you have a great rest your day i'm gonna stop repeating myself but uh shout out constellation cannabis so dude excitement washington sir i 502 products pick them out up at your local dispensary in washington state [ __ ] it stay turpy stay high stay lifted uh have a good night", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "duKNE8y28yA": "it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes

that video or actually while i was making the video and told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see how cheap these [ __ ] carts he's doing because these are real i want to know how [ __ ] cheap does it really get i'm going to call him real

cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "iZANcFns6GM": "[Music] what's up everybody p2 peeps here and today we've got our honey leaf northern lights cartridge review um i'll put i'll be sure to put some close-up shots uh so you guys can actually you know see the packaging and all that stuff but yeah it's an indica strain we're working with about five milligrams of thc here and 85 thc uh i'm not sure if you guys can get the color of this very well but it's a very nice light golden color maybe not super gold it's actually more of a clear color so uh yeah really impressed with the color of uh just the oil you know it looks really clean and uh i have had a taste of it already so i am impressed with the flavor but you know how we do on this review we're gonna go ahead and take a hit together and i let you guys know what i'm tasting and what i'm feeling on it so for those of you at home come on you know the drill pack a bowl pack a dab get your pen ready all that good stuff boys yeah cheers like i said before i don't know if anyone was there on the live stream where i did unbox this it's got a really nice flavor profile in terms of variation we don't get that often with distillate oils and i'm really surprised to say that excuse me you've got a nice wide spectrum of flavor here it's not super deep but it's there we've got a little pineness some uh some lemoniness in there too a little tang of that citrus in there not too much of a sweetness actually there is a tiny tiny bit of sweetness but yeah a lot of pineness a little a little pepperiness in there too it's definitely touching on almost all the notes of terps that i can really pick up but let's go ahead and take another hit and uh discuss the flavors a little more you know maybe i'm tripping in um you know misa calling a flavor or something you know miss mistasting it i guess is another word to say but yeah i hope you guys are ready for another one if you're not pause that video because i'm about to take a hit cheers okay there it is so you guys know that uh kind of like a roasty weed flavor that you can sometimes pick up in some cartridges if you guys have anything from bright labs or anything from or not anything reversal but my last two ursa cartridges had that kind of flavor so yeah some bright labs carts have that versa absolute extracts and i guess this honey leaf one does too it's got kind of like a toasty not roasty more like a toasted uh cannabis flavor if you've ever vaped a cannabis before you definitely know what i'm talking about it's like that slight little roast when you that you first get from the uh from the plant you know so like when you're uh if you have a volcano or an air riser or a paxo or any of the handheld uh vaporizers it's like probably like the midway point taste that you can get so like when your flower is like halfway through being vaped all the way through that's that's the kind of flavor that i'm picking up here yeah um really impressed with the potency of this oil guys uh for about like i think this was forty dollars it's not bad for a gram not bad at all we get grams of anywhere from thirty dollars to ninety dollars i mean not me but i'm saying like as a whole in our market right so it's pretty nice to be able to you know pick and choose the different brands but it's also hard to find out what ones are you know making clean products making potent products or pricing things aptly i think for forty dollars this is right on the money and for 50 bucks i i think it's not too bad for a distillate but if you can find a live resin for 50 i'm definitely going to be choosing a live resin over a distillate but this is some good stuff guys you know i've had a few days to sit around with this and test it out and i really like it so far i wouldn't say it's one of my favorites but uh it could it could certainly make its way there you know i'll definitely be doing comparisons between this distillate and you know other high quality distillates such as platinum vapes or even the buddies one but yeah we'll see i'll take one more hit here for you guys and um yeah cheers [Music] yeah this is definitely really nice especially that added the added cbd in there definitely makes it a lot smoother um on the inhale but thank you guys for watching if you guys enjoyed as always please leave that like drop a comment let me know what you think about honey leaf you know would you guys like to see more of this stuff or you know another bargain brand for our next video we'll see what's up you know just leave that comment down

right real quick I'll show you I got this honey leaf cart some Northern Lights it's a gram and it was 40 bucks from my dispensary and I just got it right after I had that great drink I put the grape drink cut info for the purple drink info up on the the page on the description turns out it was a canvassed as purple cut that I was telling you about which could be granddaddy it could be one of the purple Barney's and it was cross with unstable Girl Scout and that it kind of stabilized it you know to make a good grape drink but I'm calling a grape Frank it's purple drink I'm calling it great Frank on accident I'm messing up it's purple drink but I accidentally call it grape drink because the other brand that I had it was a great trick but that one wasn't good so this one is called purple drink right here in front of me we've got the honey leaf car and it's Northern Lights I ordered gelato but they're all out of the gelato and so I got this one because it was the next highest HD in line so I'll look at the back of it real quick 85 percent that's pretty good so to use this I just literally have a Korova unrivaled battery put it right there press the button one two three or one two one two three four five to turn it on and then one two to do the 15 second preheat and then you press one two three to change the settings one two three one two three now it's white one two three now it's blue one two three one two three it changed the heat setting and three four five turn it off so that's pretty much how you can tell that's what I use though for the battery and then you just charge it that in all the carts are interchangeable meaning any type of card that you pretty much buy as long as it doesn't say it's a pot or anything they're all 5 100 threads which is this size so as long as you have this type of like as long as the cart on the end has this type of thread which you'll see on the inside it'll work with any type of battery pretty much so you can buy any brand of battery it doesn't really matter as long as it's not a pot battery or like a Jeep it then you'll need the Jeep on if it's dizzy wish I got right here if it's dizzy no need to actual dizzy dizzy and you see that's what I was talking about that's actual pod its digi and it's same charger on the bottom and it doesn't have a battery as soon as you slide it in it's just hit it and go and the pods magnetic to where it slides in there on those little magnetic pieces it just stays attached to it and you just usually slide it out with a little bit of pressure but the stages are kind of weird last when I got it was supposed to be a live rat or supposed to be a cannabis derived terpenes one and it tasted like pork rinds when I got before that was granddaddy purple and it tasted like great like a [ __ ] artificial great he's just so shitty apparently Kim K's mom was all big on those and posted them a while back on Instagram and they blew up even more so everyone's all obsessed to them they're probably only big literally just because she posted them you know what everyone's obsessed about him and she probably only liked him because artificial flavor guarantee you shouldn't have pork on one no I'm open one gram now this is what I was telling everyone's dumb asked about the oil test even some good wax kind of takes a minute it doesn't go that quick like that woman and this isn't hella cold like I was telling you now we're gonna test it just for the [ __ ] idiots out there real quick now I started this probably around 4:15 right we're just gonna see it's barely starting to climb but it's still taking away because all that little stick and sticky is [ __ ] so even with the air rise and it's not enough pressure as you can see I'm not the angle I'll move it too much but we're already going on one minute the other one would have already been at the top by now if it was fake all you [ __ ] idiots and this is a yellow like honey looking tea color like not tea but I could cream to you looking color you know so I mean look at it it's just barely broke off the surface at the bottom you idiots wanted to try to try to test my knowledge so we're gonna sit here I'm gonna sit here and look at this what's that you idiots what's that what's that you idiots you saw me open it you saw me open it you saw me open it you saw me open it what's that you idiots what's that you

know nothing all right look still hasn't even touched you yet you [ __ ] maggots Oh", "AyD0arsxdII": "three two one welcome back to fourth fleet stone everyone today i got me some cherry pie got me something sweet you know more my type last train we did was the um what did we do last time we did the cereal milk the cereal milk was actually pretty good was me and my girlfriend she loved it i loved it and you know we always aim for that that we always aim for that thick that thick strain that we like i mean if we get the fruity strains we also gonna we we still do reviews on them but that's not what we really be aiming for so right now i got something that i'm i'm always aiming for which is the cherry pie i'm gonna mix it with a little the goliath gas this is the goliath gas right here that's a delta eight strain i've been dealing with the delta h lately i made a video describing delta eight and uh delta nine you know and i recently discovered that the delta eight has affected me way better than delta nine ever has it's like i feel like the delta is probably gonna be the new th probably the next two three years same level thc is gonna have it's it's constants it's compounds and the high level it gives you and the melonness is unbelievable like i can't even explain what words you definitely have to try it out it's definitely a recommendation for anybody that smokes weed and that wants a substitution for something real mellow like i know a lot of people that gets mad and blow you know i'm gonna get high i wanna get high i don't wanna i don't want delta eight i wanna do something i wanna get high i wanna get high but in reality it's all the same [ __ ] just a lower percentage of you know thc content and little do people know delta eight if you're getting your delta in from the store and you're getting your thc from whatever supply you get it from i don't know i'm not in your business but a lot of times the delta e is going to be fresher than what you're buying from the streets or wherever you're getting it it's probably going to be fresher than that because most of the delta 8 is like all that it does eat this lab test you can't can't sell delta 8 unless it's lab tested so anything that's lab tested you know i definitely recommend smoking just to to see how it makes you feel and focus on the body height more of just a psychiatric [ __ ] up high a lot of people just want to get banged up you know i'm high as hell or reality you got to focus on the health benefits and therapeutic benefits and the feeling in your body so that's what i like to do when i when i explore with different strains of delta 8 and um delta 9. but right now i'm gonna put the cherry pie in here and i got a i got a i got a gift for y'all a little surprise for you i want to pick me up some more concentration last time we did the king louie concentration now i got some pineapple express check this out come on get it zooming on this [ __ ] right here nice and fresh oh shout outs out to clyde 9 vapor they got it all at this athens california at this bumble [ __ ] where the [ __ ] you at but yeah they got it all so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna of course paint use it as a paste to paste my blunt down because that's what i always do think by now if y'all guys watching my videos y'all should know how to roll the fonzo leaf y'all should know what the [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] with brandon the link will always be in the description below i've been wowing on a glide guys i'm gonna scrape the jar the goliath guys is really kicky this [ __ ] is really resonance sticky and kicky like a lot of times cbd if you smoke with your cbd flower you're thinking that okay i'm gonna get this nice ass terpene hi going to kick me right you know you see a tv show you're like oh yeah i'm gonna photos of tv you see i'm gonna feel the income in reality you don't feel that with just the flower or just a cbd flower it's just like a it's more like a relaxation maybe a terpene kind of profile you'll get but delta eight that's your case like you're gonna feel it it's like he's gonna as soon as you smoke that she's gonna you're gonna feel it you're gonna get that kick like you smoking the real the normal [ __ ] that you would spend a lot of money for with high or high percentage of thc you're gonna feel it but five minutes later it's gonna drop and it doesn't go away it's not like a cigarette or you know just regular cbd where you smoke it five minutes later it goes away you don't feel anything you're gonna feel something it's gonna be a melody's like my girlfriend tried and she she went to sleep a lot of times she don't like to see me when she tried that [ __ ] she went straight to sleep you know that's that's that's a lot of times what you want that's the reason why we you know a lot of people smoke weed you know a lot of people have their reasons you know and some people's reasons are just to go to sleep so if you see you're smoking something and it's doing the job for you know what you need then you know you want to keep investing in that train maybe grow that shrink keep a keep a high collection of that strain you want to always focus on your trains that's why lately i've been really concentrating on different kinds of trains i smoked because back in the day it's like a whole different ballgame from back in the day back in the day i would maybe buy a train smoking blow yeah i smoked this train it got to a point where i was just buying blood and not even asking what the [ __ ] i'm buying i was just buying there's a smoke and a lot of times if you realize you're doing that you got to stop because you might end up buying the wrong thing one day and it gives you the worst time in the world and then you build this this bad conception of marijuana i know a lot of people that happen to so if you if you want to make sure you focus on your strengths and make sure you focus on seeing it in the love of cbd not everyone is affected by the same levels of cbd in the levels of chc some people can't take too much levels of thc some people can't take too much love to cbd some people need half and half so me i realize that you want to pick the right strain you want to pick the wrong train because with the wrong strain it could definitely have you building this this bad conception of marijuana because it might get you too high you know it might not get you high because you know some some high levels of tac can can get someone really high but not to the feeling that they want to feel and higher cbd levels will probably make them feel even better with a lower thc level it depends or maybe some people might feel better with a higher thc level and a lower cbd level it all depends on your body you know so don't don't don't just smoke weed just to smoke weed and not try to do your homework on it or learn the the background of what happened with it and the science of it don't just do that make sure you always get the science of what you're smoking you you find out the name of it the strain how much level the chd has in it and they set you this is only going to help you on the longer it's not gonna it's not gonna hurt you it's far from hurting you i need something to do this one you have a sticker so now when you extract your your um your cbd oil you want to make sure you use a nice stick i don't have my own i don't have my my tool right now i left it in the house so i'm going to use a i took it at tobacco let's keep it real natural right now and you know me i'm a real i'm a naturalist so i don't lick my blunts i don't lick my blunts but if you have to you have to so what i like to do is i like to i like to just paste it right along crosstalk come come zoom in just paste it right along across right there boom bang just like that probably get a couple more scoops out a couple more scoops out and you don't have to use a lot i like to use a lot because i like to get hot but you don't have to use a lot bang right there all you do is gotta just tuck it down and flap one flap rest in piece of licking butts that's it and you got a whole blunt boom shout out to molly yeah if you do lick your blunts gargle so that's that's um pretty much it i don't want you guys to to make fun of my lighter i don't have the proper lighter with me today but we need to light this sucker and show you guys how i smoke oh sweet real sweet i definitely like the king louie better than the pineapple express but definitely doing the job give you that thick taste i always wanted to thick taste more smoke [ __ ] like citrus [ __ ] thanks a lot guys thanks for watching and that was the review of the cherry pie stay strong [Music]", "-x3UYdAmjos": "[Music] what's up everybody thanks for stopping by weeds reviews and checking out another one of my videos today some more products from a platinum vape new strands that come out that i was slacking on getting but i have gotten and i'm here to review for you guys today i'm gonna look at a sativa and an indica the sativa we'll be taking a look at is apple fritter and the endicott we'll be looking at is motor city kush motor city kush indica apple fritter sativa which one should we do first blindfold motor city cushion is one gram indica testing at 76.86 lab test 835. now this is indica so look for a relaxed kind of hungry euphoric thing out of this one at least that's what it says on the packaging again i will say everybody's body's different right elon some of it isn't healed some of us don't that being said screw this bad boy in let's get a taste of it that bubba um uh detroit was it bubba something about detroit bubba that i reviewed last time that was a really good cartridge from an indica strand um i'm hoping this lives up to what detroit bubble was motor city kush let's see boys girls yeah we have girls on this channel now hey how you guys doing for a while there's just us boys all right this cartridge is nice too cool this one has its own taste not really peppery like i was thinking we were going to see a lot of pepper from platinum vape now like it was going to be like their signature taste not the case this one here not peppery whatsoever real sweet decently real sweet diesel earthy taste no pepper whatsoever smooth nice tasting cartridge tell you what platinum knocking out of the out of the park at least with their indicas a couple of their hybrids nah i don't know yet like there was khalifa or that was cleveland khalifa kush with khalifa there was khalifa no they're uh khalifa kush it wasn't that great i was kind of let down with that one it was okay it was still like a three it wasn't like like hitting like a presto or uh you know like being like a a mittens extract it wasn't nothing that terrible but it was nothing great either like what you expect from planet vape like you expect kind of a quality cartridge quality cartridge sorry package quality cartridge every time from platinum vape because that's just what we're used to we're just using quality from planet vape when we're using instructions coming out kind of being shocked at how good they are because it seems like they're put way more and more into this they're coming out with new strands all the time now which that was something i had complained about with platinum how cool quality of the product was and how i would just wish more with strands would readily be coming out and that's something that they seem to be doing which other companies aren't you see mkx they're not keeping up with platinum vape platinum vape is blowing them out of the water right now because these new strands keep coming out all the time and they keep doing a good job with the ones that come out but every now and then out of the couple that they let out there's a few disappointments and that was one of mine so far motor city cush though definitely a five-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it up our sorry definitely four-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it a five yet because there's just so many of these other products that i still have to test i don't wanna make that make it so high that i have to keep giving out fives whenever you know there might be some fours and then one will be incredible to where it'll be at five but so far just a four nothing blowing your socks off but a really great cartridge again this was motor city cush indica one grand by platinum vape also i want to touch base on something you guys platinum vape's got a thing going on right now for the golden ticket when you buy a cartridge you get a golden ticket you win their little um sweepstakes that they got going on right now so they got a golden ticket sweepstakes going on right now we've opened three so far we haven't gotten it um i'm sure it's not gonna be too easy to get but it is a thing going on so when you open your cartridge look for your golden ticket willy wonka you want your golden ticket because that would be your golden chance to make your way because with the golden ticket it's a golden day you know come on people it's how it's gonna be so apple fritter sativa you guys all know you're on the channel you watch me if you can watch the channel i'm not a big sativa guy i test the sativas i do occasionally like to have steep around i have two up there so you know i open this one they're probably all going to fall nope i opened this about a month ago you can see i just really don't hit them that much i really don't his teeth that much um just because it's really not my thing and i'm more of an indica guy or a hybrid guy i'm really more of indica person myself if i'm going to buy a cartridge not just to review just a smoke i'm going to pick it in to come most of the time but this apple fritter was last tested 12 22 of 21 comes in at 70 76.6 we'll get off and take a look into it i had never known this around i actually went to a dispenser i never go to i've never really been to i think i've been to it maybe once in two years i went to it last weekend just stopping by coming back from my sister's place because it was actually close to there and it was a sunday and all the other ones were closing so i figured i'd stop by this one because it was on my way home it was close i could get there in the time allowed it and they happened to have this so i just grabbed it i seen it i was like um i've never seen it anywhere i'm gonna grab it so if you guys have seen this you already had it let me know in the comments what you think if you think the same thing if you haven't had it well we'll see what it's like together right away and outside of the cartridge is really sticky feels like maybe bad pour and maybe they clean it up as good as they should have but yeah the whole outside of this one's really sticky so this is the apple fritter sativa by platinum vape like like i said again 76.66 coming in lab tested 12 22. now this says it's supposed to have a real that's why you never go by what it says in the backbone i'm telling you you can't ever go by what it says this one says here it says earthy apple and sweet okay now i'm gonna tell you what it tastes like there's no earthy there's no apple there's no sweet it's a real chemically gassy off-tasting smell our taste and smell that comes off it not pleasant not whatsoever oh this cartridge is bad guys i mean i'm not putting on either i would give it a two and that might be pushing it i don't think i can even smoke this car the rest of this cartridge the reason being it's real chemically tasty it tastes like i'm smoking uh one of those trees for your car the air freshener trees that's what it tastes like i'm inhaling really bad cartridge i don't enjoy this at all elon even if he handled he wouldn't enjoy it yeah if you guys bought this dude if you agree with me let me know in the comments if you haven't bought it you probably want to think of it twice before doing so there's no apple to it there's no fritter to it there's nothing sweet there's nothing that tastes good about this cartridge and now like i said i'm not just putting on i'm not making it up if it was good i would say it was good i'm not just saying it because it's a tiva and i don't really like sativas because i there's a lot of stevia i did enjoy um this one here is just not there especially after tasting like trying like the new um detroit um kush and all those other ones and this it's just this just does fails in comparisons big time big time big time that's the apple fritter by planet vape i don't know if i would erect i can't recommend this car whatsoever i wouldn't say waste your money on this maybe if you're picking up four or four hundred you just want to try it or you haven't tried it you said [ __ ] it i don't care what this guy thinks i want to try anything for myself go ahead and do it but let me know in the comments what you think if you agree with me if i'm crazy but this cartridge here real chemically real are it just doesn't taste good at all it doesn't yeah i mean i can get a sense of what they're trying to do with the apple the other tastes there like this it just doesn't balance out well and it ends up tasting chemically yeah it doesn't balance out you can pick up the apple in there and what they're trying to do but it's just too artificial and it becomes chemically balanced tasting it doesn't it's bad it's not a great cartridge guys so that being said if you haven't subscribed guys i really appreciate you subscribing it would mean the world to me and if you haven't or if you have thank you

part right here boys raw garden yes sir one of my favorite cartridges of all time if not my favorite cartridge of all time and you guys know I've I think raw garden has to be one of the one of the brands that I've done several several videos on like I'm talking about probably for the first half of my youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it it's a little bit over a month so I don't know if you guys are even still aware that's going on but all you have to be doing is following my Instagram page which I'm gonna be playing down description below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "aiWVkxPev7A": "[Music] all right so I just got this thing to like hold my phone there's a [ __ ] Center people around

good somehow [ __ ] right now yeah I'm hopping bad", "PcRTkZwepdg": "yo what is going on guys Lauda steer they have been doing a quick little cart review and reviewing these glow cards today we got the gang Sinatra heard this glow extracts heard this is a new brand it seems pretty legit I mean I could definitely see how this is a filler or something though Mike yeah I'm sure this is a filler but uh this is like really good I guess knockoff oil but I mean in reality it's just this is just DISA lit you know it's just this lit as you guys can see you can see the bubble move but I was just in the car and I hit this at least like three or four times again it's moving really slow I know it looks like it's moving kind of fast because honestly I've had dank vapes before that move slows [ __ ] like way slower and that like doesn't even move type [ __ ] but honestly guys just because the bubble doesn't move like quick at all like I would be more sketch to that because you can add so many different things so that will just to boil and just make it stick or whatever see how I definitely be kind of skeptical of that I didn't cop a pack of these like like the 10 pack or whatever it's kind of similar to TKOs these are it's a seesaw with a white tip on it looks kind of like a fake supreme it's kind of what it reminded me of but not like the hit it's so Jupiter ring see so this is a clear ring it almost looks kind of white from the flash but I promise you guys it is clear so I know that these cards are mass-produced but do I know if they're coming from like a legit company out of California or something I don't know but I mean I'm basically just reviewing the court it so so let's go ahead and get straight into it me hitting it off see so palm and yeah that's why it's bubbly because I hit it like multiple times in the car before I made this video yeah so let's go ahead and pop it on okay and let's go ahead and hit this thing Cheers yes guys right off the bat this dank Sinatra it almost has like at the end of it I was like a berry taste to it the terpenes aren't overdid at all so it's gonna be a smooth consistent hit it's taste really good it's really good and my cats currently like beating on the [ __ ] door so that's why I kind of stopped talking consistently but uh yeah this it gets you high if you're someone that's like really used to basically fake car it's like if you're someone that's used to like terpene filled Danks or whatever then you might not like these just cuz of how smooth they hit you might feel like you're not getting high or whatever just cuz the smooth hit but I promise to you you know I was in the car and I had hit this right when I got it or whatever and I'd already hit cars from earlier but it was about like an hour and a half after I hit a cart previously and the [ __ ] crept up on me quick as [ __ ] guys like not even alive like I knew is some legit this way and I mean honestly if you look like caught on us I wish you could see it in real life I swear you can tell there's like we'll do a will in there guys yeah see the bubbles moving but it's still moving so slow like I've definitely had carts the bubble like just hasn't even moved type should like you couldn't leave it there come back 20 minutes and it's like not even moved half an inch but it really doesn't matter guys it you know it could easily added just a little bit more of something and it definitely could have made this bubble move a lot slower so that means that these are most likely just pure I definitely don't get that much Terps from this which is good but the tert Terps are there though so yeah guys just let me know if you guys want me review anything else thank these go cards damn cool once again thanks an ultra hybrid relaxation
