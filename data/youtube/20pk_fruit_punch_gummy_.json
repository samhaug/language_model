{"FZD3SldXppQ": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of that crazy weird confusing and sometimes a little anxiety inducing place called your dispensary and if yours is anything like mine sometimes it is a little overwhelming even for a guy who tries to keep up with all of the different weed products and companies and different consumption methods uh it seems like new things are being cooked up every day in that regard which is exciting to see but can be overwhelming as a consumer today though we're not going to talk about something overwhelming nothing new nothing novel one of the oldest forms of weed edibles that there are is something singular plural um and that that is the good old-fashioned weed gummy yes we are going to be reviewing some weed gummies and one from a favorite brand in our past one uh who is more known for their chocolate bars but now is branching out to the gummy world and that is punch punch edibles a lot of people really like the punch reviews in the past we reviewed these guys years ago they've been around since the um good old uh gray market um more uh only medical days making 200 and i believe 25 milligram chocolate bars uh and they've been around um they continued to exist throughout our new 100 milligram cap era where they curiously uh continued making chocolate bars but they only ever come in 90 varieties there's uh they don't go to the 100 they do 90. why i'm not sure um and it looks like their gummies follow suit as this is a their excuse me tangerine lemon a pink grapefruit citrus flavor all those are citrus fruits assumedly um and it is only 90 milligrams of thc probably shows up a little bit more clearly on those lab testing results in the back or 90.5 milligrams of thc not sure why they don't do the full 100 um but if it's anything like their chocolate bars they you know hit above their weight glass i apologize for the terrible pun i'm sure i've even made it before god damn me um but you know it's uh who knows it's got me talking about it right so this is a 90 milligram edible uh and like their chocolate bars uh they are a more affordable edible uh on the cheaper end i picked this up from my uh beloved dispensary in long beach for 12 buckaroonies and may or may not focus there but yeah not uh not bad for a 90 milligram edible usually trending a couple dollars down from the average so again but you get 10 less thc supposedly uh so without further yammering about this citrus punch fruit snack let's go ahead and open it up see what we got now we got a little dosing guide here uh it shows you what we need we've got 10 or excuse me nine 10 milligram squares because you can divide a square up that way for you geometry fans harder to divide a square into ten very easy to divide it into nine um that's for you arithmetic fans so uh it's got a fancy little plastic contraption very uh uh unnecessary in terms of packaging but you know i've seen more ostentatious but that's a hell of a lot of plastic for no real reason and then we got the extra plastic wrapping this that all says 90 milligrams 90 milligrams everywhere on it oh okay so it is three different flavors of gummies not one giant citrus catch-all smorgasbord kind of handsome looking very starbursty looking and very starburst colored i wonder if pink will be the best here as well let's go ahead and try one of each so i'm going to go and uh like all of our weeds reviews say this every time i review the whole uh product i'm going to review all 90 milligrams that are here i'm not going to necessarily do all 90 right now in front of you but i'll do them over the next hour or so and then two hours after i have that very last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly what we think of these very affordable punch edibles citrus flavored so this pink one is i'm gonna guess the tangerine no this orange one that i've got i'm gonna get my colors right that's tangerine hmm that is a gelatinous cube um quite a bit of weed taste um not as pristine uh a um gummy taste uh or a flavored gummy taste as like a plus or a steezy gummy it's not terrible but there is a definite weed aftertaste to these lemon yum and then for the star of the show the pink grapefruit i'm just going to pretend it's a pink starburst because my mind will make it taste better pink starburst [Music] tastes exactly like it wow okay yeah very strong very strong wheat taste um not overwhelming and you know uh they are more affordable and hopefully that means that they are just potent as af [ __ ] uh and for that we're just gonna have to wait and see i got six more of these guys to go as i said i'll do them over the next hour so how fun was that and once i'm done two hours after that see right back here until then stay high stay healthy i don't know why i tell you to do that you're just gonna see me in a couple seconds anyways i'll see you then [Music] hello guys i'm back it has been uh three ish hours maybe three and a half hours uh since my first piece of the cannabis infused punch fruit snacks um and i am very very happy to tell you nice and simply uh really like this stuff doesn't taste great but it does the trick um even with its 90 milligrams it still feels pretty strong to me um not a lot to have to get through just nine tiny little squares you're good to go or one if that's what your tolerance limit is um yeah and then of course the most impressive part of the entire package is gonna be that price uh usually you can get these substantially or you know somewhat cheaper than other edibles at the same or almost same dosage um and so if these are cheaper for you if these are a couple bucks cheaper than the next level up grab these these will do you um uh they're fruit snacks well i'm always gonna be a chocolate guy uh and i'm gonna always prefer punch bars chocolate bars the fruit snacks um holding their own for punch that's for sure um they're uh two for two on products as far as i'm concerned so that's a big old thumbs up from me uh and that means anytime we do those big old thumbs up we're gonna do a little cherry on top a little something extra that you know not necessarily weed related you can enjoy with or without weed it's up to you it's just a little cherry on top just a little something extra uh and this week uh i'm gonna make sure you guys keep those hbo max subscriptions um from lapsing you don't wanna cancel now you know you've only been a subscriber for however many months it's been around too i i feel like all these subscription services are sort of bundling together in my brain they're all launching at the same time it's all pretty wild anyways hbo max you got that one probably and if you do check out the righteous gemstones there's only one season it's another show from um i was gonna say wonderkind danny mcbride but that seems like um whatever the opposite of hellion kid whatever the opposite of wonder is is kind of danny mcbride um righteous gemstones is the uh story of a christian televangelist patriarch um played by jeff goodman and his three bumbling sons one of them played by danny mcbride who's also a show co-creator um and uh it tells the story of what a bunch of bumbling hypocritical [ __ ] the leaders of a massive um uh christian organization are and it's very funny and um judy one of the children of um jeff goodman the children of the patriarchy one of the main characters of the show the daughter uh one of the funniest performances i've seen in my entire life had me laughing constantly uh this cherry on top is for the righteous gemstones but there's an extra cherry on top of that cherry for i can't remember the actress's real name her name is judy gemstone in the show it's a great name judy gemstone try saying it yourself judy gemstone big thumbs up punch citrus tangerine lemon pink green food big thumbs up everything's coming up aces see you guys on the next review stay high stay healthy more important to stay healthy goodbye", "zSVTEKhG2d8": "hey guys welcome back to the show got a pre-workout for you guys today what we're doing from cellucor c4 gummies i'll put a better picture of that on the screen for you guys these are c4 gummies pre-workout fruit punch not the first time i've done gummies for pre-workouts on the channel but i enjoyed trying new things and i didn't even know they made these i happen to be wandering around the store or online came across this and said let's give it a shot it's different so serving size for this is five gummies and these are pretty decent sized gummies so there's 30 in here all together so it's only six servings now this cost me ten dollars so six servings comes out to a dollar and change plus per serving so we'll see how it is uh i think for traveling putting my bag it's great especially if you're gonna be somewhere where we might not have the water to make a pre-workout but um at the end of the day i'm not sure how practical having that gummy is on the road especially depending on the weather so let's go ahead and open this up got a seal here all right so this is what it looks like see if i can just you know that's what that's what it looks like about the circumference of maybe a quarter so five of these is the serving size and that's one that's two i'm sticking together a little bit three four and five it's got like sours all over it so that's the serving size right there we're gonna go ahead try this and uh see how it is oh oh [Music] and that's only one that's i'm a huge cellucor fan but oh that's bad all right that tasted terrible just horrible and i got like the sour which might even be the cause of the issue those sour things like on the side of sour kings all over my desk but um i want to i'm going to drink something after this but once again as always everybody is different well i like you might not like and vice versa but we're gonna go ahead and try these out cause the important thing isn't always how good it tastes but it's how good it is in the gym so we're gonna go ahead do our workout come back stay tuned part two coming up hey guys welcome back this is part two of cellucor c4 pre-workout gummies and if you recall it's still got the mess in front of me it's messy it's sticky it tastes terrible i did not care for the taste it just made a mess that being said on to the workout it sucked i i didn't feel this at all felt nothing from this just the horrible taste was stuck in my mouth the entire time didn't matter the water i drank but tastes bad bad performance i do not recommend this at all so that's all i can really say on it it's probably all the gummy things i've tried yeah it's not near the top so once again c4 cellucor pre-workout gummies fruit punch flavored not a buy for me but once again what you might like and was different than what i might like but that's all i got to say on this like follow subscribe see you guys on the next one the healthy nerd", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "Xe56pfvVAB0": "welcome back to traces please today we are gonna make it a homemade gummy bears we have a ball where we need to make sense we have sugar apple etheric luck to be precise precise with mine but my gummy bears yeah we're punch you get picks the juice of your choice we have this disco dust to add decorations to our bears and we have gelatin so let's start to make your own bear you need to make sure you it's all the reason I'm not going safe Bowl so I'm gonna start off my sugar I did a 1/3 of a cup [Music] okay three tables Angelica's Westfield just a sugar or 1/2 work assignment we tried to

[Music] you once all your going home you need to put in the fridge for at least 1 hour soft seat back and our guys this way a little bit more hour and these are about ready so I'll pop them out the first one it's just like jello plate sticky I took out every single gummy bears and each mold harder than about 50 gummy bears so I picked out 100 what's a way too long but so I'm gonna try one they're very jiggly I'm not scared I'm agile over here okay thanks for watching an episode of tracing these trees I'm here that hole make sure to talk to yourself it's the most you can buy guys", "cQpKh8wBKTA": "hey what's going on YouTube just wanted to shoot a video today I'm having a party this weekend and I wanted to prepare a special treat for everyone so today I will be making drunken gummy bears or some people call them rummy bears despite whatever alcohol you use today I am going to be using just your standard package of gummy bears each of these is 368 grams from my local Publix I recommend we're gonna do about four bags and that should be plenty for up to 15 to 20 people so should be fine next off we're going to need to get our bears drunk so I've picked up a pinnacle tropical punch vodka you can use pretty much any flavor or unflavored that you like whatever brand you prefer I thought with the tropical fruit you know gummy bears why not try a little tropical fruit pinnacle vodka so we'll give that a shot this is a 1.75 liter and it's probably going to be more than what I need here because really we just need to cover the gummy bears uh right above the top so you will also need some sort of vessels for the gummy bears to sleep in for a while while they get a fat and juicy so I just got a this is like a little cereal saver Tupperware and that's pretty much all we need so far none of that stuff there that's another video anywho let me see if I got a pair of scissors in here let's get the gummies out and get them prepared trying to do this one-handed guys still bear with me no pun intended all right got our first delicious set of gummy bears as you can see they are just your standard size this recipe also works for any type of gummy fruits gummy worms gummy fish gummy anything you could think of so I chose to do bears because uh when they plump up they actually get about six or seven times their normal size and it makes for a pretty cool party of party favor so we'll have the first bag here dump them all in yep I may not even use all four it looks like my vessel might not hold it all they're three and you definitely want to leave some room because these guys are going to grow I think I'm okay here because even if they do like I said grow about four times their size they should still squish together and and hopefully not explode out of here but you're going to let them sit for several days so if you notice your levels start rising and they get out of control you may need to move them to another vessel so in this container I did three bags at 13 ounces each so those 39 ounces of gummy bears next up I'm going to hit with the pinnacle tropical punch vodka let's crack that open mmm delicious might have to have a little yeah good stuff pretty good taste too all right so we're going to top the gummies off put them in their drunken coma if you look real close there they're just ready to be saturated and this recipe is great your friends will love it good for the type of people who don't like strong drinks you know you just pop a few gummies and it's like taking a few shots once they plump up they really soak you know about a half a shot worth of vodka so we're getting close here we just want to barely cover them and this will be fully absorbed after several days so if you take a look at my bottle here looks like we ran through about a half of a 1.75 liter bottle alright so after we've covered our gummy bears up with our vodka you pretty much just want to put them in your fridge rater and stir them at least once a day whether I mean if you've got a good seal on it you can probably do a shake or a tip or whatever if you're doing it in like a bucket or something just get a spoon stir it up you know once or twice a day and the longer they sit the more they'll soak up so you'll start seeing this liquid level come down and you just want to keep making sure your cycling them so go ahead and throw them in your fridge for about three or four days and when they're ready pop them out and have a good time with all your friends", "1EtbenDg0YM": "Oh again everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be sharing my super simple gummi recipe but first if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will be in the description below also and I really hope you enjoyed this recipe but until next time take care and I will see you in another video", "h1l6cL2yspg":

fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "lkTLGySENVU": "Hi Bold Bakers! Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "qMOFwO6hWgQ": "hey guys it's Lisa from the blog farmhouse on Boone comm and today my

is so gloomy outside right now I just want to make some hot chocolate and cuddle up under a blanket on the couch and watch TV but yesterday when it was all so gloomy I spent my day in the kitchen making some DIY fruit snacks some of you might call them gummy some of you might call them Fruit Chews but no matter what you call them these actually are really yummy and they're really easy to make too I picked up some unflavored gelatin from my local Target you can find this from many grocery stores and for those of you who live the vegan lifestyle I found a website that might help you out with some unflavored gelatin that will work for your diet so if you go to a website called vegan essentials comm I've never shopped on this before but I just wanted to do a little research for you guys there's a product called Lieber's unflavored jello you use in place of the unflavored gelatin if you don't want to use this product the other things you'll need are 100% fruit juice and any type of silicone mold if you don't have a mold you can always just use a dish and pour it in kind of like jello and cut it into little squares or use a cookie cutter which I'll show you in this video before we get into the video a little bit about what's coming up on Friday I got this yarn I'm planning on making a loom knit yarn hat if you don't have a yarn loom you could probably just use a container and like I showed you in the yarn flower you could make your own loom somehow this one's out of thin yarn so this one with the thicker yarn will look much better and be a lot more cozy but this was just a test so if you like this idea let me know and I haven't tied it off yet if you're interested in seeing Friday's video and all of my upcoming Christmasy and holiday videos then please subscribe to my channel and click the thumbs up button and now let's get into making some yummy fruit snacks yummy gum you see for this recipe I'm going to be using some unflavored gelatin some 100% fruit juice any flavor that you want and a silicone mold I purchased my adorable mold from amazon.com I'll give you the link to that in the description box below also honey is optional for more sweetness and you'll want to use during spoons imagine cup a pot to mix in I'm beginning by getting a measuring cup and I'm just going to pour one cup of juice into that now pour your juice into the pot and you're going to measure two tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're using the exact same gelatin the I am you'll just use three of the packets let the powder completely absorb into the juice and then mix it together once it's nicely mixed you're going to turn on the flame to a low to medium heat and then you're going to just heat that up until you can't see any more powder it will just be really liquidy and at this point you can use some honey for more flavor you can use any type of essential oil such as vanilla or mint any type of flavoring that you want to and just add that into the pot now I'm using a syringe that I got from the pharmacy at Target they just gave it to me so if you go up and ask if they sell them they might just give you one I washed this with soap and hot water and then I am just filling it up with the mixture this just makes it a lot easier to fill up your little tiny silicone molds then if you have any mixture left over which I do you can just pour it into a plate with a groove or you can use any type of Bowl or glass pan to pour this into then you're going to put all your gelatin into the refrigerator and let it chill for maybe an hour it might not take that long but just to be safe and then once it's completely hardened you'll remove it of course and here I'm showing you that you can make little hearts or whatever shape you want by using cookie cutters and you can of course eat all the excess that is left over then the ones in the mold of course you'll just pop out carefully at all the cute little shapes will be revealed for my next batch I cut the recipe so I only used 1/3 of the ingredients and I'm actually using food coloring to color the apple juice since it's a really light color so instead of using 1 cup of juice I used 1/3 cup and that is enough to fill up this mold and still have some left over and then you just use one packet of the gelatin if you're using the box I am and any amount of other flavoring that you want and there you have it personalized gummies you can make any shape that you want and you can make any flavor essentially - so these are really cute and really fun snacks to have around I love eating gummies I think they're so yummy so this is a perfect way to make your home I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you did please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my soap craptastic channel and stay tuned for

you how to make it keep this is a hat Thai stick tight stay salt if you baby it's cold outside", "DGbITXSfySg": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz and this is the first time you're stopping by and the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much for joining so today I am going to show you how to make real fruit gummies yes made with real fruit so you can use frozen or real arms not frozen fresh fruit that would be the word fresh or frozen I prefer the frozen however like I said you can use either and you can make these yummy yummy cannabutter and fruit snacks now your kids would love these too - the can of butter obviously but if you want to make a really nice candy for your kids just follow the recipe along it just exclude the can of butter and the guar gum and you've got a great relatively someone okay you're sticking fruit in it so we can call it somewhat healthy candy for your kids alright guys so let's jump right into those ingredients what we need to get started and yeah we'll get these made oh one thing I want to tell you if you are because we're using real fruit you do need to use a mold inhibitor lorraine's makes one so it's called Lorraine's mold inhibitor I however do not have it if you do not use a mold inhibitor you will need to keep these in the refrigerator you won't be able to keep them out for like two three weeks on the counter because they will get moldy if you do use the mold inhibitor however you will but I do not have it so I'm not using it but I just wanted to let you know that piece of information so with mold inhibitor you can keep them out and we'll have a lot much longer shelf life without it you're gonna want to keep them refrigerated and get the meat and fairly quickly alright so for our gummy fruit snacks what we're gonna need is about two cups of fruit so I use frozen fruit I just find it's way easier you so you can use any favorite any favorite fruit that's you like I'm using a mixed berry combo so it's blueberry strawberry and blackberries the only fruit that you cannot use is pineapple and I think also mango because it has they contain an enzyme that will not allow gelatin to set but other than that you're free to go so it's said you can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit and I said you can buy one about 2 cups we're only going to use about a cup the extra you can always freeze and save for later then a for our candy syrup you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water now if you have a can of syrup or can of sugar you can absolutely use those as well so again you want to split part of it so quarter cup quarter cup however you want to split that up you could absolutely use those but today I'm just demonstrating with cannabutter now for the rest of it what you're going to need is a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/4 cup of sugar granulated sugar another quarter cup of granulated sugar that we need to premix our clear gel with you're going to need instant clear gel now you don't have to use this if you don't have this you can eliminate it but what this adds to is makes that candy a little softer instead of being so gelatin like it makes it that softer that real candy texture loves of fruit snacks so this is an optional if you've got it if not you don't need to if you do not need you are not using the clear gel eliminate 1/4 cup of the sugar you're going to need three quarters of a cup of ice cold water or blooming your gelatin you're going to need three core three tables sorry three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin so it was three and a half tablespoons on a flavored gelatin and a half a teaspoon of citric acid 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum now this is our emulsifier this is what's going to allow us to combine our butter with our water because that's a water oil mixture and you need an emulsifier in order to combine those two to become one so that they become friends instead of mortal enemies and that is it I believe so for this we don't need any extra color or flavor and that's what's really nice and now another side note for those of you who do not like corn syrup you can make a substitute called inverted sugar which is 2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water boil it to 234 degrees as soon as it hits that temperature removed from the heat put the lid on the pot do not touch it again until it hits room temperature once you're at room temperature it's stable good to go if you want more details about how to do that check out my canna syrup video its basis in its making inverted sugar but with candy syrup just avoid via the can of sugar part that's all ok so that's all we need for our ingredients let's jump into our equipment that we need and we'll get going all right so for the equipment we are going to need two small sauce pans a whisk spatula the hand blender this is for emulsifying if you don't have one you can use the whisk it'll work you just have to want with really really hard but these are definitely an investment if you are going to be regularly making Jam and things like that you're going to need a candy thermometer now check this said I got this off Amazon it's a dual so let's pop the probe it's got that probe and then it's got a probe that you stick in the side which is awesome so I can just slide it in my pot and keep it on the side oh it's great remember the issues I always had before problem solved and you're going to need your distributing bottles these are a sweet sugar or bell I believe yes we took about I got links for all these equipment if you want just to make life easy you can check out what it is in the description there and then just a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or washing down the side of our pot that's pretty much what we need I'm sure I'm gonna throw some extras in there Oh obviously your bowls now a trick that I've learned with my molds is because this is gonna be a loser syrup and I'm gonna do two colors as always put your molds into the freezer that way wouldn't you put as soon as you squeeze it in it kind of immediately starts to solidify that way your colors don't bleed all together so it's a really cool little trick for you all right so let's get all those ingredients put together and let's make some fruit snacks so the first thing we want to do is get our gelatin bloomed and we'll be set aside and waiting for us so we're gonna add our three-quarters of a cup of ice-cold water and three and a half tablespoons of our unflavored gelatin and you just want to sprinkle it kind of evenly over the top or it'll be four envelopes of the gelatin approximately and then you wanted this to mix that in until it is well mixed and there's no lot and then while you're mixing this well how you can kind of tell that your gelatin designs your gelatin may not be thickening as well is while you're mixing it it should start to feel like applesauce the texture of applesauce now I'm feeling this is a little bit thin it's all dissolved and it's still not quite as thick as I'd like it so I'm gonna add about another half a tablespoon to that that's better so that when you mix it up and it's all dissolved that's the texture you want it to be so like a like an applesauce and then I'm just gonna set that aside we'll let that bloom and you need at least a minimum five minutes but it's okay it can wait longer okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare our berries or our fruit whatever fruit that you're using so we are going to put our heat on to medium high okay so the first step is our berries now what you're going to need to do is to prepare your berries ahead of time and we eat you're going to be to macerate them then what that means is I'll whether you're using frozen or fresh put them into a bowl instead about two cups you're gonna add a quarter cup of lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar mix that all around cover it with saran wrap and put it into the fridge for a minimum of two hours if you are using frozen fruits if they're going to be about four hours or you could just leave it on the counter that's no problem and you want one you get will create this really nice syrup and everything will be defrosted dissolve whatever defrosted not frozen anymore do that ahead of time so the first thing I want to do because I've got a lot of seeds and extra stuff I'm just going to strain off the extra juice and those seeds now what you can actually use that juice for don't waste it is if you're a baker you can make a simple syrup with it so add about half a cup of water a cup of sugar boil it for two or three minutes and and that's it letter B and you've got a simple syrup that you can then use on your cakes to cope your cakes with you know those Decorah the american bakers and all that stuff hot they're always putting those things on youtube can do the thing so I'm just getting a little off that excess juice here well obvious I'm not going to get the seeds that I'll get those out after when we when we mush it down when we purify it so I'm going to add a quarter cup of sugar to that get my spatula and we're going to turn our heat on to medium high and you're just gonna mix that around we're just going to bring this to a boil for about two minutes my berries are coming to a boil here don't have better angles so you're just gonna continue mixing that like I said we're just gonna boil that for about two minutes and then we want to get our hand blender ready all right so my little berries and then boiling here for a couple of minutes this is just a soft in the month so that we can purify them puree them not purify puree them a lot easier and if you're using fresh fruit you may need to go for about five minutes and you're going to get your hand blender be very careful cuz it's gonna be hot and be careful if anything splashes up so we are going to puree okay so you're going to continue to blend that until it is completely purified all your fruit is completely blended and there's no major chunks and I'm just going to strain our puree to catch all the seeds and any fruit chunks that did not that did not get liquefied pureed [Music] and then you're just gonna work your puree through your strainer takes a little while just scrape off the bottom a little bit of a pain but you inside necessary to catch like I said if you're definitely using berries or fruits with seeds and also to make sure like I said any fruit that doesn't get purified if you don't want any chunks in your candies so just continue that until you can't get anything nothing else is uh working its way through the mesh and you're just gonna have kind of a puppy puppy mutt mush left okay then once you've got all that we want to measure out about it we're going to measure a cup of our fruit puree a lot worked out pretty even all right okay so now clean this off quickly it's a rinse off your blender because you're going to need it again and we are going to take our pure heart root puree put her back in the pot and we are going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acids help key things to help bring out the fruit flavors the tartness and the fruit flavors as well as it helps prevent crystallization just mix that in and now we are going to you're going to premix up here our clear gel so we're taking a quarter cup of granulated sugar and we're going to take one tablespoon our cereal and it needs to be the instant clear gel the cook you have to cook it for five minutes boil it at a vigorous boil for five minutes and we can't really do that with our fruit so you wouldn't want to use the instant if you are using it they're gonna cut together we're gonna set that we'll just leave that there for a moment so now we are going to add our can of butter to our puree work fruit puree say that ten times quick so first drop in your melted can of butter let make sure to get a roll and sprinkle in a half a teaspoon of gorgeo and you want to try and get that kind of mixed all around not mix like sprinkled even kind of evenly around like so can't really see there that doesn't help sorry and I'm gonna actually angle the camera because I want you to see the emulsification okay so we're just gonna kind of just stir that in a little bit to begin with make sure it's not stuck to the sides and we are going to get our a hand blender [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now this can happen sometimes because I let that gourd sit for a minute or two while I was setting stuff up it started it started to clump if that does that you end up with any lumps in your mixture don't worry about it just run it through a strainer and it will catch those lumps and you're always good [Music] which I am going to have to do here so watch doesn't always happen if you actually mix your gore and your guar gum into a little bit of your butter first it will melt and you won't ever have that issue I kind of forgot that step okay now if you're using the clear gel you need to do this last step if you're not using clear gel just set your puree aside and we'll be moving on to our candy syrup so you're gonna put your pureed back into the pot on medium low heat after you can turn it up to medium we just need to get it keep it up and get it started boiling now this see what an emulsifier does you can see that there's no oil separation between your water and your and your oils the sudden it makes them friends and yes you can use soy or sunflower lecithin you could use about a teaspoon of that I'm just gonna get my wrist candy and once our mixture comes to a boil turn off your heat take it off the heat and we are going to whisk in our sugar and clear gel mixture so I just do a little bit at first get that way now let's get the rest of it in so that what this creates is a softer texture to your candy versus that being more of a gelatin okay so we are going to let this we're going to set this off to the side and now we're going to cook up our candy syrup all right so to our pot we are going to add our half a cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup and our 1/4 cup of water you can just stir that together and turn your heat on to medium high but you're going to stir this until it comes to a boil once it starts to come once it comes to a boil we'll have our candy thermometer and cook it to 275 degrees and this one you're gonna want your cup of hot water and that pastry brush to clean down the sides of your pot Thanks so my search beginning to boil so at this point I'm going to stop stirring and we are going to cook this to 275 degrees now for those who will cook syrup for the first time yours your temperature will come up to around the two 2223 mark and it's gonna sit there for a few minutes this is when a large when your large majority of your water is starting to boil off so it is not uncommon for it to sit at that temperature for a while then once it does start passing that the temperature will start to increase fairly quickly so I've had a few people comment saying but it doesn't get higher than 220 you just got to be patient it will and again just wash down any sugar crystals that are from a farm on the side all right so we're getting there or almost a temperature all right so candies of temp I'm gonna move it put it on the stone here that will help take away the heat quickly so I'm just waiting for the bubbling to stop now we're gonna add in our few fruit puree okay so our bubbling is stopped or it's starting to subside there it's going to a syrup now when you do add to puree it is gonna bubble up again don't worry about that he may bubble up again and we are going to mix this stir it until everything is completely mixed together we're gonna stir this for a couple of minutes until our fruit and our syrup and everything gets combined and that extra sugar gets melted yeah if you find that the syrup is starting to solidify on the bottom no problem just put your heat on to low and we'll get that get that melted and you just want to eat it up and Toba candy from the candy syrup is melted and become syrup again we don't want to start it boiling and I'm gonna use the hand blender on that so that we can get every leave emulsified because we do have the oil you've just dyed it in some more water to that we're gonna use the hand butter to get that all also 5 now have a look if you see you can see it butter any butter rising at the top so you'll see like a little bit of an oil slick I'm gonna add in a little bit more gore gum to get that most of Isis what will happen is that will rise to the top of your candies and you won't have a nice mixture okay so what I'm going to do this time is I'm adding a little bit of oil and I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon of the Gorgo to it just mix it together I see how it dissolved this will avoid any lumping and now we're just gonna add that on to into our candy we get our handy-dandy blender now our last step is we are going to add in our gelatin so we've got our bloomed gelatin this will be warm enough for it to melt we don't want to have it on heat because gelatin will break very easily if it is too high it melts at a warm water bath temperature she's gonna break that up into smaller chunks and you're just gonna can stir that until it is all melted I'm just gonna give it one final mix here with our hand next blender and there we go now I'm just gonna let this sit for a little bit so that we can go so the air bubble isn't that can work out and we can have a clearer syrup mixture so instead of having it like this it'll become clearer so we're just gonna let it sit probably about 15-20 minutes or so and if it does stiffen up too much you can just turn it on low heat to remelt it and then bring the right on one nuke them then when the air bubbles rise up to the top settle at the top here you can just use a little small strainer just as scoop them off or you can also stir gently kind of break them but they're a little hard then as it cools if you help remove some more of those air bubbles is just going circular motion gentle circular motion and see how it'll pull with bubbles kind of all together in the middle then you can just take your scoop and just skim it off the top yeah I'm gonna get my bottles fill up my large one and I use a strainer to help to catch anything else or any extra seeds that mean snuck through or if it's gum if it's become a little too solidified you can just put it up back on the heat low heat or just a couple of minutes just to warm it up a little bit now half of this I'm gonna do is the translucent and the other half I'm gonna add a couple of drops of white to give create a solid background but with the same kind of color so it looks really cool gives you a nice contrast I'm just gonna give this a real quick heat up here so I just heated it up just a little bit you don't want to go heat it too much because you'll break the gelatin so just enough to make it a little bit more syrupy I live my technical terms so I'm just gonna add a couple of drops of the white food coloring mix that in and so see how I create that solid background alright so I just took my molds out of the freezer nice and cold chilled and I'm gonna get my two colors my solid and my clear and just pour yeahjust both together and you can kind of do any design you want what let me get that in a minute or just go half in half or a little marble effect and that's it just fill up your cavities and then you're gonna pop these into the fridge for about two hours and then we'll come back and take them out you can see what they look like alright so it's time to pop these puppies out let's have a look-see there we go nice and easy they pop out now these guys do not get sugar or sour coated these are just the plane the plane kind their regular fruit snacks with a little kick alright it's gonna get the rest of these guys out here you go haven't got clothes so check that out yeah I got the two-tone solid with the translucent they look pretty cool eh let's check out a dinosaur there we go whoa check that one out whoo-hoo all right so I'm just gonna pop the rest of these guys out and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this no sorry so what you're gonna do is if you have used the mold and immature you can let these dry out on the counter for a couple of days if you have not used the mold inhibitor you're going to put them into the fridge for about 24 24 or 48 hours to dry in the fridge then take them out for 24 hours but for the pretty much you'll want to keep them in the fridge in a sealed airtight airtight container I would not keep these out exposed if you haven't used the inhibitor for more than three or four days yeah because you don't want anybody getting sick and because you're using the real fruit and if they will likely get mold on them very quickly all right so that's everything if you have any questions at all or any comments that you'd like to leave please don't hesitate and thank you guys so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Boer0JsjnVs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to me too staff and today we're going to do a design with the watermelon um we did this before but we're doing a second um part of the watermelon which is going to be a different style so as you can see here we're rinsing the [Music] watermelon and now we have the watermelon um on um the table um and we are showing you guys how the watermelon is now we're cutting the watermelon from the middle well it's not all the way in the middle but it's like kind of in the top because we're taking out the top now you guys can see the watermelon how we cut it it's kind of not even but we um are going to see we're going to cut the top off of the um um the top of the watermelon so we're going to we're going to cut we're going to cut some of it out you know i'm going to make little pieces and stuff and we're going to make like a little hood and stuff based on the thumbnail guys okay [Music] now we got some cherries we got some very cherry we got wood doll we can create stuff with that so that's for like arts and crafts we got pure honey um so these are the ingredients we'll be using for today's uh um little snack so we um are cutting the all the little watermelon all the watermelon and leaving the skin um the watermelon so just cut all the watermelon inside of it and leave the skin and as you can see here we are cutting some of the white parts of the skin it depends how you like this if you want to cut some of the white part you can if you want to skip that part you can just skip to the vid you can skip the video you can skip to the part you want to do all right now we're going to do the design [Music] our design might be different than yours but we're showing you our design what we love to do and yeah you guys can do anything you want any design but this is just an idea of what we do and showing you to entertain you guys so i hope you guys enjoy so our design is kind of triangular it's like it's kind of like a triangle so like it's like some small triangles and there's some big triangles so that's how it's going to be so we're just cutting it like that [Music] i know cutting um triangles out of stuff might be kind of hard it depends what angle are you using and what type of knife are you using because if you're not using a sharp knife and your and your object that you're cutting um on is really hard and you you're using a soft knife like a a butter knife or table knife that that is not going to work on this little project that we're doing today so just use a knife that's really really really credible that can cut anything it's really sharp and now we're putting it under the watermelon it's like a little platform for the watermelon to stay on but we're all gonna we are gonna be putting another thing to hold the watermelon up while we are cutting the inside of the watermelon [Music] okay as you guys can see we're cutting some of the excess out of the watermelon some of the stuff we don't need i call it samples because um when you record you kind of eat some of the watermelon that's off of it so i call it a sample for me um i started eating some off camera but yeah um now we're going to take um this flat sharp thing that was really sharp in the edge so like it's for pizza if you want to pick up your pizza correctly gonna pick it up without any messes you can use that tool and it'll be helpful but right now we're not using that for pizza we're using that to cut inside our watermelon and making our whole [Music] all right now we're using the knife to mix make to like pick it up a little bit we're trying to like um like you know it's all sticked up with the watermelon so we're trying to make it come out we need this the inside of the watermelon to come out but we're not going to take out all the inside we're just going to take out how much we want you guys to take out the whole thing if you guys want but we're going to put stuff inside that's why we are taking some of the inside of the watermelon but not all because we are still going to eat this watermelon after we drink everything that's inside and eat everything this inside so this is just another design if you guys do not like it you guys don't have to make it but we just all we're just doing is we're trying to entertain you guys and i hope you guys enjoy that's all we are doing and that's what we want you guys to do you guys will need to like we're not forcing you guys to do this but we just wanted we just want you guys to learn how we do it or to see how what we do on youtube so yes this is what we do with a watermelon not always though but we're showing you a design but we could design it how we design our watermelon so all right you guys can already see inside the watermelon um i think we're going to scroll inside this the watermelon um so you guys can see the whole watermelon how it looks inside it's really cool inside what if i live there what if you live there imagine guys see i told you guys i was going to scroll inside just so you guys can see those are stuff like inside of it but we're trying to take some out and leave like you guys don't need to take out the juices inside of it or you guys don't have to take out all the watermelon pieces you have to leave it in and just add some odd this stuff that we're using today so you guys don't have to like worry about the juice you guys don't have to worry about that if you're doing the same thing as us if you're doing the same process you guys will not have to worry about the juice or the seeds if you guys do not like seeds okay um you guys can try to take it out before you even do the cutting part so when you do the cutting part you're going to take out the seeds and take out the water because the water holds the seeds more than the watermelon does so you guys want to do that instead so then um we are still taking out some of the watermelons of the watermen pieces that's inside the watermelon that should not be there so um we do not like those pieces but we can keep some of it that we can't even take out so we're taking out those the watermelon pieces that we can take out some of them we cannot but we are going to leave the stuff that we cannot see you guys can see the water is still in there and some of the pieces that we cannot take out is still in that watermelon so that's how it is you guys that's why i said if you guys do not like seeds you guys can already take out all the little pieces and all the stuff that you guys do not like in the watermelon or if you're not doing it we're just here for entertainment [Music] all right everyone we are starting to put the cherries and if you saw if you saw us take the cherry um it's like we have two cherries we have cherry fruits and we have like all the cherries like different colors and we have one cherry that's red like the regular cherry but the stem is not there so as you can see here we are going to be blending the watermelon and you can see the cherry fruits like all the fruits in it you guys if you go to school and you guys see fruits and it looks like that that's what they put in a little cup for you guys to eat at school if you are a student um now we are blending um the watermelon in the natural boulette and you guys can see it looks it was like the full cup now it's like a smoker of course um now we're going to pour that juice the watermelon juice inside that's why i said you guys can keep you guys can keep the little juices the watermelon juices because we are going to pour the watermelon juices inside of it still so you guys don't have to like do that you have to have to work that hard this video is not to work that hard this video is just to give you guys a little console or give you guys a little entertainment so you guys can enjoy and at least watch something on youtube because if we're still doing curry we're still in quarantine okay now we're pouring honey if you guys do not know we are pouring honey in a big spoon well it's like a spoon for soup if you're like going to pour soup so now that's the honey that's how much honey you need well you can you could put how much honey it's um matters about how much you like it or if you have like um diabetes do not put that much because it has of sugar in it so do not um if you guys know that you guys have that do not put that much and you can only put how much you desire and you should always taste it taste how it tastes all the time so you guys can know that if it's your flavor if you like it that much all right now we're gonna pour the little cherry fruits in there this is really cool it looks really really really juicy and i really want to taste it so i cannot wait after this video [Music] all right so now we're cutting the pieces of the watermelons that we cut from the inside um of course we're going to cut it and we're going to make a design with the sticks because you guys are like why are you guys why you need the sticks why you need the sticks for when you need the creative sticks well we're going to be using those sticks for a reason and you guys are going to you guys gonna see that once you're done with the cutting part so you guys can cut it how many you want how much you want it or you guys can cut it whatever you like what shape you guys can cut it any shape you guys like it's your desire not my desire remember it's your watermelon you brought it from the store so it's your watermelon it's your piece it's your design okay so we're doing the same thing to the to all of the watermelon if you guys are really creative you guys can do different designs to all of the watermelon pieces you have to do square triangle octagon any shape in your desire but if you're really creative i will know that a person will do that will make different shapes okay so we are now putting some vanilla extract i'm putting a tablespoon in there um vanilla extract like i said um if you guys do not like vanilla extract well it gives a little it gives it a little taste like a little flavor so that it could taste really tasty so that's why you're putting vanilla extract and now of course we're going to put the watermelon pieces inside you know we want we want people to taste the watermelon because you know there's stuff inside the watermelon so how you're going to eat the watermelon so that's why we're putting some watermelon pieces if you guys do not like watermelon pieces inside that you guys might think it's disgusting or anything well you guys do not have to do that because it's not your desire if you guys don't like that you guys don't have to but we're putting that in there um yes you guys do not have to add stuff in there if you guys don't want so that's on you if you want to add stuff in there if you just don't want to add anything in there you just want to add the ju the blended watermelon you can we're going to add a little bit well we're going to add more um the same size of honey inside because it did not taste that sweet we want it to say sweet and we're going to um we got lemon we got a lemon and nigga's like oh my gosh what do you guys want lemon for well we're not going to use the lemon um we're not going to use the lemon inside the the thing the little fruits inside because it might taste too bad it might somebody might crunch the lemon just the skin the lemon on accident and we would not like that because they would taste nasty so as you can see here we're going to take the juice of it not the skin we're not going to put the whole thing in there kevin i got to cut it in little pieces yeah no we're just going to do that with that we're just going to squeeze it if you guys don't want to have that you guys can squeeze it with your hands um and we're going to like put the little juices the juices of the um lemon in there we're only going to use one lemon if you guys did not know we use only one lemon no more lemons only one we don't want the we don't want the little fruits in there to taste too sour okay um we're making holes so that the water of the watermelon could like go inside there because it's kind of getting full and falls full so we might not even add any more stuff inside because it might become too full because we have to add a tent it might look like a tent guys it might all right guys so um we are adding the sticks now you're not adding the [Music] sticks [Music] all right so we are going to put the top on um oh yes and we um cut at the top because we wanted to make a little tint you know a little tent for our little watermelon fruits inside and the fruits and the cherry fruits everything in there we are adding um the same pieces of watermelon that we did not add inside um on the top but if you guys don't have those kind of sticks you guys can use like chop you guys can use the same sticks that we using with to hold the tent up or you guys can use the same thing that we're using to put the watermelon in um we also have them toothpicks yes you guys can also use that we have the lemon we have only we have like a triangle lemon of course we're going to put that on the side next to the watermelon or on top because it matters about you guys and see your desire what you guys want you guys can do anything that you guys want by just showing you a design [Music] that we love to do all right there we go the one piece um we also gonna get another toothpick and do the same thing with another lemon so if you guys you guys can do any shape of lemon that you guys want any shape you guys can do square lemon but we did triangle square any shape it depends how big your lemon is okay you guys i know i know you guys are like when are we going to add the red cherries well we are going to be adding the red cherries last because we're going to put them in a big toothpick and it's going to be like oh it's like it's going to be big and long adding another lemon [Music] here we go [Music] all right now we're adding the cherries in this is almost our final part guys the cherries are going to be in all right so we're adding the cherries um i'm sorry if you guys cannot see but we're adding the cherries like that we're gonna add like that like we're gonna make it long if you guys don't like if you guys don't have students or kids that go to school and they're always taking their straws and they're putting their fruits on the straws and then you're like eating it like that yeah that's how we're doing it just if you have children ask them if they do it um now okay we switched sticks if you guys saw we sticks we switch sticks and we put melon instead of lemon get it watermelon melon instead of lemon okay so now we're adding um the cherries on the sides [Music] since the tent of um the top of the melon it's circle so we're making everything in a circle you know it looks really pretty it looks really pretty i love this little design i hope you guys love this too and also comment down below what what watermelon design should we do next or visit our instagram page and if you guys are doing the same design you guys if you guys doing the same design as us make a picture and they um send the picture to us um on our instagram page at me too star and now we are just adding our straw as you can see here we add green grapes on the bottom to get a little color to the watermelon of course and on the top of the little watermelon on top of the little cherry watermelon pattern we put a lemon on top which is looking really pretty because we want we instead of giving the red little the red little colors to it we keep a little yellow because we need a yellow and we need a green right of course um there's already green under watermelon so green is already a color to that it's giving color the watermelon is already giving color to it everything is even kind of a pink straw everything you guys could also drink it and then you guys can take all the juice that's inside of it and then leave it all right now we are taking a short video for you guys now and showing you how it looks um in a three 360 turn so up high that's how it looks up high so this is um how the watermelon looks i hope you guys enjoy this video and subscribe like and share [Music] bye", "SwShBN4kTqg": "[Music] hello welcome back to operating sec this is a special video collaboration with Julie from a beautiful horizons we will be releasing videos for some healthy Easter treats for kids make sure you check out Julie's channel if you like this video make sure you hit the like button and subscribe to my channel that's first thing I want you guys to know about this recipe video is that it's extremely simple your kids can help and you're going to want them to help and it doesn't use crazy fancy ingredients you can kind of make it your own and try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for vitamin C so I'm just gonna put about a half a teaspoon in with a ziplock baggie and then shake it around it's super simple and it makes some really tasty and fun and sour likes like a healthy version of Sour Patch Kids so just you wanna shake that around zip it up give it a shake me shake you need help with the zipper what oh good job fine to 300 [Music] not really good mmm the orange one is so good why is that tastes like pink yours is candy that I used to eat some this is like bringing you back to my childhood what is that mmm wanna taste one of the kombucha no that's pretty good too let's do this sour grape also delicious and sour I hope that you guys really enjoyed today's video as always you can check the description box for link to all of the products that I use as well as the recipe is down there too make sure you head over to Julie's channel at a beautiful horizon and I hope you guys have a really great Easter bye bye i likey you", "FUF7LQdscFo": "make your gummy candies better with science I think we're stretching the science a bit we just really wanted to make gummy bears we are using science to make the best gummy candies if it's your first time watching make sure you hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of the fun we have all the ingredients we need and as soon as we put on our safety glasses we have the go-ahead from our Easter Island overlords I'm not entirely comfortable with the implication that wouldn't be safe unless specifically told to be by someone in authority welcome to the real world sister anyways what kind of recipe are we gonna be using cuz there are a lot of gummy candy recipes we are going to be making all of them or five whichever one comes first so basically we'll just have buckets and buckets of gummy candies just sitting here waiting to be eaten yes no no eating the scientific samples unless for documentation purposes strangely the same principle applies when working with mercury samples all the different recipes call for a few of the same ingredients namely water which we'll get later gelatin and some sort of flavoring but there seems to be no consensus on which recipe is the best we will also need something to put the mixture into so that it forms nice gummy shapes so we've got some Lego molds that I got on Amazon and we have some classics like gummy worms and gummy bears and also some fish themed ones let's start off with method number one the one popularized by the king of random we need half a cup of cold water yes it doesn't have to be cold and pour in a quarter cup of corn syrup stir until smooth the theory behind the corn syrup is that it gives the gummies a smoother texture then mix in two packets of gelatin and one package of gelatin give it a few minutes to allow the gelatin to bloom and stir it occasionally heat the mixture up on medium to low and keep stirring occasionally for around 5 minutes when the syrup is liquefied pour it directly into a mold of whatever size you want let it sit for 10 minutes and then skim the top foam off we are using 2 different methods to prep our silicon molds the first method is using some canola oil cooking spray the second method is to sprinkle some cornstarch directly into the mold we are using some clean ketchup containers to squirt into the molds let it sit for around 5 hours then enjoy method number two the something-something fruit method this one is super easy just 1/2 a cup of fruit juice and 2 tablespoons of gelatin and 2 tablespoons of sugar mix all the ingredients into a small saucepan and mix until the gelatin and sugar dissolve completely if any foam forms while stirring skip it off and discard make sure you don't use any fresh juice of tropical fruits like papaya Kiwi or mangoes as they contain an enzyme that will eat the gelatin when it's finished pour it into molds the same as before let it sit for a few hours or you can refrigerate it to make it go a little bit faster method number 3 the sour is power method citric acid is the key apparently this stuff is really sour add one package of jell-o and 10 grams of gelatin to a small pot put in as much citric acid as you want a quarter teaspoon is going to make it sound but go ahead and put in as much as you want in our case a lot add in a third of a cup of cold water and stir then let it bloom for five minutes heat it on medium heat until done pour them into the mold as needed visit number for an easy microwave candy method allow the gelatin to bloom for five minutes in half a cup of cold water add another quarter cup of water and put in the microwave for one minute then mix in the jello and stir until clear put it in the molds and refrigerate for two hours method number five the it's complicated but you can eat it faster method this one is similar to the first one but there are a few more steps we'll need our sugar and gelatin and some sort of flavored liquid we're using Powerade we're also going to need corn syrup and sip your cat's yep there it is combine the sugar gelatin and Powerade in a heatproof container and let it bloom for about five minutes when it's finished stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds then stir gently microwave it again for 15 seconds and then stir if the mixture is not melted continue in 5 second increments until it is add in the corn syrup and citric acid and stir gently let it sit for 10 minutes and then skim the top boom off pour it directly into a mold of whatever size you want then put it in the refrigerator and chill it for 1 hour and then the gummies are ready to eat while we let these set we'll go ahead and explain to you exactly what gelatin is because like most things that you don't understand the basis is swine well most gelatin is produced from pig skin which contains about 30 percent collagen by weight collagen is the connective tissue protein that gives strength to muscles and tendons and resiliency to an animal skin and bones to make gelatin pig skin is soaked in dilute acid for about 24 hours which unravels Lacrosse linking protein bonds in the collagen the resulting free chains are extracted filtered purified and drained into granules powder that are around 90% gelatin eight percent water and 2% salts and glucose when the gelatin blooms it is soaking up the cold water it has to be cold at this point because hot water completely destroys the gelatin ability to set heat causes them to initially unravel and disperse just like any protein they never form new bonds though so the liquid in which they're dispersed stays fluid because gelatin proteins are long stream they tend to become interwoven causing the hot liquid in which they're suspended to thicken but not completely solidified when warm as gelatin cools as inner gummy candies here the protein strands line up next to each other and twist into long ropes transforming the liquid into a firm gel it takes at least another four hours to let these sets so we'll be back the corn syrup is amazing I hate it when no one gets my puns hey so we have allowed these to dry for seven days the longer you let them dry just open air than the chewier they're gonna get so hopefully a little bit more like the store-bought ones these we might have left them a little bit too long they might be a little bit too chewy but that's fine okay first up is the first one we tried which is the one that the king of random made first yeah let's try it hmm so they're chewy like flavor on them though yeah we did use these cooking oil to spray that molds with and it seems like the cooking oil has mostly disappeared that's pretty good they definitely are chewier than doorbot gummies method number two the something-something fruit method yeah I don't have high hopes first reaction imagine saran wrap and wuzzle-buck into a ball with no flavor I'm getting that strong cooking a little flavor okay is easy not so good ilianna just throughout her there goes two for candy there so probably don't make that method unless you're one of those healthy people okay method number three the sour is power we put a lot of citric acid into this so let's see what they taste like mmm much more like mmm that's pretty good white sour mmm but good flavor and they're not super rubbery which is okay so then the fourth method this is the one that took the least amount of time to actually make so they're definitely rubbery oh no not a whole lot of flavor there but definitely better than garbage so that brings us to our last which is takes a little bit more work but can eat them faster method so they're chewy but you can actually bite through which is great let's rank these from the best to the worst thanks for watching we have new content coming out every single week so stay tuned if you like what you saw find that like button down below and stay tuned because bloopers are coming up fish feed ones hey what's the difference between a fish and a guitar you can't tuna fish what's the difference between the octopus and a guitar when made of wood [Music] Wow cake and we have I've been told in no uncertain terms that I am not allowed to make anyone come candies what's alone so what we have here is we have some fish shapes [Music] yeah we have some bear shapes which I can't eat yet because they're not [Music] [Laughter]", "8gNE1zQsC68": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make gummy fruit juice feet really cool really easy let's go now get the saucepan or 2 or 50 depending on how many different types you want to make get 1 cup I'm using apple juice and for the other one I'm using black currant juice so 1 cup of each which is 375 mils now get 3 packets of unflavored gelatin one pack will have 10 grams in it you want to use 15 grams in each so one and a half packets for each the packet I'm using looks like this clear and unflavored gelatin or gelatine just leave that there on the counter for about five minutes let it absorb the crystals and glug afire little now those are ready so what we're going to do now is put them on the stove on low to medium heat until the crystals have dissolved and have become one with the juice well just to give this a stir every now and then until the jelly crystals have dissolved this make sure it's not too hot or want the heat to be low maybe as much as medium but no more okay now that's ready now just turn the heat off set aside for about five to ten minutes just to let it cool down a little bit before we put it in the molds just leave that there for probably about five to ten minutes we don't want this to be completely liquidy we want it to start to strengthen a little bit before we put this in the fridge or freezer now after five to ten minutes I like to put this in the freezer for 30 minutes or you can put it in the fridge for an hour all right these are ready I left them in the freezer for a couple minutes too long and a couple of feet the toes got frostbite but that's okay just like with any mold just take it out there you have gummy fruit juice feet with a bit of frostbite yeah well hope you like these yummy Cheers Oh well was so good so refreshing so as you can see it what will you bubbly just like a gummy should be I'll see you next time for my next meal", "QFJzJ-4js8s": "hey everyone caffeine man here and today i got another caffeinated product for you and that caffeinated product is punched gummies yeah that's right caffeinated gummies i have only done one other review on gummies so i am definitely excited to try these gummies out they come in a variety of flavors i look forward to trying them out with you guys coming right up [Music] hello again everyone thank you so much for joining me today if you want to stay informed on all things campaign related feel free to hit the subscribe button i post new videos every tuesday night as well as one on the weekends and in today's video we got some caffeinated gummies by punched love that name punched gives me something to do on camera punch you guys i'm certain that they came up with a name because they're going to give you a punch of flavor well when the energy hits you it's going to give you a punch of energy but keep doing it someone's going to want to punch me so i'm going to go over the ingredients in this product as well as the health benefits of these ingredients followed by a taste test of all their fruity flavors time stamps and chapters down below so you can go where you want to go in looking at the nutrition facts panel you'll see that the serving size is five gummies in those five gummies you're gonna get 33 calories zero fat one gram of protein zero cholesterol zero sodium four grams of sugar eight grams of carbs as well as three percent of your daily value of iron thirty three percent of daily value of vitamin c and for caffeine you're going to be getting 50 milligrams of caffeine which if you can do the math that is 10 milligrams per gummy i am super excited by that because that means you are going to have ultimate control over your caffeine intake if you want 100 milligrams of caffeine you can eat 10 of these gummies if you only want 80 milligrams of caffeine you can have eight of the gummies and if you just want 50 milligrams well i guess you know you guys can just you guys can do the math it's really really simple but the bottom line it is great for anyone that keeps track of their caffeine i keep track of my caffeine throughout the day but it's even more important at nighttime because at night time let's say it's like six o'clock seven o'clock and you're feeling just like a little bit sluggish you don't want to have a cup of coffee or an energy drink at seven o'clock at night because you might not be able to get to sleep but you don't want to be sluggish for the rest of the night so you just have four gummies for 40 milligrams of caffeine you're all set or if you can handle a little bit more but don't want too much you have six for 60. i mean you can do this in increments of 10 to suit whatever your body needs i love love love having control over the amount of caffeine that you can have i mean granted if you have a 300 bang or rain you could just drink half of it but do you know how hard it is when you're drinking one of those delicious flavors to just stop yourself from drinking especially when you're busy doing something you just keep drinking drinking next thing you know the can's gone and then yoga on running around the house i really like the concept behind 10 milligrams per gummy because listen that means you can actually have more gummies as well i've done several videos where i had a candy and some of the candies had like 50 milligrams of caffeine well you can probably only have one or two of those because you don't want to go too high in your caffeine but if it's a delicious candy don't you want to have like eight or ten of them yeah and what's even better about this is that it's actually natural caffeine so you're going to be getting a longer lasting caffeine out of it and that natural caffeine source is green coffee beans now even though a lot of us love natural caffeine for its longer lasting energy benefits there are also lots of other benefits to green coffee beans they've been known to help with mental and cognitive function help with alertness boost immunity due to the amount of vitamin c burn fat increase your metabolism and even improve your skin and hair health however the rest of the ingredients looking pretty healthy actually they're using all natural and organic ingredients so they're going to be using fruit juice from concentrate organic brown rice syrup organic cane sugar purified water micronized gelatin natural fruit pectin and natural green coffee beans that makes these gluten-free 100 natural allergen free non-gmo nothing artificial and these gummies are also ultra low glycemic therefore since it doesn't raise your blood glucose levels it's a good healthy option for diabetics the caffeine in these gummies will actually hit just a little bit harder too even though it is natural caffeine because you're going to be chewing them and the caffeine will be absorbed through your oral membranes which is known to be absorbed a lot quicker than if you needed to digest the caffeine as for the flavors each pack is a variety pack and it's going to include apple lime grape peach orange and fruit punch this sounds good let's taste them out and here is the container oh it's a huge container there's 200 count in here there are 200 gummies in here oh by the way by the way i forgot to say it yes thank you thank you very much to punch for sending me these gummies they sent them to me in exchange for an honest review and i was just expecting one of the packs that they have because they sell them in smaller bags but they also sell them in a 200 count so thank you to punched for sending me these in exchange for an honest review i appreciate it let's open these bad boys up oh my goodness they're sealed really well gonna have strong strong risk for this ah there we go no lefty loosey righty tighty right i know it's not me i'm a grown adult i know how to open a container not only am i a grown adult i am old on tons of medications i open up these bottles in smaller forms all the time punched what are you doing to me if i can't get it open on the next time you're gonna get punch hope for the best okay you've been warned people gonna be a little tough to open so when you buy these and you go to open it don't think that you're the only one who can't open them but because it's problematic and if you don't have a problem open them you can laugh and say i had caffeine man you can't open bottles what's wrong with you safety seal too i got that one okay [Music] they sell fruity like really fruity i don't know which one to start well i was going to say that the orange and the peach are going to be hard to decipher just looking at them so i am actually going to start off with whatever this one is and i will hold it up to see maybe if my camera can pick it up for you that color yeah just taste it out very chewy mmm i got the good one i'll fast forward all right that one was the peach one got a strong peach flavor out of it and uh they're they're uh they're very gummy very chewy so they're not like super soft but they're definitely not hard but you know you bite into them and you squish down but it doesn't break off right away so you're gonna bite into that hard jelly and you gotta wear it down a little bit and while you're doing that you're getting the caffeine out of it in your saliva you're absorbing the caffeine you're not eating these in like three bites as you could see even though i was fast forwarding it it's gonna take you like a minute to chew it i should have counted how long it takes maybe for the next one i think i am getting a hint of the caffeine in there but overall really liking that peach one it was pretty good i don't put caffeinated products on the caffeine man rating chart i don't know why i don't i just never did it really but i don't see why i can't on the caffeine man rating chart i'm gonna do the peach 8.5 i like peach let's go for the next one i'm going to see if i can pick it out here's a nice dark purple one there we go dark purple i'm assuming that's going to be grape if it's not i'm going to be in for a surprise when i taste it and be like that's not grape what is that ice cream yep that one was definitely grape and i don't know why i'm holding this it's getting kind of heavy because there's 200 of them in there and the grape flavor wasn't as potent as the peach flavor and uh there was actually a little bit of caffeine flavor coming in a little bit more than it did on the peach the peach was able to cover up that caffeine flavor a little bit more and i am getting a little bit more caffeine that bitter flavor is a little bit too much for me but there are plenty of people that like their coffee dark so they like the bitter flavor if you're someone who doesn't mind bitter you're gonna get a little bit out of the grape where's gonna be going on the kathy man rating chart since i started doing i got to keep going with it but i'm gonna give this one a 6.5 i'm more of a sweet person as opposed to bitter next up we're gonna go for a red one which i believe is gonna be the fruit punch should get a nice mix of flavors in there yep that one is better than the grape you are getting a little bit more of a fruity flavor you get a little bit of a stronger flavor and uh but you are still getting a little bit of the caffeine flavor in there definitely not as much as you were from the grape but you can definitely tell that you are getting a little bit of caffeine i think you're getting maybe just slightly more maybe than that peach because that peach was one of the stronger flavors this so far is the second strongest flavor for its fruit punchy flavor and just a touch more caffeine and i'm making sure i'm having some crackers and some water in between to cleanse the palate so that the caffeine flavor isn't really stacking although if you're eating all these at the same time then the caffeine flavor might stack a little bit here is the next one i think this is gonna be orange i didn't pay close enough attention to see if the orange and the peach were different colors and i'm looking and uh i wonder do they have a chart on here no they don't have a chart on here but they got this lighter colored one and that might actually be i'm guessing maybe apple so i'm hoping that i'm going for orange let's taste it out so that was a total of 45 seconds and it wasn't like completely dissolved but it was lots and lots of lots of little gummy pieces in my mouth so that it was easy to swallow i think if you try and get them till they completely dissolve it's going to take like over a minute not that they are hard to chew they're really good to chew as for the flavor i think that orange orange is a strong flavor in general so that orange flavor is really competing with that peach flavor so you're getting a pretty strong flavor out of there and i'm trying to go in that that um that one and not getting too much of that caffeine flavor at all it's probably even less than the peach but yeah no that orange one doesn't have much caffeine flavor at all to it so when we're going and putting on the caffeine man rating chart i'm going to give this one an 8.9 really good flavor really strong orange layer and barely any caffeine taste at all i think i forgot to put the fruit punch up there fruit punch was a 7.5 i think we're down to the last two i think we got apple and lime left i'm going to try and get the apple next then leave that lime for the end because i think the lime i think that's apple doesn't even matter if i show it i know it's just so small i think that lime is going to be a strong lime flavor give orange some competition i'm definitely liking the consistency of these they're um they're they're chewy but they're gummy i like them uh that flavor though that didn't really remind me too much of apple it was more like hints of apple and then as i was chewing it and only getting the hints of apple flavor i was worried that i was going to get some some caffeine flavor because you really need to have a strong potent flavor to cover up that caffeine but i didn't get too much caffeine out of that one either probably got around the same middle amount as fruit punch but the flavor wasn't as strong as fruit punch but it was definitely better than the grape one so if we're putting it on the caffeine man rating chart i'm going to give this one 7.2 it's pretty close to that fruit punch just not as flavorful as that fruit punch and then at the end i'll give you the whole master list and then i'll probably i should probably tell you on a scale of 1 to 10 how much caffeine i can taste too let's get into the lime there you go case you're curious yep lime solid strong lime flavor there um not getting much of that caffeine flavor as well yeah that's a good flavor i'm gonna put it on the caffeine man rating chart and i'm gonna give that an 8.8 and now that we went over that let me give you a better idea of the caffeine flavor because some people don't like the bitter flavor and they want to get a better idea so i think that for the uh caffeine flavor i'm going put it on a one to five scale i want to give it a ten scale i think one to five really condenses it a lot better a one not having very much caffeine flavor at all a five that tastes more like caffeine than fruit so the top ranked ones the orange and the lime on a caffeine level you're only getting like a one you can barely taste the caffeine in it if you're sensitive to bitter taste you might be like oh i can taste a little caffeine in there if you don't mind a little bit of bitter you may not even notice that it's in there next when it comes to the peach you are getting a touch more of that flavor out of there so i'm gonna say that you're probably getting a two for the amount of caffeine that you're getting in the peach then when it comes to the fruit punch and the apple because they're not extremely strong flavors you're getting that caffeine to come through a little bit more and you're probably getting maybe a two and a half i'm not going to give it a three because it really is kind of closer to the peach and i think that it's manageable without it bothering my taste buds too much as for the grape can really get a lot of that caffeine out of the grape i'm gonna say on a scale of one to five you're probably getting a four i actually feel like i'm getting more caffeine flavor than i am grape flavor if you're looking to pick these up you can head on over to punchedenergy.com make sure you spell punched right because there's no e in there and they told me that if you guys want to save 15 off you can use coupon code caffeine and 15 so you get 15 off your order like i said it does come in a variety pack but maybe someday they'll actually go to individual flavors so that you can actually get the flavors that you like as opposed to a mix of ones that you may like and may not like thank you again to punch energy for sending me these gummies to try out really appreciate it and thank all of you for joining me in today's video i hope you enjoyed it until next time have yourself a great

fruit punch that is great for any party it's perfect for spring summer and i'm actually making it this year for my easter brunch so let's get started the first thing we are going to add to our punch bowl today is our orange juice concentrate i have two orange juices that i've let sit out so they're not frozen anymore and i'm just gonna add this in still a little bit frozen there's some splattering here along with one of pink lemonade concentrate and i have a 48 ounce can of dull pineapple juice this is honestly one of my favorite juices i always feel so tropical when i drink it this is gonna be a very large punch so i hope you're thirsty i also have three cups of water just to dilute our concentrate down a bit next you can either add lemon lime soda today i'm using some sprite and you want to add one liter this is a two liter bottle so i'm going to add half of this if you find that this drink is a little bit too sweet for your liking you can always substitute your sprite with sparkling water such as pellegrino to give it a less sweet flavor now it's time to add in our booze today i'm adding in four cups of vodka but if you want this to be kid-friendly don't add an alcohol or you can just leave your alcohol on the side and people can serve themselves but today i'm going to be adding in my vodka so let's do it depending on how boozy you want this drink to be you can always add in less but i found four cups is a pretty good medium amount so if you want an extra boozy you can always add in some more now that is a lot of vodka let's pour in this is no longer kid friendly now on the side i also have my ice ring and it's such a pretty pink color because the way i made it was i used fresh strawberries fresh kiwis and fresh pineapple and then i took one frozen pink lemonade concentrate mixed it with three cups of water and that's what i used to fill up my ice rink let me try to flip it out let's see if she'll come out for me oh it's so cold and that's why it has this lovely pink color it's because of the pink lemonade the last thing we are going to be adding into our punch today is some freshly sliced strawberries as well as some freshly sliced kiwis now my favorite time of shooting any video getting to taste it i also took a little pineapple bunny and put it in my drink like so just to add a little cuteness factor to it i did spill a little bit of it but if i don't spill something in a video i feel like it's not me and doesn't this looks so delicious filled with all that fresh fruit i just love it and now let's taste it that is so delicious it's so fruity i feel like i'm in a tropical land right now drinking it it's so good so please let me know if you try this drink and what you think in the comments down below also if you love party punches as much as i do there should be a playlist right here or over here of all of my delicious punch recipes thank you all so much for watching and i hope to see you next time [Music] cheers you", "dDYW775_CBc": "[Music] yo yo it is good to have you here on truebuds tv for another cannabis edible review i've done tons of these so check out the playlist if you want to see some more edibles before you go to the store and spend a pretty penny here i got this one on ease you can get a discount if it's your first time ordering i'll put that in a comment below we got the punch edibles here this is the fruit snacks first time having the fruit snacks speaking of other reviews i've done a review about their chocolate bars i've had all their chocolate bars i remember when they were the 225 milligrams really packing that punch as advertised so i had about four of these let me go ahead and open them up here i had four the other day when i was chilling but then i was smoking so it was hard to tell the exact strength i can usually tell if it's like that 30. i usually take 30 milligrams because i know how that makes me feel it gets me stoned so i can still kind of do stuff i got some more work to do today but it doesn't make me like 50 or 60 to 100 milligrams where i can just only lay on the couch and zonk out so let's go ahead and eat three i wasn't expecting them to break apart so cleanly like that i thought they were going to be stuck together but they break apart nicely that's three tastes good tastes like some fruit snacks weed flavors in there a little bit taste i give it seven out of ten or so let's see how these kick in and i'll be kicking it back with you in about an hour hour and a half or whatever so i'll see you then and as i thought consistent like every time on these punch edibles so good job on the consistency here if you're going for just taste and you're doing a gummy or something like that sweet i would still steer more towards like emerald sky or like a more handcrafted or you know crafted uh piece of candy but this tastes good potency's there very small and discreet um good for the summer you know it's not chocolate it's not gonna melt all over so thank you punch for another good time about to get busy here got some big stuff in the works for true buds tv and the true buzz show and i want to say thank you for hanging out today drop a comment below what do you want to see next i'll see you on the next review video where we'll be reviewing some other gummies i like to say they're wild [Music] you", "y8VWfqgcHMI": "now I think everyone's gonna agree with this when you buy a pack of fruit guns sugary fruity candies you always eat the red and black ones first let's face it they are the best yeah then you can get the leftover ones Jamie because it isn't any different here go mate doctress ah which is why we're just gonna make the very ones today because why bother with the rest pick your favorite fruit we've gone for a forest fruit selection play we're frozen we've let them defrost and now we're gonna cook them up in a pan with sugar and a dash therefore we're now combined the red and the black ones together to make the ultimate damn sweet winner and one thing to remember for all of these steps is you don't need your hands in your pocket at all times casual casual cooking at this point let them bubble away and tell the various of softened then either blitz off the food processor to make yourself a puree or just force them to a soup just push the berries through a sieve on the back of a spoon because they're nice and soft should be a problem just two guys making fufassel no can you hol get any more just ridiculous don't forget to scrape the bottom because that's where all the little gone through but it's still just clinging on once you've got yourself a fruit purees on to the next stage what's enough stuffing we've got caster sugar liquid glucose citric acid and pectin yeah really is for me what they again we you know what sugar is sugar liquid glucose sugar citric acid lemon yeah and pectin the hetro polysaccharide yeah kind of naturally thing you get out of fruit stabilizers jams it stuff all available in a supermarket they go into the pan and whisk it up nailed it at this point to put your sugar smomid set into the pan and heat the whole mixture up to 105 degrees Celsius some people would argue 116 for pectin when I find it but they've run the game through 105 is fine gives you a nice gummy astral yep when making sweets pellets and creative juices go crazy and the size to make them into squares we've had this argument before squares tessellate better week about testily no we're about fun tasty goodness you don't waste any of this stuff and also important thing though is to double line at the cling film anything that's heat proof other shapes are available like well Steve you think it'd be invented you could cut them into triangles you can cut me show you one but there's no point ahead at this point whip out your sugars monitor and pour it into your mold don't be tempted sit your finger in it because it will be mega mega hot instead let it set up in the fridge or a room temperature for several hours and then it's solid how long several hours and here's one I made earlier from pure rose breeze all we have to do is turn it out with a scattering of sugar cut them up and guess them with more sugar what if it don't like sugar don't think this was for you these are intensely fruity and sweet so much better when you make them self that actually tastes like fruit it's it's worth it's pretty much all it is fruit and sugar and it really it's really intense jammy gummy past few things if you don't believe is health food - they taste you have to make yourself the recipe as ever is linked down below or if you don't like red and black ones make green ones or yellow ones or pink ones or no one likes the green they don't do they ah", "43Hao8Wmm3A": "what's going

"[Music] what's up YouTube today we're gonna make a giant gummy coke bottle using a giant coke bottle let's do this we're gonna have to fill that giant coke bottle so we're gonna need a lot of cokes and some gelatin all right let's put the pot on the stove do not turn on the heat just put the coke in I promise everything will be okay as long as we get the gelatin to dissolve that is our main routine for all these gelatin in here the thing about gelatin and coke mixing together is it makes it super foamy kind of looks like a cupcake now get your giant coke bottle and take off the lid right there oh yeah just like - so we're gonna have to fill this giant coke bottle of coke right but how are we gonna do that so here's a life hack right here just get a random coke liter and then just cut the top right there and this is gonna serve as a funnel for the rest of the coke to go into the other coat and now pour your gelatin and coke into the giant coke bottle I know it gets messy but it's still getting in there like that so just keep doing this until the whole giant coke bottle is filled up with gelatin and go just like that look at all that Coke and now just wipe it clean in preparation for the fridge put it into the fridge and now you wait 10 hours okay everybody it's been 10 hours since I put the coke in there let's see the progress all right still looking the same Oh check this out is it gonna pour out no it's solidified like crazy oh okay so this is the most tedious part and I really got to be careful here because one wrong cuts could either mess up the jello or mess me up so be careful all right we're making progress little by little Romek will make the incision you see here I'm making slow progress so if I use I'm just careful enough oh yeah oh this is

yep go first Chewie take a drug of like very chewing gummy those are very serious you try it mom do you want to try one I firstly don't kiss them the way they do okay so all right good luck and subscribe we'll shout you out down below you did shout you guys out peace", "tczNwJMnG6M": "[Music] today I'm showing you three ways to use agar agar if you've never heard of agar before it's a plant-based gelling agent that's actually made from seaweed and it's most commonly used as a plant-based alternative to gelatin I partnered up with a company called living Djinn who sent me their agar agar to use in all three of these recipes there are a small Korean based health food startup and they've been really patient with me over the last few weeks while I took some time to test out the quality of the product I found that the results I've gotten have been really consistent I also found that I didn't end up using as much of the living gin agar as I have had to use of other brands in the past nor did I have to boil it as long to get good gelling results so if you want to try out any of these recipes or any other agar based recipes at home I would definitely recommend the agar from living Jin I've placed a link in the description below if you want to check it out for the first recipe I'm making gummy bears so most gummy candies are actually made with a ton of gelatin so that can be one kind of off-putting and to really restricting for people with dietary restrictions preferences or religious beliefs so you can actually use agar as a replacement all you need is 250 millilitres of fruit juice six grams of agar [Music] and 25 grams of sugar mix this all together in a pot and boil for one to two minutes it's important to boil any mixture with agar in it because the boiling activates the gelling properties so make sure you get it up to a rolling boil then all you need are some of these super cute gummy bear molds I just got them on Amazon and they came with these little droppers so you can transfer your gummy bear mixture into the molds set them aside to chill in the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes and once they're firm to the touch pop them out of the mold [Music] then you can repeat this process for whatever flavor of gummy candy you'd like one thing I hear often when people make egg are based gummies is that it's hard to get the same true texture but I found a super simple solution to this you just have to dehydrate them a little all I normally do is leave them out on a drying rack for a day or two to dehydrate slightly and then you end up with that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] another great way to use Egger is in puddings panna cotta or mousse today I'm making a matcha green-tea mousse you'll need 150 grams of white chocolate chopped and set aside in a large bowl pour 500 milliliters of coconut milk and 85 grams of honey into a pot and bring to a simmer [Music] pour the simmering liquid over the white chocolate and stir to combine in a separate pop place six grams of agar 7 grams of matcha green-tea powder and three to five tablespoons of water bring this to a boil for one to two minutes for the green tea mixture into the coconut mixture and stir [Music] to get a really smooth consistency blend the mixture on high then transfer it to individual serving bowls and set in the fridge once the matcha mousse is set you can serve it as is or top it with a sprinkle of matcha or sesame seeds [Music] next and probably one of my favorite ways to use Egger is by using it to make gourmet or molecular style recipes for this recipe I'm making grapefruit pearls start by pouring about a liter of neutral flavored oil into a tall container and placing this in the freezer for about one to two hours once your oil is cold get 250 milliliters of grapefruit juice into a pot along with 2 grams of agar powder [Music] bring this up to a boil now for the fun part using a squeeze bottle or syringe stream the grape fruit mixture into the oil and droplets [Music] strain the pearls out from the oil and rinse in cold water you can make these pearls with most liquids I've done these with honey balsamic vinegar and sriracha just to name a few special thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video if you want to try it any of these recipes make sure to check out the link in the description box below and if you're lucky enough to live in LA you can now purchase the living gin agar offline at the Little Tokyo marketplace Los Angeles I'll post links to their social below as well because they post lots of cool recipes

"hey guys what's going on just doing an update here on my drunken gummi bears or the rummy bears we'll call them this is the package we used I'm just really fruit flavored gummy bears but would take a look at our soaking container here and as you can see already the liquid has come down quite a bit this is the current line after one day of soaking when I started that it was actually about I don't know that's about an inch or two above the top of the gummies and as you can tell they've certainly gotten a lot more plump and you know sucked up a lot of that vodka so they're looking good just have a little bit of maybe a day or two to go and you just want to make sure you stir them maybe maybe every eight hours or so to keep them from sticking together I'll try and grab one of the original which is here give you an idea of how much they've already grown it's a little hard to tell but see if we can get it set up here and I will reach into our vodka mixture oh wow they're slippery little guys but they've definitely plumped up already check this out this is pretty sweet I'm surprised okay can you see that on the left-hand side there we've got your regular straight out of the bag gummy bear on the right-hand side that's a 24-hour soak in our vodka so yeah these guys are definitely plumping up I would say after give it say four days you'll expect them to be probably twice this size here so when your friends all come over to have the party it would be a nice alcoholic candy and just be careful you know not to get too crazy because it's easy to just grab a handful and you know that's easily a couple shots of vodka so I think what I'm gonna do here before I put him back for the night is uh top it back off here that last gummy and I'm going to go ahead and add a little bit more vodka because I want to make sure they're all covered at all times so that they continue to soak up this vodka so I'll go ahead and grab my bottle we have the pinnacle tropical punch and like I said when I started out this was a brand new 1.75 liter bottle this is about halfway gone from the first dipping so I'll go ahead and add a little more okay adding some for our little gummy guys and you just want to cover the top of them that looks to be plenty so here we go this is after 24 hours soaked I went ahead and stirred them all around went ahead and reach opt them just to the top of the gummy bear limit with a new little bit more vodka and we'll put it back in the fridge for another 24 hours stirring occasionally and we'll see where we're at tomorrow okay here we are after two full days of soaking as you can tell the gummy bears have swollen quite incredibly I would say they are now easily about three times the original size I actually had to move them to a bigger container which is different here as you can see because they started to swell up that one tube container I was using before and they were about to pop out of the top so this gave us a lot more room for them to grow I also added in if you can see the liquid here see that orange tint to it when I topped off the vodka this morning I also added in about 1/2 of a cup of pulp 3 100% orange juice I figured that would be a good way to get these a little bit of sweetness maybe cut that alcohol taste okay guys here we go I've taken the Bears they've been soaking for about 4 days now in the vodka mixture they've plumped up a very large amount so now they're probably 4 or 5 times our original size during the process you can take a bear take a bite make sure it's to the texture you like if you let them go longer they're going to get softer the shorter time you do the more firm they'll be so whatever you decide is up to you because they were still liquid in the container that I was doing the Bears in I decided I wanted to strain the liquid off so that I can serve them and they're not going to be you know dipping your hands in a bowl of juice or whatever so we went ahead and strain it with the colander and got a pitcher to reserve the liquid as you can see that's full of delicious vodka gummy fruit flavor so out of the 1.75 liter bottle that I used I would say approximately 75 percent of that got used up and then I used about a cup and a half of orange juice but just on the final day stirred that in and that kind of cut the harshness to it so now we've got the gummies I'm gonna let them continue to you know drain off a bit and then we've got our leftover vodka mixture I'll probably add some more vodka some orange some place and you'll have this as a extra cocktail on the side once your gummies are somewhat a dry you can put them in a nice serving bowl and have them for all your friends so enjoy responsibly this is definitely for adults only 21 or older and have fun with your new drunken gummy bears you", "W3iwBHi8Uz0": "hey guys welcome to fit monsters today we're doing drunken gummy bears I got an email from Corey out in Oklahoma City who wants us to try making drunken gummy bears yep exactly what sounds like they're drunk gummy bears we're using Skyy Vodka and Haribo gummy bears today let's see if it works so the first step is to dump out your gummy bears using a plastic container something that's going to hold all the gummy bears some people have just had a tub of Ganga that they bought from the store see you have your tub of gummy bears I got away and now we're going to add the vodka they suggest having the vodka level with the gummy bears so about a cup and a half we've measured Oh now you're supposed to soak this for five days in the fridge every day you're supposed to mix it so they don't stick all together so now we're supposed to let the soap for five days then after five days you're supposed to add the fruit punch concentrate actually I chose fruit punch but you can choose any kind of juice she's like it's supposed to make the taste of the gummy bears not be so vodka like we'll see if it works we're supposed to soak it in the punch for about two days so I'll see you guys the seven days and see if it worked well it's been a long seven days waiting for these babies to get ready so we're going to dump them in the strainer and see if they're ready to party whoa these are yeah like twice the size they were originally as you can see the gummy bear is now twice besides pushy especially like jello does taste like Rocco it tastes like a jello shot does exactly what tastes like it did work so pin trusted as a pinterest for us alright some of you guys have pins at home you'd like is to try email us at bus at investors

collagen gummy bears and this is super simple you probably have some of the stuff laying at home and it's time to use it instead of buying overpriced collagen gummies you can just make your own at home and here are the ingredients you're going to need sugar free jello and today's flavor is cherry this is the 11.2 gram serving so it has one packet in it which is right here then you're going to need some gelatin i really like to use knox gelatin it comes with four packets in it but today we're only going to use three packets that's all you need and the next thing would be let's be careful not to spill this the fruit juice one cup of fruit juice or one cup of water it's up to you i find that with the fruit juice it sweetens it up a little bit i am using peach fruit juice also need the molds of course the gummy bear molds and i got these on amazon i've already sprayed them with a light coating of cooking oil and then i wiped off the excess and a dropper for your gummy bear molds okay so let's get started so the other thing that you're going to need is the cooking pot for the stove first thing we're going to do here is pour our fruit juice into the pot and you're going to add your jello packet okay and you're going to add the gelatin with the gelatin you want to uh sprinkle it on there it helps the gelatin get in there a lot better here mmm it smells so good i can smell the cherry flavor one pocket my camera cut out but i did add the other two packets of the gelatin so there's three packets of gelatin in total here now we're gonna let this entire mixture sit for five minutes as you can see it's quite thick we're gonna heat this up on low and continue stirring frequently until everything is liquefied [Music] okay so everything is pretty much liquefied see so we're going to heat this up for another five minutes on low whatever you do do not let this boil if you boil it it can totally ruin the entire mixture so let's just take it slow [Music] i have shut it off here we go nice and liquidy very hot so we're going to take our dropper and we're going to drop them right into our molds [Music] so i actually have three trays full i had two full and then i realized there was still more so three trays is just perfect for this recipe now let these sit for 10 minutes in the molds after 10 minutes we're going to put these in the fridge and you want to leave them in there for three hours after that they should be perfect and ready to try out [Music] hey [Music] you", "pa9WPUqlEto": "(festive Latin music) - [Voiceover] That's a sharp knife!

that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "dsQBzIqVe8M": "I think once down under sharing has any fresh strawberry gummy candies and used sugar substitute to save calories but it's off to you so I hope you get an idea how to make it and then he'll pick it try it out oh by the way if you use juice with no pop the texture will be more elastic like gummy candies so that stores okay so first coat a tray with oil put strawberries in a blender add sugar I'm using sugar substitute add water then process until smooth now you need gelatin powder add water place it over a bowl of hot water and stir until the gelatin dissolves place the strawberry mixture in the small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to simmer now stop the heat and add the gelatin mixture and continue stirring until the gelatin completely dissolves pour the mixture into the tray then put in the fridge for about 30 minutes until set remove the gummies from the tray and now it's done thanks for watching I hope enjoyed this tutorial you",

going on guys I have beyond drawers lit coming up next we got a full review taste test and pros and cons we about to get lip [Music] welcome back guys it's David with what's up best online supple reviews today again I've got the ondraw lid from GNC now they did have a prior version in a yellow packaging that I reclaim did not taste good so actually I've never tried it this would be my first time trying GN C's be on Raw live super excited to try it I've read the ingredients it does have a great lineup first thing we're to talk about is the caffeine 250 milligrams for me that's right the sweet spot I do like my caffeine to be right around 200 milligrams but nothing more than the 300 milligram range now they do say a tobacco label built by science driven through obsession elevated through innovation and everything is clinically dosed I'm going to talk about that right now first ingredient next to it is bit alanine 3.2 grams that is going to combat fatigue when you're working out all your muscles produce lactic acid it's going to sort your muscles and kind of fight off that burning feeling allowing to do a few extra reps maybe more the Krait same monohydrate 1.5 grams I'm definitely paying about creatine you want to get extra water to cells a little bit more strength that is a good ingredient to have in there as well the new greedy is Ellen LOV ATP now it's doing some research on that it says it's supposed to increase ATP production allowing you to get even more reps out of it now with that being said you're going to build a lot more lactic acid if this does work therefore the 3.2 grams of beta-alanine and next one is the neuro factor which is the coffee fruit and bean they used to just put the coffee bean in there now they include the fruit and what they said that would do is actually give you more mental stimulation in the gym and now for the pump l-citrulline in nitrogen which is arginine and silicate bonded together now they are claiming that there is a 200 to 300 percent increase vs. and normal arginine hydrochloride so I'm actually going to test that out I'm very excited to find out if that's the case if this is a better form of arginine or not now we're going to taste it right now see how it tastes gummy worm flavor they do have I'll let you guys actually look inside they do actually have a dry stick inside that is for when they are transporting to let's say GNC or especially down in the south of your Florida there is massive amounts of community down here it's a nice air-conditioned warehouse it gets put in a 90 degree truck and then it gets put back into a G and C which is 70 degrees or so and then you get the heavy build up from that rapid change of temperature alright guys see how this tastes this is the new gummy worm flavor yo that is so good that is very good well done I'm definitely a definitely fan of this flavor I will definitely be getting this next time all right guys I'm going to finish the rest of this I'm going to go hit the gym and then come up next I'm going to tell you what you expect from Beyond Rawls lids new pre-workout see you guys you what's up guys it's David I'm ready to finish that beyond wrong lit review let's go over some pros first earlier in the video I talked about the LAV ATP being able to produce more ATP in your cells giving more energy I did notice when I was finished with the workouts I did have a shorter recovery time I did notice I guys next the arginine silicate they say that it is 200 to 300 percent more effective than an arginine hydrochloride I did notice on a few exercises only I was able to lift a few more reps but I did get a little bit more strength out of this workout and lastly let's talk about the mental focus which comes from the cup caffeine Arabica fruit I did not really notice anything as far as mental stimulation so there's nothing really to report there the price per scoop guys 39.99 on the GMC website at the time of making this video and I believe Amazon has it at $39.99 as well 30 scoops such a dollar 33 a scoop that is over a dollar but considering what the spear about is all the ingredients in here it's a great view workout it's definitely worth a dollar 33 of scoop overall rating of the pre-workout I loved it guys including the tapes the gummy worm flavor taste is awesome it's definitely an intermediate pre-workout if you're thinking about trying to workout you've never tried one before I would hold off and to get more experience with it because it does have a lot of extra ingredients that a normal pre-workout does not okay guys thank you so much for watching the video and hanging out with me today I left a link in the description for this pre-workout you guys want to check it out make sure you hit like and subscribe I do do weekly video and remember guys I try before you buy see you next time on the next what's up review [Music] you Oh [Music]", "If6AqXeX2yg": "[Music] hey I'm Jeff and I'm Phil and we're the cocktail dudes today we're gonna make gummy bear cocktails oh my gosh we're a couple of crazy guys army we're gonna show you in this video pretty much how to make any cocktail into a gummy bear that's right thank you it's not that hard is it no not at all we had to get in touch with some of our College chemistry professors but there's a little chemistry involved here we're not gonna go into all that right right in a great depth but we didn't know what lessons are professors were did we know yeah you do with students all the time non-stop right yeah so we're gonna show you how to make a Negroni gummy bear mm-hmm but we're gonna talk about it in general terms too so that you can bash in any of your favorite cocktails into a gummy bear that's right not just cocktails but favorite spirit yep you can do different liquors and then instead of mixing a cocktail in a glass you can just that's the fun part so Joey bears are the kind you buy at Walgreens are some sort of fruit juice or fruit flavored juice mixed with gelatin right which is this stuff here that's what isn't your jello right citric acid sometimes if it's a tart gummy bear right and then sorbitol right so we're tells assert sugar alcohol seen nationally in apples and pears and peaches plums stuff like that but when you combine it with the gelatin it firms up the gelatin right yeah that really creates the viscosity but it also creates a higher melting temperature right so that way it will stay more all congeal together like the gummy bear it does even everyone covered yeah kind of class societies plasticize is it a little bit and it's the sorbitol mix with gelatin that they used in the gel caps and medicines and stuff that gives it that firmness right also all right and the things that you need we needed to talk about in gym when making gummy bear cocktails esta Lucien mm-hmm evaporation and coloration right right so dilution is because you need to add some water to this right mm-hmm yeah when you're mixing a regular cocktail you're gonna mix a cocktail with ice then you may even pour it over ice so you're gonna get some melting of that ice that's gonna add water to the cocktail here if we just make the cocktail and then put it together and put it in the gummy bear it's gonna be too strong so we actually add some water typically about half of an ounce to account for that dilution that the ice usually provides regular cocktail now the amount of gelatin we use and the amount of sorbitol in this recipe is for a regular-sized cocktail which is anywhere between three and a half and five ounces right so if you're you making an old-fashioned for example which is just two ounces or if you're turning some liqueurs or The Cure's into gummy bears you want to start with four ounces of liquid plus or minus so for the old-fashioned for example you would double that recipe exact right because all the recipes are geared for using one tablespoon of gelatin and reason the Knox brand here and if you buy it in the box here they come with these little envelopes and this is a tablespoon so it's eard for that breezy you see we're gonna make a lot gonna buy this 16 ounce size so the 1 tablespoon of gelatin and 2 teaspoons of the powdered sorbitol and that's what you make for your cocktail right and with the gelatin you're looking for a bloom of 225 anything lower then that's what they use more for jellies and jello so we want something that's that has a higher bloom of 225 to really make sure we get that gum gummy bear cases yeah the bloom isn't a measure of the thickness that the product is going to end up all right so you run a hide them like that now we have to talk about coloration right because now if you're making like this for example is a Negroni that comes out nice and cherry red right but a lot of cocktails aren't touched that way for example here this is our the old-fashioned cocktail commuters and if you don't use my food coloring you're gonna get this sort of tan color here which is not all that appetizing right it's not really what you would think of as far as color when you're thinking in an old-fashioned so look a couple drops of round food coloring will make them look like an old-fashioned and we use these like for example the the brown for the old-fashioned is here we buy this variety pack and we like putting a little food coloring in all of them because it kind of just brightens them up this is geared for it's a frosting gel that comes out and drops but it's geared for cake icing and frostings little things like that right so when gummy bears come off of the assembly line they're what they're called toothsome right they just grab them as in like you can bite them and pull them apart right it's the fact that they sit on the shelves at Walgreens and are exposed to the air that makes them rubbery because some of the fruit juice and liquids have evaporated right right and with liquor the ethanol that more readily evaporates and so there's an issue with the gummy bears where you're gonna get some evaporation once you make the gummy bears if you just leave them set out you're gonna really evaporate off all the liquor and the flavor so when you make these you want to make sure that one they only have a shelf life of about two to three weeks and then you want to make sure that you keep them covered so once you make them you want to make sure that they stay in an airtight container or keep them in the tray and put saran wrap over the top that way then when you go to serve them the last a couple hours but you don't want to leave them sitting up - yeah because that losses will be gone and you just have something to eat which is right very flavorful exactly so and this is a mobile use it's a silicon mold but that we buy and it comes in this packet here with two of them and a little eyedropper and the eyedropper is important because that's what you used to fill up with and it's difficult to be pouring these things in from a beaker otherwise but they're nice you don't need to spray them with anything that you just want to say so you just pop them right out and put them still them to your guests or put them in your mouth right right so we've talked about the dilution the coloration and evaporation those are the main things right there are coupled through juices that don't do well with gelatin that's right if you're using fresh pineapple guava mango Kiwi or papaya those have little proteases that will break down the collagen and not let them to bare set right so you can boil these juices and deactivate those proteases and it won't break down the gelatin pineapple if you're using pineapple from the can it in the canning process they already boil it so that'll be perfectly fine yeah so we're gonna show you how to make a Negroni cocktail dummy beer but as fill the literature earlier it's fun to do spirits individually right and put them in your mouth now when you're doing we're gonna give you just an overview of some of those of the liquors and spirits and stuff that we've done so that you get an idea of how to do that this is our chartreuse gummy bear so here we have just four ounces of green chartreuse 1/2 ounce of water tablespoon of gelatin and 2 teaspoons of serveth all right absinthe here beside it absinthe is not particularly sweet so to our four ounces of absinthe we add 1 ounce of simple syrup mm-hmm and then the gelatin and sorbitol if you're doing a low proof like a wine or champagne this is a rose a champagne for example you don't need to add any sort of water it's just runs with champagne the gelatin and the turbot all right and so once you have your gummy bears that have the different liquors you can literally just mix one in your mouth so if you want to have a Negroni you can take your gin your Campari and your sweet vermouth take one of each pop it in your mouth chew it up and raw mix it together and you got a nice big row yep or don't put don't take the gin take the Bourbon Aparri excuse me with and you have your boulevardier exact right so that's a fun way to do it to make the Negroni gummy bear cocktail to a small soft spot you want to add one and a half ounces of gin one and a half ounces of Campari one and a half ounces of sweet vermouth half ounce of water the two teaspoons of sorbitol and then one tablespoon of the unflavored gelatin powder and you just want to kind of sift that over the top so it doesn't go in and form large clumps once that's in there let it sit on the counter top for 10 minutes after 10 minutes we'll take it to the range and turn on the flame to the lowest amount possible you want to warm this up and stir it constantly to dissolve the gelatin you do not want to bring it to a boil and if you start smelling a burning type of smell you want to turn off the heat but stir it around the tiny little starlight sparkles in there are the gelatin granules so you want to keep your eye on those and just stir it until they're all dissolved once this dissolved we'll take it over to our mold and fill up our silicon mold bears and you want to fill it just proud of the top so the back of the gummy bear is nice and round each cocktail will make about a hundred gummy bears once it's full let it sit on the countertop for about 30 minutes just so they initially set so you can move them around then move them into the refrigerator and they've been set firmly for at least an hour after an hour or two in the refrigerator bring them out if you're not serving them right away you want to wrap them in saran wrap and just keep them in the refrigerator if you're serving them just pop them out like this they will stick a little bit to each other not terribly so but if that bothers you you can do what they do at the factory and that is add a little bit of food grade mineral oil to them just a couple of drops too much and it will cause the runs so be careful and then just fix them together with your hand to get them all coated and then they will sit well together so that's how we make our gummybear Negroni it's kind of a template for our you can make all the gummy bear cocktails just kind of take your favorite cocktail experiment and have fun yeah we use fresh lemon juice lime juice and you can do that or even substitute citric acid so just add one eighth of a teaspoon of citric acid in place of your lime or lemon juice in your margarita or gimlet or a whiskey sour or things like that and if you're using fresh citrus juice make sure that you use a fine mesh sieve to strain out the pulp when you make that cocktail we do that so the pulp from the citrus isn't a distraction from being able to see the gelatin dissolve and once you get these cocktails and the technique under your belt and when you go off the wagon then you get yourself a large gummy bear mold and make yourself a giant gummy bear I've still that's right enjoy Cheers you", "Ey3xP25kuWg": "[Music] welcome to my kitchen my name is Chad Mitchell and I'm a senior scientist with Carlos North America food applications team I have been asked to talk about how we are continuing to support our customers with R&D from our home workspaces before we were asked to transition to homework I had a few projects with sugar reduction that came up they range from cereal coatings to cereal puffs to frosting and to gummies so we had to decide obviously for coating cereal I need a bigger piece of equipment so that was out but frosting and gummies hey I can do that at home so before we were asked to work from home we were able to grab a few items have a scale an induction plate a thermometer a mixer and the rest has been make it up as you go basically on some of these things so that's been fun and interesting so we're gonna talk about some of the sugar reduction hurdles I've been able to look at while I've been at home and we're gonna focus on a pectin gummy today so right away when I hear sugar reduction the first thing is I always ask is what am i comparing this to is this gonna be a brand new product and you want to compare it to something on the market or is this an existing product and you need to match it in a gold standard way and obviously if it's matching a gold standard and even if it's a new product we want to know about the flavor the texture and the appearance and many times those will have definite set guardrails on there and some of them might be it taste needs to be number one we're flexible on texture and the parents we're okay I think we'll be able to fall into that window so we always try and set a hierarchy that way another thing I always ask is what is on your in and out ingredient list what what are you looking to do do you have something that specifically cannot be used or is there something that you would really like to be used and what are some of the goals of that sugar reduction so then it would be the claims are we looking at a calorie reduction are we looking for we had a sugar reduction do we want to add fiber to this product or other than neutral nutrient benefits so that's where I kind of start there and then the fourth thing is I like to always think about is processing corn syrup I should say syrup is not syrup I mean in a powder is not necessarily a powder so therefore you have to kind of think about all those things because it may look great on a formula or nutrition facts panel they may look okay you know in the beginning and during the processing but then also how does it look in the finish so we have to take it all the way through so we're in a quick jump in here right now today I'm actually going to be looking at using some erythritol to reduce the sugar so I'm preheating I have corn syrup sugar and erythritol in here and I've preheated this I always preheat my syrup here so that I can not shocked my pectin when I put that in there my pectin has been hydrating back here in the mixer I'd 190 degrees Fahrenheit so it's nice and in its functional place all right that looks pretty good so I'm going to turn that off and grab the pectin and we'll add the pectin probably my mixer going a little bit too fast all right there we go it's also working from home we have not I don't have all the big equipment like our pH meters and our refractometers but I've designed some Excel spreadsheets so that we can know how far I need to how much moisture I need to drive off to get to the correct solid range for a pectin gummy which is between 76 and 78 solids all right so 21 27.2 so I'm going to start this heating up I got a quick write down that number so we'll go to about that range right there all right so now I'm going to continue this to heat this up and concentrate the material and while this is working here I've set a timer so I kind of know what that is I have the scale here so I'll be able to watch how much moisture I've driven off of the product here and we'll continue carry on so the thought behind this was I was in a door with rat all to reduce some of the calories and obviously reduce the sugar I also added it to my pectin to get it into a nice happy place so talking about ingredients and thinking as they've gone in here now so yesterday I actually made some gummies with some corn bran and then I also made gummy with store Batol isomalt and our chicory root fiber are liquid inulin and they all had some very different things that that I watch for as I put them into the pot so as I'm thinking about processing and seeing how the ingredients are different so Lydia my daughter Lydia is helping me out today video tape so here is a simple example of 75 grams of water and then 25 grams of the powder so here this one is sugar and you can look underneath there room-temperature water pretty well dissolved here's 25 grams of bran and kind of see it's a little bit more viscous it's still kind of global and then here's the Arista tog in it at room temperature water there's a few little crystals left in there they're pretty well dissolved so thinking about that so just that a little bit of a change there keep working this here so again my formulation of my spreadsheet tells me what a temperature and about a weight that I need to drive off for moisture and then one other thing while we're waiting it to get to temperature their syrups this one is our corn syrup you can kind of see and then here is our chicory root fiber our liquid in Ulan so I'm just going to take and dump these out so chicory root Fiber has a lower viscosity and the 43 is working its way out there so that's one of the things you have to consider when also reformulating and thinking about the process and it also affects your processing time as well because now if you have more moisture you need to cook longer or got a good boil here when I turn down the temperature a little bit keep mixing keep mixing so again so the process here so where we would at be at currently as we thought about the ingredients that we needed and we wanted to look at in reducing the sugar we kind of looked at them on the bench top and said okay I see how they're gonna line up now I'm putting them into the process of cooking them down and putting them into the place where the pectin wants to function and then we'll see how the other ingredients react in that area and once we have these deposited I'll show you some of the things that we look for and work through on the rest of the way there so we're this pectin batch is about a 5 minute or so boil kind of seen that pretty consistently with this type of a formula and we'll also see the weights here see we're at here we're getting closer about what a minute and a half away tour so it's got a good boil and then today another thing it's a great thing being at home learning to work at home you had to deal with zoom meetings school but also wonderfully great questions I've been able to actually dig in a little bit deeper and explain what's going on and then my daughter's have helped me with picking out flavors so today this is going to be a strawberry flavor I don't have access to a library but I have access to mcCormick at the grocery store our lay our colors are also grocery store colors so getting creative that way I'll show you when we get over to our starch molds over here how we've had to be creative with that as well here that's the other thing too is with benchtop space it's not quite like being in the lab you can only have so much space because if you start approaching on your kitchen table everybody else is a workspace doesn't make for happy co-workers if you know them saying all right so let's see we are just about there couple more grams of moisture loss and we should be right about the target solids they're a positive temperature see what we're at here yep we're about just a touch away in the temperature as well so it's looking all very consistent to a full sugar product all right we're at the target stalls where we need to be turn off the heat we'll let it cool down a little bit not a nice thing is I got the breeze coming in from outside so it's kind of work nice to work in your kitchen this way all right so I would say this process of the erythritol in there process very very similarly so today it's gonna be green strawberry erythritol gummies so this would be the point if I wanted to add some sweetener high intensity sweetener I would do that I won't necessarily always do it on the first try I would probably wait to the next one because I want to see how the flavor might just have packed it in general so I will just keep the high intensity sweetener out there out of there for right now here we go here's the strawberry flavor or extract that smells good good choice alright and then next I'm just gonna add our acid which will start the process of the pectin wanting to set both the solids and the acid will help it want to set here so stir this in and then you know go grab a funnel here and then we'll meet you over at the starch molds I'm also using a silicon mold because that's becoming more prevalent in the space as well that does require a little bit different solids and a little bit different temperature on the progress and there all right there we go funnel and spit in a hot oven so that way the product will flow and now we're just gonna go oh I got to move my mold there so we had to get creative with our molds since I didn't have a mold at home but I have some very resourceful kids that we're able to help me out so now we'll see again looking at this part of the process it's flowing nicely so I would say that we're looking really good this erythritol in there it's looking good try and make some of these because I will be saving these to look at in 24 hours we'll check out the texture see what's going on see how the flavor might have changed and plus they're just kind of really good to snack on they're fresh these will not be going to any customers just if anybody's curious on that this is literally I'm working through stuff here so that way when I get back in the lab I know where to start so I can continue on and moving in a fast manner and get you out samples that would meet your needs and also at that time potentially add the high intensity sweeteners real flavors from some of our different suppliers and there we go and then this is what was left in the pan we gonna make one giant gummy so where we are already so we've gone from hmm we've asked all these questions we picked up we wanted to try erythritol in there and see how that would work now we went through the process it looked good we put it in the starch in a silicone mold to see how they might react differently at this solids and then have you come over here Lydia we'll look at this so this was actually made yesterday so this was an L 90 43 de coeur and sarah sorbitol isomalt gummy so one way to check is so now that's sat in there we'll cut that and just see what does the inside look like another one that we made yesterday was this gummy worm with corn bran and gelatin and then after that I've had to go out and I really remove the starch from it just like you would in the plant I don't have a really good polish so again I've gotten creative I used some nonstick spray on the gummies that's kind of what they look like they're coming out and again we can check these since I polished them now we'll see you can see I got a little bit of air bubbles in there but I'll do the fingernail test cut and see how clear and go to set I have in there it cut pretty clean probably got a little bit of air bubbles in there because going fast here at home but there it is in a nutshell so again final recap on on sugar reduction at home is still the same thing would be in the lab I need to ask the questions of is it new is it existing what is in what is out how why are there claims that need to be made and then how is it going to process and then finally what is that final taste and texture and 22 high intensity sweetener gonna need to change the flavor out of these ingredients work with your existing flavors so as you can see it's doable it's fun working with family at home but thank you for joining me in my kitchen again my name is Chad Rishel if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me or if you have a car you'll contact currently please reach out to them with any questions or ingredient questions we want to continue to help you drive your projects forward during this time and in the future so looking forward to working with you thank you and take care [Music]", "ppi0khS0s_8": "you want to taste this at your gas in it's pretty sour okay oh my god you better water everyone I'm Claire I'm in the v8s kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "AHcOXyzUeak": "okay for our next recipe we're going to making a fruit punch using four of the major fruit bases fantastic product superb and they really lift any dish so to start with we're going to be using the Clementine we've got one and a half teaspoons of Clementine major fruit base we've got one teaspoon of strawberry major fruit base we've got raspberry fantastic real get a sense of raspberry freshness that comes through straightaway and we've got again one teaspoon of the raspberry the cherry one gain it gives a great superb flavor just to give it a little lift and a little bit of color as well gonna put a bit of grenadine through there so for the grounding we've got two tablespoons and powdered sugar just half an ounce of powdered sugar okay we've got a selection of fruits we've got really finely diced melon apples grapes strawberries and oranges and you want a pound for that and then we've got two cups of soda water it's a great quick simple recipe ideal for any summer afternoon lazy summer afternoon so the water into a bowl is that we're going to put our grenadine we're going to put our powdered sugar and then we're just going to put in a selection of major fruit bases first the Clementine made your strawberry fruit base so in there with all those I you know that is fantastic that really is ideal for summer afternoon got the raspberry and finally the cherry one gain it gives a great superb flavor really really superb ok once all those fruit bases of dissolved just pour over your fruit ideally you'd probably want to let that just stand there probably just for 10 minutes or so to allow the flavors to come through but I haven't got time for that because I'm going to try some now this looks absolutely fantastic you know what that's a fruit punch that really packs a punch", "cTcn2Qzj3gY": "\u266a\u266a Narrator:\nGUMMY

MEANWHILE, SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF\nWATER AND GLUCOSE ARE DISPENSED INTO THE TANK. \u266a\u266a IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO BLEND THE INGREDIENTS\nFOR THE GELATIN BASE. THEN, THE GUMMY VITAMIN BASE IS TRANSFERRED TO\nA LARGE HOLDING TANK. IN THE LAB, THE NUTRITIONAL\nMIXTURE IS TESTED FOR CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS\nHEAVY METALS AND BACTERIA. AN AUTOMATED SYRINGE INJECTS\nTHE SOLUTIONS INTO TEST TUBES, RINSING IN BETWEEN INJECTIONS. NOW THE SAMPLES IN THE TEST\nTUBES ARE READY TO BE ANALYZED.

there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "s1271Tn7Blc": "[Music] that's right you see what's up the booze is out and there's some candy here so what's the EJ gonna do he's gonna make some drunken ass gummy bears today that's right you know if I'm making some candy or a tree for a party you know what's got boobs involved in it that's right that's how we roll around here at DJ's brew to making the alcoholic fun well yeah anyways so we're gonna make some drunken gummy bears today or also I guess you could call them vodka infused gummy bears how are we gonna do this well we're gonna buy some gummy bears first here we've got a bag of gummy bears we've opened what type of gummy bears do you want to get you can't want to get ones that are clear there's some that are out there that aren't clear now they have less gelatin in them so they stay hard also I found that the harrybo brand of gummy bears are too hard also they are really dense and dry and it takes them a long time to diffuse like probably five days plus if you buy the ones that are super soft gummy bears they call them nowadays they won't hold up to the vodkas so just by everyday plain old dollar store type gummy bears not harrybo brand get ones you like to taste up because that's what it's gonna taste like when you're slamming it down anyways real easy we got like I said our gummy bears are gonna 5 ounce bag here and we've got a bottle of vodka mm-hmm and we have two mason jars what are we gonna do we're gonna put the bears into the mason jars top them off with vodka close it and let them sit for two days so we've got a real you know complex process here we've got our bag and our jar these have been sanitized already I like mason jars why well if you put them in a bowl what you can do the problem with that is you can't shake them okay or if you can't shake them it gets all over the place it or if you have to stir them sometimes it disturbs and breaks the gummy bears okay so here we have our two mason jars nice and sanitized and ready to go okay we've got our vodka we want to cover them with vodka inside the jar get them all happy this how we're going to get drunken gummy bears I've swirled them here we go let him go for a little bit of a swim I'm gonna go over the top oh I have to get some more vodka soon what a shame I have to go to the liquor store and shop for booze I hate that anyway so we have our jars here and each one has about an equal amount there over the top with vodka we're about a cup of vodka I think there's a little few more gummy bears in this one but anyways we've used about a cup total of vodka here real easy you can use any vodka you know what abused really cheap vodka sometimes you can taste that but you know what for the people who are gonna be drinking this and how you drink it it's not really for the taste is to get krump snell isn't it so we're gonna shake it let's be honest right give them a good shake boom and we're gonna let these sit for two days I'll be back after these guys get happy and they're getting their drink on now back in a flash hey guys forgot to mention one thing I know I didn't forget it because of all the drinking I do it's it's it's because I was so excited about this process anyways remember when yours letting me set for your two days you want to keep them in the refrigerator that'll help keep the gelatin together or while they're absorbing all this fun booze and you want to give them a little bit of shake now and again over the two day period so I'll see you in two days we'll be back and we're going to be having some fun with some big-ass gummies that are all full of smelly [Music] two days pass and as you can see here our gummies have drunk enough all that lovely vodka so now we have drunken gummies or fun alcoholic gummies that's right they've consumed all the vodka they've over doubled in size in the two days this particular brand seems to be doing really well in this real absorbent my tasted one of them and they're a little bit boozy so you say DJ what do you do if they're a little bit boozy and it all depends different gummies will taste sweeter than others because you know every mix and everything is a little bit different so I'm gonna reserve this one jar that has the last gummies in it and I think that some people will maybe like to taste that vodka and alcohol a little bit and some people won't so what do we do to counteract that we get some kool-aid concentrate here it's these little squirt bottles you can support this into your sports bottle make a quick bottle of sugar-free kool-aid or you can use it which it's real purpose is probably to put it into our gummies and we're gonna give them a little bit of kool-aid flavor and I'm gonna taste one of these here just in case for scientific purposes only and also to show you how much bigger that gummy is now he's really growing in size you can let me see I guess you can see them on the camera here I don't want to tip off but this is a green one let's see how it tastes hmm I still got that lime flavor when you chew it and eat it it has a consistency of jell-o now so I know these are just right it's got that vodka edge to it I know some of the ladies at the party aren't gonna like that vodka edge that's really who's gonna be eating these ladies and some of guys I want to get there quick crunk on so I'm gonna shake this up and this stuff's pretty powerful so you don't need a lot of it we're gonna put one two three four squirts in there that's it now alternately if you don't have this you can use concentrate for making like like fruit punch you know frozen concentrates it's just all it's basically the same kind of thing but this is a lot easier and we're gonna shake these up or but our gummies are bleeding now you can see all that alcohol and lovely booze and the sugar that's rendered out the gummies is sticking to the inside there so we're gonna let this get happy for another day I'll be back in another day it'll seem like a second for you but we'll have these four side-by-side comparison and we'll show you what they look like after they've absorbed some of this kool-aid concentrate and I'll tell you have to taste it hey guys I'm back you can see we got our two jars of gummies here one with concentrate for 24 hours and one without that have been still sitting happy in their liquid of happiness aka vodka and as you can see in the jars there's not too much liquid left but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna strain them out in with this little wire strainer here into our measuring cup and we'll show you how much rendered liquid is left leftover and I'll be back [Music] okay we're all done straining there are dummies out and look at what we've got here we've got two full bowls of our dummies we've got our ones that are flavored with the cherry kool-aid concentrate here on the on my right and we've got one without on the left now there looks like there's more in this bowl because there's more total gummies but they're all about the same size Dave mmm well more than doubled in size close to tripled and I think these ones here on the right with the concentrate maybe a little bigger because I have more vodka in the in the jar with those but if you take a look here on my measuring cup I've got a full math probably bout a quarter cup left now it's probably not all volume that's been generated by vodka because there's a little probably like gelatin like I don't know runoff from the gummies in there but that means these have absorbed probably a cup and a quarter of vodka into these guys so we've nearly tripled their size we've put all that lovely vodka in there and we flavor this and you say DJ what are those flavor Woods tastes like so got my spoon here let's show you what one of these guys look like I think this one was clear or orange in the beginning you can take a look at him or her whatever the case may be I think it's neuter in gummy bear land but let's see what these taste like oh yeah the flavored ones are super dangerous guys that kool-aid kool-aid concentrate really takes the edge off the vodka you can still tell us there because he'll they nearly tripled their size with vodka so you're gonna taste a little bit of boost but you could down a couple those and get blasted in a hurry and that's what little treats like this are for at a party when you're having a fun party but remember when you're enjoying this stuff you got to enjoy responsibility and if you got a guess that you're giving these two you also need to be good to them too and make sure they're not driving and being tanked up going home when they're paddling some of these buildings wow you can feel the warming going down on these guys but the way you take these the part of the way I like to take them apart is you take your jar here we'll clean this out before we do so and I like to take them in this jar here because it's got so that like moonshine look to it and it kind of makes them cool so you see we got real easy steps to make these dangerous little treat real tasty and if you've got folks that don't like that alcohol edge we know heading out how to take that alcohol edge off of these gummies and you can get your party on so guys thanks a million for watching I appreciate each and every one of you until the next DJ brew tube I guess this is kind of a mixed drink how-to I still haven't figured it out well maybe party libation how to or maybe it's not a libation because that means you're drinking um I don't know until the next ev32 thanks a million for watching and that's a big ass [Music]", "HtyTfyg-uYE": "what's

everybody welcome back welcome back to cook miss so today we are making some cranberry gummy bears so I'm sure you guys know that I've made a bunch of different gummy bear recipes in the past and I thought I'd kind of make them into like a holiday flavor these days super refreshing and they're so pretty and I think it'd be really cute touch to any Christmas party because there's still holiday themed but they're like a traditional candy they're super easy to make you can make these out of whim super super simple so let's get started so first one is sprinkle the gelatin into the water and let it develop for five minutes pour the cranberry juice into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until it's fully dissolved then pour the liquid into a container with an easy pour spout and pour into a gummy bear mold and if you find that the color isn't as bright you add a couple drops of red food coloring just to boost up the color a little bit then place the holed in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully sat for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or you can pop a couple into some champagne glasses and top with champagne for a cute festive touch to your cocktail and you are done so I thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe if you guys follow me on snapchat you know there is another like festive gummy bear recipe coming up soon so make sure to stay tuned for that and I will see you tomorrow for an all new recipe [Music]", "g6A5U7nJ_a0": "looking for a way to make your own vegan cannabis-infused gummies at home in

because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have them there ready for you whenever you want them let us know what you think about this do you like making edibles at home would you ever try this recipe have you tried this recipe let us know what you

get the healthy ones they can be really expensive because the thing is a lot of them are filled with additives that fill with dyes synthetic ingredients a loved one from the health food stores no we're talking I'm talking regular ones when you make your own you control what's in them and if you buy these very healthy ones super expensive yeah I'm going to show you how to make them well let's show show us how miss Barrett what do we often as well that is okay that really do that is it's such an easy recipe that's what I love about it look how pretty they are as well pretty so what you need is you're going to use fruit juice organic fruit juice not juice from concentrate and the reason is because you want it to be really strong okay have a lot of taste what is this one this one is elder berry and I like to use a juice that has added health benefits and elderberry is very good for your immune system right then we have gelatin if you're vegan you can use agar agar flakes that is a sea vegetable is a wonderful option for a vegan or a vegetarian you have honey and then you have the vitamins that you're going to use you can customize use which are the vitamins you want today I'm using vitamin C powder you could do a be even a probiotic okay all right so that's it how do we make these well I actually made a few earlier so just let's roll in the tape oh look at those so what I did was I put the juice in a little saucepan like so then I sprinkled on the gelatin and here's the really fun part now is that I whisk the gelatin in and then I left it for a while to see it blue it blooms which means that it absorbs all of the liquid then I put it on the heat and it started to liquefy so you want it to break up and to completely liquefy then I'm adding some nice raw honey to it and then finally I'm putting in powdered vitamin C or vitamin C loading it up there and then whisk it again make sure there are no lumps in it spray really important to chocolate mold or a candy mold I use that doesn't stick right exactly then I used a turkey baster just to add it into the little candy molds and then I am going to let it set for just a couple of hours in the fridge and we are done and what we actually have here is the little set ones and you may try one if you like right there mark what if they don't come out of the mold so mark they do they do come out of the molds really do all right you can control the amount I have my determine C for the day you've got your vitamin C for the day work do what if you don't have one of these all right so if you don't have your moulds it's so easy you can just use a glass pyrex dish that you have at home I have pre-made some here in a little saucepan I am simply going to actually would you spray first this is very important as well not be able to get it out of the bowl see that does it come out of the mold Oh mark you're just so she's doing that will you and then in that goes like so and then you're going to leave that to set in the frigid air and when you are done here I'll take this over boom oh thank you mom another wave right here we have set one now hang on a minute what if it doesn't come out of the mold me what if it doesn't come out of the mold okay what do you like to cut it for you to cut it into little cubes hey drop some numbers over here what's this cost all right in the store it's upwards of 20 bucks for third for a month's supply for a month's supply $2 Wow this is why it makes sense save yourself a money go to pinterest.com for such a home and family TV you'll get the recipe and all the instructions

So big thanks to Simple Health\nfor their continued support and for sponsoring this video. Now, today, I'm gonna be making a recipe from The Vulgar Chef and it is for ranch-flavored gummy bears. Ranch-flavored gummy bears. Let that sink in for a minute. Ranch, you know, that white saucy stuff that everyone loves to dip their crudites or\ntheir carrot sticks in. That stuff. I'm talking about that stuff. And I'm talking about gummy bears and making a savory\nversion of gummy bears. Sounds interesting, right? Because I've never had a savory version of a gummy bear ever, and I've always wanted to make gummy bears way, way, way, way, way back, back when homemade\ngummy bears was a thing, I think that's probably about\nsix or seven years ago, now. I remember when the King\nof Random made gummy Legos. And I said, yes. Step back a little bit. Actually, a few years ago, I did make homemade Sour Patch Kids, which is kind of like a gummy, but I've never used a gummy\nbear mold or anything. So, of course I had to get\nmy mitts on a gummy mold and I picked up this one right here. So I was thinking, I might need a little bit of insurance for this particular recipe. 'Cause what if these gummy\nsnacks don't taste good? I mean, I've made plenty of\nthings that don't taste good, but here's another ranch-themed snack that I've always wanted\nto make, but never did. So, we'll just put it all together. We'll make it a two-for-one video today. So, let me..... The rest -- other.... (tape rewinding) The other recipe I wanna\nmake comes out of this book. It's from the Backs.... \"Back of the Box Gourmet\". I've made other recipes from this, but these are all recipes\nthat are on the back of boxes of famous things, like mock apple pie, which I've made by the way, I will put the link down below. What other things? No-bake chocolate cheesecake, which was on the back of the Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips. Lipton onion burger sandwich on the back of the Lipton soup thingies. This is the Hidden Valley\nRanch oyster crackers. So while my gummy bears are setting up, I'm gonna make a batch of crackers too, because I think those are\ngonna be stinking delicious. So if these don't turn out,\nat least I'll have crackers. Okay, let's make the gummy snacks first. So the first thing we need\nto do is bloom our gelatin. Basically blooming means\nto rehydrate the gelatin. I'm using two packets of Knox\nunflavored plain gelatin. So we're just gonna take one\nthird of a cup of milk -- the Vulgar Chef uses a dry measuring cup, so that's what I'm gonna use -- two packets of gelatin; and sprinkle that right over the top. One, two. Kind of a cool thing happens\nwhen we have gelatin blooming. It kind of gets all\nwrinkly and shriveled up and it looks kind of, brain-like. Kind of like the surface of\nlike brain coral or something. It's kind of great. So this is gonna take about five minutes. So I'm gonna let it to do its thing and I'll be right back. So out of convenience, I'm using my little\nItaki Shabuki pot here. You could definitely use a sauce pan and do this right over\nthe stove, easy peasy. Or even in a microwave safe\ndish and just nuke this. Alrighty. So while we're waiting for the\ngelatin to bloom in the milk, why don't we prep our crackers? You're going to need\na bag oyster crackers. Now these are just like\nsaltines or a plain cracker seasoned with a bit of\nsalt and they're delicious. And, actually, I think, pretty\nessential to clam chowder. So you can find them\neverywhere here in New England, not surprisingly. So we're gonna need one\nbag of oyster crackers. The recipe calls for a 12 or 16 ounce bag. I have a nine ounce bag. So I'm gonna scale back the\nrecipe just a little bit. I have noticed just the other\nday we bought graham crackers for S'mores and my crackers\nwere significantly smaller. Have you noticed this? I'm not a huge graham cracker eater, but I noticed that when I\nsnapped the crackers in half, they didn't make squares,\nthey were rectangles. I remember taking graham crackers -- if you follow me on Instagram, you know I already talked about this in my story. I apologize for being redundant, but I really feel like\nthis needs to be shared. So the box looks the same\nin terms of packaging size, but when you open it, there is a gap between\nthe stack of crackers and the side walls of the box. So the crackers are significantly smaller. And my theory is that they\nkeep the prices the same, but you're getting fewer,\nless amount of cracker. I don't know. I've also noticed this on\nAnimal Crackers as well. They're smaller. I know that I've grown since I was, you know, five, when I was\neating animal crackers, but they're definitely\nsmaller than they used to be. Okay. So I think that's what's happening here with the oyster crackers. This book was written several years ago, back when oyster crackers\nwere in 12 or 16 ounce bags rather than nine ounce. Okay, enough of that. Dump 'em in. Two thirds of a cup of oil. Okay. Oil. We're gonna add one package of Hidden Valley Ranch\nseasoning, dump that in. Did you know the third\ningredient listed on Hidden Valley Ranch is monosodium\nglutamate known as MSG, which makes everything\ntaste more delicious? The more, you know. Deliciousness. That's why it's so\ndelicious, I'm telling you. MSG. I am not a huge consumer\nof ranch dressing, but when it's around, I like it. Quarter teaspoon, lemon pepper. Dill. Always reminds me of pickles. Dill. Half teaspoon of dill weed. I like how they call it dill weed. Boomp. Garlic powder. Boom, boom. Gonna mix-y mix-y that all up. Now, we're gonna pour\nall this deliciousness right on top of these. Oh boy. Get all of that in there. Now we're gonna toss to coat. This is like a bath. It's actually kind of\npooling at the bottom here. Okay, I'm going to have one straight up 'cause I can't handle this. Oh yeah. They're gonna be good. Yum yum, yeah. Hey, come back here. Okay. Get all of that in there. You will not escape. Now it says to bake these in a warm oven. Which I guess it's probably\nless than 200 degrees? 200 degrees? Guess whatever is the lowest\ntemperature on your oven. I'm gonna be using my\nhandy dandy toaster oven. Put them in a single layer. (crackers tapping) Spread that around. Now, place these in a warm\noven for 15 to 20 minutes. \u266a Do do, do do \u266a Our gelatin is pretty much all firmed up. There's still some dry gelatin on top. I'm gonna use this and\nkind of stir this up to get all that gelatin\nin contact with the water. I'm gonna close my window now because there's a neighbor vacuuming and it's kind of annoying. Can't go that way. Oh, I'm smellin' crackers. (whistles) Check on your crackers\n'cause they're gonna toast like lickety-splitness. Whenever you smell anything\ntoastin' it's probably toastin'. So, those look amazing. So I went ahead and\nturned off my toaster oven because it was getting\na little bit too frisky. Now we're going to make the gummy bears. Heat this up. Oop, see, it's already beginning to melt. And we want to heat this fully, so that all the gelatin melts entirely. It's happening quickly. Nice. Let me go in with my silicone scraper. Try to work out any lumpage here. Technical term, lumpage. Now we're going to add one\npacket of ranch dressing. Okay. That's looking a lot like ranch. Use some vegetable oil\nand give it a little bit of oil in here. My little gummy maker\ncame with this eyedropper. I'm gonna use that to\nsuck some of this up. Nice. Eyedropper of ranch gelatin. So we get some bears in there. Don't forget the lions. Let's get some monkeys too. Let's make some penguins too. Boo boo, boo boo boop. And let us not forget the gummy worm. So one batch of that\nmixture is enough to make one tray of gummies. I'm going to place this\nin the refrigerator. So let's snack on our\nwarm crackers, shall we? Look, those look beautiful. Hidden Valley Ranch oyster crackers. Itadakimasu! Pretty tasty. Mhmm. They could be a ranchy-er though. Honestly. The addition of the oil\nmakes them extra crispy. They're kind of light and airy and fluffy without tasting greasy or feeling greasy. So the recipe measurements include kind of a range of measurements. So I erred on the side\nof the lesser amounts because my bag of crackers was smaller. I would say if you make this, go full on and do the large amounts, even for the nine ounce bag of crackers. 'Cause I think these could\nuse even more seasoning. They're pretty good. In fact, I'm going to add some\nleftover ranchy powder and put that right on top. Now we have a more intense\nbuttermilk ranch flavor to them. (cracker crunching) Mm-hm. And it kind of coats your fingers, so you get that kind of\nCheeto, Dorito, experience 'cause you know, you\nget the powdery stuff. Yeah. That's what you do, people. Okay, delicious. How many have I eaten now? Like 20? Okay, girl needs to stop. It has been over an hour now since I put the gummies\nin the refrigerator and they should now be set. Let's go grab 'em. (Emmy vocalizes) Oh yes. Oh yes. Look at this. Silicone molds, man. I'm just gonna push them out. Boom. So easy and so satisfying\nand look at the detail. Oh, you gotta see this. Boom. Boom. Boom. And look how detailed. Oh my gosh. The monkeys are so cute. Boop. Yep, penguin's cute. Oh yeah, look at the gummy worm. (Emmy imitates spring boinging) Ranch-flavored homemade gummies. Itadakimasu! Mm. Wow. Those are strong. They have kind of a different\ntexture than gummies, though. They're bouncy. And I don't taste any\nof the gelatin, though. That's a bit of an aside, but, they are full of ranch flavor. They're actually very intensely\nflavored, pretty salty. Nice kind of buttermilk tang to them. The texture is a little bit different than a regular gummy bear too. They're not quite as soft. They're bouncy and chewy, but they don't have that\nkind of slightly tenderness and like, elasticity. I think that's what's really missing. There's not kind of a stretch. There's a bounce like\na rubber band bounce, but there's not this kind of nice little bouncy stretch to them. It's more just like ning, ning, ning, ning rather than that, heh. I've read in another recipe that sorbitol is what they put in regular\ngummy bears to give them that chewy softness. I think that's probably what these need. So final thoughts, are these good? They're fine. If you are a total ranch\nnut, you will love these, because they just taste\nlike ranch dressing. But they're in the shape\nof, of gummy animals. I think it's something\nabout that combination of gummy texture and that\nchallenge to your expectations of what gummies should be that makes this kind of\nan unpleasant experience. It's not disgusting. It's just terribly unexpected. Alrighty. So they have it. Ranch-flavored gummies and\nranch-flavored oyster crackers. Thanks so much for joining me.

(light bouncy music) Superhero power!", "7jwhRRmSfS0": "hi friends welcome again to my channel today we are making the Warner for your kids most favorite favorite snack it's called the fruit snack right how many of your so alarmed I was because any time there was that talk about the fruit snack in the store I always run away from it because they have gelatin they have too much of artificial colors flavors and preservatives and my kids cannot handle red for two your blue one those are like major neurotoxins for them so I always have run away from that but my very good friend Athena one time told me that hey you can make it at home too without all those bad bad stuff so I looked at some of the ingredients and I tried a few of them myself and of course this is not my original recipe because this has been here for years and years and years right so it is how you make toasting the bread right so you cannot just invent that you just discover that how it was there now I found it right and I am super excited to share it with you with many flavors and yes it does have a beautiful natural color to it and with very less than Trinian's and that is the magic of my channel everything has fast quick easy at very very simple now let's get started with our ingredients I like over here I have all kinds of mixed berries over here I have a strawberry a little different that is just for the color okay I have this promise it is a red color and I have the black baby and I think it's the ice organic black transfer unit paint over clear there is the organic blue there is frozen and I highly recommend to use the natural non-frozen introspective because it's winter season okay and we don't get to their natural blueberries they do get rotten breathing faster so if I you don't have time to buy is the regular or have blueberries or muffins or even strawberries and you're worried that you just kind of go rocket in your fridge because it of the time conception so you can definitely go ahead and buy these pearls and pennies or frozen fruits and the next engineering they use is called the Oh God this is the further the gelling of our dump it's an on gelatin for vegan lovers you know we're here the next thing we need is the mold and before I forget there is honey this is localized honey but this is completely optional if you are watching your sugar you don't have to do this you can skip this ingredient and this is the beautiful cute little gummy mold that I got from Amazon I think it came in a pack of five for like just nine dollars and this is really what the guys because and you can make it at any time all you need is a freezer and all these ingredients pretty much date right okay let's get started the next step is I would go ahead and use my jointer and I'm going to blend all of these separate and this will take one cup of strawberry one cup of blueberry and one cup of black tea and going to blend them separate so we can start over from blackboard them beautifully into these glass balls I'm just going to use like a half cup of each I said one cup but then it is going to be like a small serving because I tend to make it fresh every week so that way it stays fresh and it is healthy as well so over here that's what I have I'm going to go use my Vitamix over here and I'm just going show blender and before that I'm going to defrost all of these and then I'm going to blend up and just make it a puree and I'll be back I have made blueberry puree or your strawberry and the blackberry and they come in beautiful colors over here it looks like a purple pink and this is like a dark cherry pink over here these are pretty good and I have my time ready I'm gonna start making our BlackBerry first and we are going to do the same procedure for all of that so the first one I'm going to add money and from then on I'm not going to add and for these two because I'm making fun of my diabetes clients as well so let's say I'm just going to go ahead and pour it in okay I have poured the whole thing in what I have done is I have gone ahead and added more water to this so it forms like a nicer gravy here there are two ways to make this you can either strain it or you can do it without straining it either way it is cool I like the rough edges over here so I don't a strain this and now I'm going to add our honey this is like a tablespoon of honey and I'm going to mix it in for that to blend it well by the way my stove is on a low flame right now just for a 1-minute process now let's go ahead and add our got powder this is by the way we get non gelatinized so I'm just going to add 1/2 tablespoon of that this one actually comes with a molded dropper but I don't know where I put it today so I'm going to use a regular dropper so my style is switched off at this point and if you said it's still like a very thin gravy here back to with the auger you have to pour it right away into our bowls because it gets thick pretty fast once it gets thick it's very hard to work with right okay now let's get started let me go ahead and take this dropper I'm going to take it away from the stout as you can see it has thickened up already okay just have to pour yeah until the edges you don't want to over call them then in that case it is going to come out very ugly so if you made a mess we can all these wipe it so don't worry about that okay let's say that you don't have a dropper you can use a small Metallica measuring spoon that I have I'm using right now you can use something like that too and make sure you fill it the moles and I know that I have made a mess over here because of the spoon idea but I just wanted to show you guys in case you don't have a proper it shouldn't stop you from making these wonderful gummies and we still have so much left or so I'm just going to go ahead and wipe it clean okay it's done I forgot to do one important step over here so what you have to do is he happy to send tray like this so when you pass it on to your freezer you know it doesn't get flip-flop on that but now that it is a little dry so I kind of saved my boat okay my Starwood on medium heat right now and I'm going to pour these strawberry fury here just the same thing we made the other finger now I'm going to slowly stir it in and let it sit for like 30 seconds before we add the car since I am I am making it for our diabetic patients I am NOT going to add sugar or any kind of natural sweetener or even honey to these recipes it's just two ingredients there one is the puree and the other all right it is a little warm right now and I'm just going to add our agar the same thing just two tablespoons and then acetate is very nicely without any lumps okay spin one minute I'm going to turn off my style in just one minute now once you see the bubbles of the rolling boil and we just have to stop the heat and then I'm moving it aside and now I have two of these molds and I'm just going to make sure I put it into the blue mold so it has a different color combination okay I am going to use a filler like this you know the medicine of filler so it is easy to use it so I'm just going to go ahead and eat them and then as you can see it is a very less mess compared to the other two we had propyl is a great idea but I already show to people who don't have it and they want to do it right away so the filler is a great idea see how much mess free there is compared to our last one yeah the one tip that I would definitely tell you guys is do it ASAP do not let it sit for like five minutes or ten minutes because if you'll get gelatinized - very soon and it was very hard to work with because it would make a huge mess I mean it will stick to everywhere and it will not form a good shape like we have I here you can also buy a big gummy bear mold I like the smaller one so we don't overheat ourselves so this is good in for kids who don't like to eat through see during the winter season we need a lot of antioxidants due to infections and other stuff so it's better to keep them very keen eyes you know that means lots of berries and this is the only way and I had a lot of smoothies in my recipes where you can just try all of that for your kids who are really picky eaters and who don't like the fruit idea and let's make it fun for them so we both win in the kitchen right alright it is done I'm just going to shape them a little bit just weaker oh here and there remove the extra residue here now we are going to do the blackening same procedure one cup of blackberry puree and I'm just going to warm it for like a twenty or thirty seconds in once it is mom we're going to go ahead and add the other dark powder I'm going to reduce the heat looks like it's too hot okay now it is a little more I'm just going to go in and you can have it two tablespoon of agar powder - 1 cup since it is less than 1 cup I'm only going to add 1 tablespoon of this and I'm gonna mix it very well as usual without any lumps and I have my filler here and we're use a spoon as well as you can see the vapor it is all warmed up a little bit of heart and we'll see the rolling boil and all these bubbles now is the time to set it aside and start filling it in ok here we go I have filled it in and there are little smudges here and there but that's ok good black blackberries over here and I love these different Andre of color so first we have this blue berry which is like a it looks like a pinkish dark nitish color over here is like a rose pink kind of strawberry and the last thing is that the blackberry does look extremely black now it's getting ready to go into my freezer for 20 to 30 minutes but if you want to or refrigerate it rather than the freezing idea put it again inside the fridge for 1 hour to one and a half hours depending on the consistency that you need and once it is out of the freezer I will come back and I will show you how it is done alright now what do we do with the rest of the gravy that we made like this so I just come in all three Puri I'm just going to take a bowl like this big and I'm just going to try a jello form over here so I have a tray as you can see the bottom just gonna pour it in this is pretty easy because it's a big spout here a big mold now let's see how it comes make sure you don't overflow that like I'm doing it right now just try to peace love definitely freeze they do not refrigerate it because this is going to be hard to work with alright and a filter of all things of make sure you go a little slower I better if I saw it just overfilled some of those better overall it looks pretty good I'm just going to go and freeze it for twenty to thirty minutes so because of with a large quantity may take a little longer but let's see how long it takes an IO Lucchino alright I have filled of all things over make sure you go a little slow or I reckon fast so it just overfills some of those better overall it looks pretty good I'm just going to go and freeze it for twenty to thirty minutes because of with a large quantity may take a little longer but let's see how long it takes an IO Lucchino alright I'm super excited it's been thirty minutes I just waited for another ten minutes for them to get a really hot end so I have started peeling off some of them and it loves some weather it's so cute cute Oh fellas I'm just going to go ahead and remove them and put it in three different cups for you guys to see and I'll be back alright here we go I have separated them into three different flavors so here we go we have the blueberry eat look a little cherry color because of the guitar and over here is the blackberry and over here is the strawberry and it's going to show how cute they are so in these pads is 50 per pad so usually it comes in a pack or five 499 from Amazon like I mentioned before impact our here everything that we have 50 of them it doesn't look that bigger because of this small texture of the gummy bear but it is a small mold sturla you know it is very healthy so video keeps healthy happy and delicious neck taking some over here and it is very easy to take it out I have left it out for two to three hours probably as you can see there is simplicity over here you can keep it for like overnight but I just wanted to see how it's done it is really really delicious I tried a little bit myself this is the fruit jello you know they're left over after Puri from our coming ears over here and I'm just going to move it up do you here we go all right guys here we go our fruit jello with the leftover fruit puree is ready and today we made three types of coming days fruit snacks and leftover fruit jello here we go very cute huh okay so what you have to do next is you have to keep it in the fridge if you're gonna eat it for later you can box it in a mason jar will be a great idea if you want to travel with this and you take it in a freezer bag and so it'll still stay so the same consistency same texture if you liked

saucepan over medium-high heat we're gonna go ahead and add in two cups of our fruit juice then we're gonna add four tablespoons of our sugar and then we're gonna add six packages of our unflavored gelatin now we're doing this on a medium heat medium-high heat and we're just gonna stir this until all of our gelatin and sugar dissolve [Music] which would be fairly fairly quick oh yeah so we have Mars mixed up we're gonna let it sit on our heat for one minute and then we're gonna go ahead and pull it off of there I'll bring you back alright y'all so now we have a liquid measuring cup and we're just gonna take our candy mixture and pour that into our measuring cup now an F now an FYI you may want to get your saucepan into some water to soak fairly quickly now that we have our mixture pour it into a cup let's go ahead and get our molds alright y'all so we have our mold so we have some dinosaurs we got some bees so we got some fruits these are just some silicone molds I picked them up at Walmart for 50 cents apiece so now we're just gonna carefully take and pour just a little bit into each of our molds oops it may be a little messy FYI so you know what I'm gonna go ahead get these poured and I'll bring you back all right y'all something I forgot to mention is I used a I didn't put a cookie sheet under my trays my bulbs because I knew there would be spillage so now you're also noticing that I got some empty mold still that's because I'm gonna go ahead and whip up some apple mixture as well and I'll mix those up and I'll bring you back all right y'all so now we've got all of our candy molds poured we're gonna go ahead and let these sit on the counter for about ten minutes until the to the top start to set all right y'all so we've let these sit for a while the tops are being in the scent all we're gonna do now is go ahead and throw these in the fridge for two hours all right yeah so our gummies have been in the fridge for a few hours they should be set up still set up now I'm going to go ahead and pop all these out of the trays and it's just simple silicone so all we'll have to do is push on the back but this is gonna require two hands and I don't have my cameraman here today so I'm gonna pop all these out I'll bring you back oh yeah and there you have your jelly candies I think here we have oh my god we got a grape we got a great B we got another

you can also use fresh fruit if you like as well now if you enjoy these type of recipes please take a moment to like and subscribe to our youtube channel we would really appreciate it and it is free so when we're done we've got our pot here on the stove to that we're going to make a cherry flavor today we're going to put 3 4 cup of tart cherry juice 1 4 cup of fresh lime juice and we've got two tablespoons of fresh honey i shouldn't say fresh but it's locally grown so we're locally gotten so that's just going to give us a little bit of sweetness make it not so tart we're going to turn our heat to medium and we're going to cook this until it's hot not boiling but just hot we just want it to get hot not to the boiling stage yet give that a nice stir and this should just take just a few minutes all right it's beginning to steam we're now going to turn our that took about three minutes or so we're going to turn our heat down to low as you're going to hear our dog gracie yes found something outside that's attractive probably a bird or something we're going to slowly add to that three tablespoons of gelatin and we want to add it to it slowly because we don't want it to um lump together any place all right we're gonna finish putting this in and then we're gonna let it simmer for roughly 10 minutes all right we're putting the last of our gelatin in i can't remember if i told you or not how much we're actually using three tablespoons and the 10 minutes are you going to use it's going to take about 10 minutes for you to slowly dissolve that in there and pour it in again it's so that way you don't have any lumps all right we're going to take a moment that looks like it's all dissolved now we're going to turn the heat off and we'll move over to our molds now we got these cute little uh gummy bear molds off amazon i think they cost like eight dollars if you don't have these what you can do is you can actually take a sheet pan or you can take a cake pan oil it just a little bit you can just like pour it out chill it and then you can cut it into little squares if you want what we're going to do is we've got these nice little thingy these came with this nice little one these little uh fillers take this as i make a mess which i'm really good at as you know by now and slowly fill each of these up one at a time we're going to finish filling these up and then we're going to stick on the refrigerator for one to two hours until they're completely firm all right we pulled our gummy bears out of the refrigerator after they have chilled for just a little while now we're going to take them as easily as flipping them out and they all pull out one by one just press it on the other side of your mold and they pop right out this is a great way of making some delicious homemade snacks they're going to be much healthier than if you would buy them at the store so it's healthy candy we hope you that you enjoy these recipes you", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching

"okay welcome to mealtime Monday today we are making homemade fresh fruit gummy snacks you welcome the ingredients that you'll need for this recipe are strawberries orange lemon juice lime juice some gelatin and a packet of stevia or sweetener of your choice you'll also need some sort of tray to pour the mixture in at the end and some sort of small cookie cutter this is the smallest that I have but you can get really tiny bear shaped cookie cutters in the craft section or the clay section of the craft section of any hobby store but I'm just using the star shape from my little pepper seasoned cookie cutter set the first step is to juice all the citrus and combine all of it into a bowl next I diced up my strawberries didn't have enough strawberry so I went ahead and tossed it in a package of raspberries too but that is not in the original recipe so I'm putting those in a pot and adding the citrus juice and I'm going to bring those to a boil once it comes to a boil I'm going to turn the heat down to medium and let the fruit simmer until it is super soft now I have moved the fruit mixture into my blender I'm going to add my packet of stevia and blend until smooth hello it smells so good so now we're just gonna let it sit and cool before adding the gelatin okay it is set and cooled for a little while and now I'm an advocate inand I actually have one packet left for the recipe calls for so I hope that these turn out but Aidan and I have already given this a taste and it is delicious so even if they don't solidify enough they're still going to be delicious if you are vegan or don't eat gelatin I believe they sell a product called fruit pectin that you could use in the place so I think that's what it's called if I'm wrong and you know what I'm trying to talk about then you can just comment below so now I'm just gonna blend this what's wrong what's over there yeah how you helped the mama prep the butternut squash for dinner thank you you're doing an excellent job so now I'm just gonna going back there are you yelling at me over the Vitamix you want some water what do you want it the strawberry leaf mm-hmm I'll take it Thanks and now I'm just going to pour this into my pan and spread it around evenly yeah it's hot what you're like who do you tell me about where we going mommy's making you some fruit snacks you want to eat them now yeah but they got a cool and then we gotta cut them okay can you help mommy cut him okay thank you the lime he's in line 9 bye-bye mr. lime now we've moved it to a refrigerator where it will sit until it solidifies as always if you want to know the exact amounts of everything that we use here just click the link to the recipe in the description box and it will take you to the original recipe where you can pin it or

fresh fruit gummies and then this is what the parents eat as always if you give this a try let us know what you think bye", "AgJ_1UQlC3U": "[Music] my name is Liz this is the first time you're joining if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribes ORS many more videos in my library there and many more to come in the future and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much again for a cup for watching I really appreciate your support well thanks again for coming topping buy diamonds like animals have a great day [Music]", "nFHpiBPmCns": "[Music] today I'm showing you how to make Prosecco gummy bears I'm gonna use regular Prosecco and then this pink Prosecco so that I'll have two different color gummy bears but regardless of color whether it's champagne Prosecco or cava the recipe is the same in a pot combine 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar and 25 grams of sugar get the pot on medium heat and bring the mixture up to a boil for one to two minutes agar needs to boil in order to gel properly so make sure it hits a rolling boil for at least a minute pull the mixture off the heat and at this point I like to transfer it to a smaller bowl to prevent it from cooling down too quickly next you'll need some gummy bear molds I just got these on Amazon they were really affordable and easy to find and place these molds onto a sheet pan this just makes them easier to move later then use a dropper this one actually came with the molds to stream the Prosecco mixture into the little gummy bear cavities [Music] place the gummy bears in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until firm oh now I'm just gonna repeat this whole process with the regular Prosecco so again 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar agar and 25 grams of sugar bring it all up to a boil for one to two minutes transfer to a small container and use a dropper to fill the gummy bear molds while I'm doing that I'd just like to take a minute to thank living gin for sponsoring today's video by using their egg our agar in this recipe we're able to keep these gummy bears which are traditionally full of gelatin completely plant-based if you're looking to replace gelatin and any of your recipes or are wanting to try out these Prosecco gummy bears check out the link in the description box below for where you can purchase the living gin agar agar that I'm using here there are also a bunch of recipes on their website as well as on their Instagram both of which I'll also link to and if you're feeling competitive and are interested in getting your recipes featured by them they recently started holding monthly vegan recipe contests where people vote for their favorite recipe so if you want to submit a recipe or you just want to go have a look at the submissions and vote then definitely head over to their website once the gummy bears are set up you can pop them out of the molds and serve one thing to keep in mind is that the texture of these gummy bears is a little bit less chewy than gelatin based gummies what I found helps to get that texture is just to leave these out to dry a little bit overnight on a wire rack something about dehydrating them a bit gives them that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] [Music] thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video and if you like this recipe and want to see more content like this and such as subscribing and feel free to connect with me elsewhere at chef studio underscore you", "Vp3EMJXJyBc": "welcome to spiced candies you recently have a channel announcement and only two guys replied and asked for gummy bears so we're doing something I haven't done in the past I think three years or two years and that is a gummy bear recipe that is something I developed it is totally sugar free meaning added sugar free I'll be using this jam and this Jam is absolutely sugar free it's made only for 100% fruits there are no sugar additives no sugar replacements no sugar in there just fruit and this is it turd dark very rich but it is supposed to be strawberry it's not really strawberry you can feel the other fruits there because there let me get the ingredients there for a second it says 50% strawberry and if you guys would like to read here he goes 50% strawberry it has apple juice concentrate that has pectin in it it does have some lemon juice and SABIC juice and that's about it so it's sugar content is 35% but that's fruit based so it's coming from the fruit nothing else so there it goes our Jam yes I'm gelatin here and as usual if you want the recipe just email me I'll be happy to share now you used to have a nice beaker to pour a finish gummy bear confection into molds and they have some molds here have some gummy bear molds and blue and I have some shell molds so that broke so I don't have it we'll be using this thing and I hope I'm going to make it pouring something out of it but here we go let's get started so basically what we need is the jam let's get things out of the way here and focused right so we need the jam we need a tablespoon of water I managed to get it here without a spill and we're going to mix it in always reminds me baby food doesn't it right below tell me what you think I'm breaking it down and the good mentioned it does have picton in it that that's because there's Apple concentrate and that thing and that holes do have a lot of pectin in them now that's it that's nice we'll add the gelatin and I'll just leave it be we can actually mix it and if you like or it just gonna let it be to suck up the moisture that's what we had to add the water there we go I love thee for 10 minutes the gelatin needs to blossom I think the term is basically needs the suck-up Thor and tight late and then we'll do what we need to do this is by the way an off topic peak and you have the recipe on on my previous videos these are orange peels candied orange peels now this is a one point one kilogram batch around two pounds worth so I'm giving it 10 days wife likes these coated with dark chocolate and the kids like these as is no more than 10 days and is going to be gone literally and of course BRB brings them to friends and then get them to work so so I'm going to manage and we're not going to eat all that alone so don't worry about it so I just wanted to show you what I'm doing in the meantime let's get back to gummy bears more interesting 10 minutes have passed and by the way if you're in a hurry and you fear doing other things that's fine you can leave it for more now be sure the difference it's like hitting rubber I'm finally trying to it's not going to you can see it's not penetrating it's really rubbery so we're get to go I'll pop this into the microwave for 2030 seconds and I'll be back okay 20 seconds did it you can see it's fully liquid now it's ready to go it is a bit taut you can see the steam it's not really steam because it's temperature here is 45 to 55 degrees Celsius for you now I'm at say 50 degrees Celsius so it's a bit hot but it's okay it's a good temperature to work at let's get set up over here I'm going to use this mold I dropped something over there it is clean get some water marks for my last wash let's get going let's see how it can be accurate this thing here okay one done think we do it I'll put this is the fridge it will cool off and I'll show you the results in a minute well I didn't give them too much time to set because it's already near midnight tomorrow's day like any other day work so five minutes in the fridge and this has set up more or less okay still a bit too pliable but definitely edible and definitely workable so I'll let it be in the fridge for some more time and basically I'm done now if you want to put these in a can or a drawer or any sort I recommend you put a little bit of oil any oil will do but sunflower oil would be best canola oil would work just as well the whole point is that you're using an oil that doesn't have a flavor of its own so Kofi's and will prevent them from sticking to each other because they're really really sticky sticky but also stretchy and this is really a nice texture I like it and the fiber is well basically it's a jam flavor whatever Jam you choose that's going to eat the flavor so that's it hope you enjoyed and I'll see you soon have a sweet day", "RIMPb0wXPfM": "this is one gonna be there this is ten coming back and this is 1000 gummy bear oh no we loved one ooh 1000 mm mmm they smell good I feel like there are a lot more lollipops then gummy bears I think it looks a bit bigger now this looks like a thousand gummy and just kidding it's a camera trick and today we're gonna be mixing 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear hey guys it's wengie and gummy bear hugs today is another epic DIY day we are mixing 10,000 gummy bear and instead of making a giant gummy bear I'm gonna make a giant wee bit it's not really like a bear bear he's a panda bear that you know looks quite delicious because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two kinds of bags in this pie of 160 grams and holds approximately 70 gummies accounted this multi bag holds 90 gummies and it's 200 grams we have sixty five bags of dish with brings up a total of ten thousand four hundred gummies are you gonna do that no I already ate it you ain't 400 oh no no no maybe like 200 300 small packs are pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do subscribe or I will do few lucky cooker you wanna try coming there anything is this friend no it's weird uh-huh you prefer the camera Oh No okay I'm out ah he's out too Haley's cats don't let go me oh you know what I need coffee okay finally [Applause] I just realized I have a gummy bear planned decoration because I just green light give me a thumbs up guys thank me for my efforts [Music] alright guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he

subscribing yet hit the button down here we need more friends and we like where you're at today we are going to grill gummy bears now gummy bears are interesting to work with so a big gummy bear farmer like a lot is hair bow they do a really good job the thing is with their gummy bears though is they are kind of tiny because we're not sure really what they feed them but they don't use anything no steroids with their gummy bears so sometimes you can roast them on a skewer like this which we like but we also like to get the giant gummy bears now we went to a private farm we know because these gummy bears work better on your grill when it's really hot the bigger the plumper they are so get your gummy bear all set get your good knife out like our shoen ito here and you gotta saw through these guys because they're thick and strong but gummy bears man when it's done right it's gonna cook perfectly through nah psych we ain't grilling gummy bear gummy bears y'all what we are doing today is making a gummy bear sangria now this drink is sweet tasty not too over the top but it sets parties off so if you want to make this drink make sure you're planning on having fun at your party if you're the person just sits there and chills and just wants to be affected that you're somewhere this ain't for you but it is for us so let's get started what you want to do first right is what we do the night before the party we have a pitcher and you're going to take a bottle of a semi-dry white you don't want to be too sweet with it right you can use a semi-dry riesling something like that but don't be too sweet because we're going to sweeten this thing up with the beautiful gummy bears the fruit everything else that we're going to roll with so we've got our wine in there bottle of wine and what we're going to add our girl malaya on food network she's the one that we are cribbing from for this recipe and she's super dope check out her show check out her blog what she uses is a little bit different variation of fruit but our fruit is we're using half of a bartlett pear half of an empire apple because we from the empire state reppin the qs syracuse clothing company and we also have a granny smith apple too and then we have five cherries that we've pitted and cut in half so we got our fruit in here we got our wine in here so we're going the right direction the next thing we're going to do is here we got again from the mighty empire state some mayor brothers apple juice do one cup of apple juice in here now at this point this is ready to go in the fridge leave it in there overnight it'll gain some color we'll come back to that the next thing now is getting our gummy bears ready so here's the deal and these are the measurements if you can um we're a little we're going a little balls deep on these jars here the ball the depth on the whoa we'll be perverted we're talking about jars here man and the depth of the jar so what you want is a cup and a half of gummy bears if you go just above the word ball on the jar that's your depth right that's going to give you a cup and a half of these beautiful gummy bears and they are they do a really great job growing bears are great for everything my partner alex dressed up as one for halloween one year his wife loved it so now we're at that point the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add some vodka because we are going to booze it up we want to be bougie boozy we want to drop it right you know what i'm saying so the same thing a cup and a half of vodka we're using tito's because tito's is clean doesn't bring a lot of different flavors into the mixture but it rather takes them out so get yourself a good cup and a half of vodka covered gummy bears now by themselves these babies can dance if you know what i'm saying but what you want to do this either eight hours before the party or the night before set it aside it's got beautiful colors too so it looks cool try to keep it out of direct sunlight and then you've got this stuff set up now we did this the night before because we knew we were gonna run hard at it today here is a pitcher that we made the night before with all the ingredients the next step we've got is here's our jar of gummy bears and vodka what happens with this is you're going to see the radical difference in colors because a lot of the gummy bear sugar and the flavor has peeled off into the vodka so you're going to strain a lot of the vodka in there right we don't want to put the gummy bears in there save these though so i got to tell you my partner once got me through a country music concert i don't want to go to but i went we had a blast and i think part of the reasons because we were eating tequila soaked gummy bears and that worked out so now we're ready to go give it a little bit of a stir in here get all these flavors that are just like ready to party ready for the party get that all set we like a big old pint glass pour your sangria gummy bear sangria in there hobby garnish it is actually one of the skewers with a bunch of gummy bears on it gummy bear sangria coming to a party near you you", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "yE1tfxkWy0g": "hello it's gina and tiffany with standing promises and we are we have test drove a couple different flavors of peeps we've had chocolate fudge chocolate hot chocolate hot chocolate oh chocolate pudding chocolate pudding yes and the hot tamales peeps tonight okay and here's the deal i'm sad i'm super sad because when we first we should have got all the flavors when we saw them all they had like eight different flavors now they're down to three and we got the third one so unfortunately this will be our last taste test this is our last peeps she doesn't like peeps anyway so therefore she doesn't count on the flavor or taste but anyway the hot tamale ones were amazing the chocolate pudding ones they were they tasted like chocolate but i wasn't a fan so tonight we're having fruit punch which i love fruit punch but i make s'mores out of teeth i would eat them s'mores on peeps perhaps okay look they kind of look like the hot tamale peeps oh and they smell oh because you can't smell okay anyway i'm gonna get it lily wonka it's really late and i've had a i've had a busy day here you go these are all soft i think that should never be consumed yes all right here we go taste test challenge third one this will be our last one i'm sorry we'll have to try to find something else to eat it smells like kool-aid yeah it kind of it kind of smells like it's the fruit punch yeah it smells like a packet of kool-aid yup okay here we go ready one two three okay i have made jello before and this tastes like when i lick the spoon of mixing like cherry or strawberry jello [Music] it tastes like yeah like kool-aid it tastes like if you put kool-aid in cool whip yeah i think cut it up it's like when you mix the kool-aid with the sugar and then you lick off the spoon that's what it kind of tastes like and you're doing it again yeah it's good i like it i mean this is left of mine and yeah look and look it's like tiffany's opinion doesn't really count because she doesn't like peeps at all anyway so but oh where are oh i didn't even bring the cadbury eggs over oh my word yes cadbury eggs to the cadbury franchise mini yes they have the little mini eggs that are like kind of like made like an m m they got the hard crunchy shell and then oh so good anyway way better as far as the fruit punch i'll give it one thumb up it's okay the texture of the fruit punch peeps is not the same as the texture of regular no it's very soft um usually they're like you can't really pull the from the marshmallow but that one is really soft it's good i like it it's okay but i do one thumb up on those by far of the three we tried hot tamales wins my vote but anyway so there's our taste test tonight fruit punch peeps one star yes and i saw there was a meme that i got tagged in the other day that said the way to eat peeps is to throw them let's do that and that's where these will be going next but anyway so yeah not a fan of the chocolate ones for sure fruit punch was okay hot tamales was awesome so that's my vote on the three anyway my opinion in any candy is just leave it the way that it is yeah don't try to change it don't try to change it yeah if you're gonna eat a peep just eat i don't know why you eat the sugary ones just eat the regular ones don't mess with the flavor and try to make it all hip and cool yeah exactly peeps will never be cool all right guys thanks for listening go try your peeps bye but not these bye", "n8-VIBJAf6o": "[Music] aloha mai kakou my name is Ralph and welcome to my kitchen where I like to share on my favorite Island and Hawaiian style recipes and today I've got a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please

notes recording yeah what's up y'all lamellae suave I'm here with my boy you liberated behind the camera what we're gonna do today is we're gonna make collect numbers i'ma show y'all how to make gummy bears and then the best in the world alright alright so we got bags and swingin me this is one of the stuff you need okay we're gonna start out we're gonna bring you guys with this and I'll show you what you need to get we go going down rexrode so right here if you ever come here at night know you want some you need a girlfriend I have a night out where those cars are over there that area over there just just make sure you come at night yeah bushes right there's a spot all you need is cool it the mix the powder water a spoon and the thing on sugar sugar did they think the container that I also forgot the gummy bears of course and you could also make kool-aid you can use the worms too so it doesn't really matter is whatever prefer but people like the gummy bears more because it soaks up the kool-aid better hey should I be like a superhero oh yeah party spider-man turtleman oh cool all right I always get this tropical punch you can the other one but this is the best this is on the best one she's dead since I'm not making a lot I'm just showing it from the video I'm gonna probably at small pad well you always want to get down especially we gonna make a lot should we get ya some replies huge mango oh my get this for summer of last name isn't it a min summer all right you guys are gonna want it have to get these okay any other better horrible you cannot get cuz the harbor how they make you the flavor or something there's something but I don't know what it does but it doesn't taste good the kool-aid this is a vacuum with this or this and then the gummy gummy worms I'm know what they're after it's like a bag like this it's like that same brand it ain't great value so all there is all you need is this this water and sugar and then the container and the spoon to mix messy all right let's go first thing you want to do before you start this you gotta wash your hands higher I mean I'm not really well you kind of touching stuff so you want your hands dirty don't put every like all you're gonna make at once want to like to like that's like three handfuls or it's like cry bag maybe just soak it all this and then put it sauce weight matter you're gonna use a lot is you're gonna see how much I put and it's getting you're gonna be like alright that's too much room well now you gotta really if that you don't want it because it gets watery so it was like you'll see you'll see for this move people make it differently and people that do make this how it makes it but and then you're gonna want to put more water barely any goes like that okay since it's a lot I put more a lot of gummy bears I put one if you don't do want to use sugar you don't really have to on see you know what would be a good idea with this though you could put uh you can make shots so not shots but you could mix it with like vodka or something and instead of water I'd be really good have you bomb have you ever done that cuz I should yeah miss a acknowledge now that I got the consistency that I want see that's not too drippy see that that's exactly what you want you don't want it dripping like crazy like water but you want it to be thick like thick like blood pretty much so you can use this for a Halloween party or whatever you need to use it for I don't really care I'm lying to you sugar but you barely if you do your sugar you use a spoon fool that's it but if you put a lot don't don't do that then you're gonna get hurt like high cholesterol right cut your leg off diabetes yeah yeah and it should be done now and then you are what you should do is overnight throw them in the fridge and then in the morning you take them out and they'll be super good it'll be better than they taste it at when you made on do taste test you yeah alright with it let me try it this is mom three of

This is gonna be really easy to do and depending on the fruit juice you use, or depending on your flavoring, you can essentially\nmake this as zero sugar and low carb as you would like. This is also a great\nreplacement for your kids. If you're trying to wing\nthem off of refined sugars, at least you can replace the juice with a all natural fruit juice and at least this way they're\ngetting the antioxidants and a natural sugar\nversus a refined sugar. So let's start with what\nyou're going to need to create this recipe. You're gonna need some\nsort of a silicone mold. I got this from Amazon. It was relatively affordable\nfor a pack of three and then the little dropper\nto dispense this in. I will link the ones I purchased\nin the description box, but you can get whatever\nmold that you want as long as it's silicone\nso that it pops out easily. Then you're gonna want,\nof course, some gelatin. I do eat meat, so I have regular gelatin. It's pure protein. I bought the large box because you're gonna\nneed quite a bit of this. If you buy the normal four pack envelopes, you're gonna use the entire\nbox for one cup of liquid. We're gonna want some sort of\na juice or water, something. Um, I have these Tohi Aronia berry drinks. These have no added sugars. Aronia berry is very\nsimilar to the Acai berry but has more antioxidants. A total of 12 grams of carbohydrates for an entire can. If you're sticking to a\nstrick ketogenic diet, then I would say, don't use this, use a sugar free Gatorade, a sugar free juice that you can find in\nyour local grocery store. Because I did do a test\nrun of these gummies, and they were actually quite fun and chewy and gummy-like\nand perfectly shaped. I did feel like I was missing\na little bit of that sweet and tart factor, so I went and picked up the vitamin strawberry watermelon\nliquid water enhancer with Vitamins B3, B6, and B12. This has no added sugars. There are some sugar alcohols in this, so it depends on how your\nbody reacts to sugar alcohols. Again, avoid maltodextrin. Or you can of course\nuse a liquid monkfruit or a monkfruit type of powder because we are gonna heat everything up. So that's everything you're gonna need and of course a measuring cup. You're gonna want one cup of liquid and I'm gonna use the rest of\nthis berry juice that I have. And then I'm gonna pop\nopen the second can. (can opening) (background music) (liquid pouring) Now I'm gonna add a couple drops of this strawberry\nwatermelon vitamin situation. (background instrumentals) Taste it and make sure\nit's the right sweetness. So, I'm gonna stir it up and taste it. (fork hitting glass) That definitely helped with the sweetness so I'm gonna add a little bit more. (fork hitting glass) And remember when you add the gelatin it's gonna dilute the flavor a little bit, so you do want it a little\nbit more tart and sweet. Heat up your liquid. You don't want it to boil but you definitely want\nit to be hot enough so that the gelatin\ndissolve in this mixture. (liquid pouring) (fire flame crackling) So I'm just gonna let that heat up while I measure out the gelatin. For one cup of liquid, you're gonna want 30 grams of gelatin. It's better to have a little\nbit more than a little bit less because you want it to be nice and firm and sturdy as a gummy bear. So now that the liquid is heated, I'm gonna pour it back\ninto my measuring cup just cause I prefer it this way. (liquid pouring) And then we're gonna add in the gelatin. So we're adding in a little\nbit over 30 grams of gelatin per one cup. (paper crinkling) (paper taring) (paper crinkling) (background music) Then you're gonna wanna\nmix this up really well. I like to use a fork. (fork hitting glass) Now for the fun part, and this\nis very therapeutic for me. You're going to take this little dropper and you're going to fill\neach of these little gummies. (background instrumental beats) (background instrumental beats) I always have a little bit of liquid left. I'm just gonna pour it\ninto a glass container and then you can cut it out. - -want these in the fridge. You want to let them sit\nfor at least 20-30 minutes in the fridge and then\nyou can pop them out. And a good tip is to not have\nthem sit in direct sunlight once they're done, they will melt in heat. They do last, like\nthrowing them in your bag and kind of going about your day. Just keep them out of direct sunlight and like very hot situations. But we'll be right back in\nabout 30 minutes for me, two seconds for you, to see the final results. And we're ready to check\nout all the gummies. So cute. So it's been a little over 30 minutes and the gummies should be all set now. With the silicone molds they're really easy to just pop right out. And look how cute they are! (background instruments) Definitely much more flavorful. There's a nice little tartness to it. (background instruments) And it's quite sweet. I really like them. So all you have to do is pop them out, put them in a container or a zip lock bag or some sort of a bag. Keep them in the fridge when\nyou're not gonna eat them, but you can take them on the go. Super good, super easy. Way healthier than conventional gummies. So I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you did, don't forget\nto give it a thumbs up.

welcome to Katie's playtime thank you to all my subscribers for asking me to make gummy bears and yes I do have a video already uploaded about how to make gummy bears using gelatin but in this video I'm going to do something different something where some people out there sitting at home don't like gelatin in their food so I've come up with a different recipe I've come up with a vegan vegetarian recipe on making your own gummy bears so for all the families out there I hope this is the winner for you and if this doesn't interest you I do have another video with gelatin so let's get started so the first thing you need to make sure you have is your glucose syrup so that's it that's the replacement for corn syrup so either glucose or corn syrup you also need some water you need some fruit juice you need some citrus pectin which is um you can actually get that from the health foods section in your supermarket or from any health food store and it is actually made in Mexico so for anyone over in America at the moment and you'll be able to find it I'm sure you also need some pink food coloring and over here you need some agar agar now agar agar is going to replace our gelatin fruit our citrus fruit pectin is actually going to replace our jelly so we also need some citrus acid citric acid if you're going to roll it in to make a sour type of lollies and some castor sugar and I've just got some icing sugar in a bowl here ready for when I roll them to make them just nice and plain we also need our sauce spoon a spoon make sure it's wooden or plastic because if it's a metal one it will heat up all the ingredients too quickly and also we can't forget our silicon molds so let's get started so the first thing you need is 1/2 a cup of water and place that in your saucepan you also then need 1/4 of a cup of glucose syrup and it's really really thick and gluggy so just be careful and take your time and then just give it a nice mix you need to mix us so both ingredients are nice and smooth together so our next step is to put our gelatin replacement in and that's going to be our agar agar now you can get that from your health food section in the supermarket or your health food store and it's gluten free its fructose free dairy free nut free and lactose free so anybody out there that's suffering from any of those this is the alternative to still make gummies and still have fun so in a normal recipe where it says how much gelatin you need just convert it into the same amount in agar agar so in my previous video it was two tablespoons of gelatin so I'm going to use two tablespoons of agar agar and we're going to mix that in and make sure there's no lumps okay so once you've mixed it and it's all nice and clear we're now going to put our jelly replacement in now what we want to do is we want to put one cup of our fruit juice so I'm just going to use my half a cup and I'm going to do two halves to make a one cup so I've got one half and then my other half to make one and in jelly it also does have gelatin in jelly so with this I'm going to use citrus pectin and what that is is that's gluten free as well dairy free it's soy free and it's lactose free and it's not free so all we're going to do is use three and a half teaspoons of this so it's a bit thick so we're going to add one and a half cups of water and now put three cups of sugar our last thing we need to put in is a food coloring so I've chosen the pink okay so now all of my ingredients are mixed together let's go over to the stove and heat it up and fingers crossed away so turning on the gas stove and just move it down to more of the lower heat and place our mix on and just keep stirring so keep stirring it until it goes nice and clear and it goes nice and like sticky if that makes any sense and once it cooks to that part then it's ready to put in our molds so come with me and let's start putting it in and so just using two teaspoons just carefully place it the mixture into your molds I'm using silicon molds just because it is easier to and take the gummies out afterwards so now I've put my molds in the fridge for half an hour and then in half an ounce time we'll see what we've got fingers cars yeah okay so our gummies are already they're out of the fridge so they're ready to be demolded and we'll see what we have got oh wow that looks great and so yes they are sticky like my other video so I've got my sugar my icing sugar and my citric acid here on plates and so that's just going to give me different flavors okay so there you have it I've got vegan vegetarian lactose-free gluten-free gummy lollies which I would probably say has a little bit of a jelly texture to them and they're not as chewy as your gummy so I suppose I now I have to do the taste tester so here we go let's just do a plain one mmm yeah definitely a jelly type of line really good now I've got the plain one to do so that's just plain no coating mmm and you can see inside is very jelly like absolutely amazing I know you're waiting for to see my face with the sour one I'll be ready I really travel that really jesu at the same time so thank you to all my subscribers that has asked me to do gummy lollies I have given you two videos because I just love you all so much enjoy I hope you enjoy making these at home be safe don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in my next video", "FM7STERkOyU": "hey guys uh fixed the lighting so you can see my messy room and all its glory uh right now i'm gonna make a video that i planned yesterday and it started with these gummy bears that i bought gummy bears and i said what if i took a couple gummy bear brands and compared them to real fruit snacks that you see in the stores compared their ingredients compared you know how much sugar is in them and stuff and their taste and see what like wins and i got some gatorade here to wash the flavor into my mouth before i like start trying something else so the contenders today are sweet 16 little gummy bears they're just candy gummy bears and i see on the back here it says imported product from spain i don't know if you can see that right there and i bought these at giant tiger and i got the classic hairy bow um these i don't know where they're made if they're made like in germany i know the companies in germany but i don't know where these but specific ones like are made and i got these in my local gas station so those are those are the junk they also like the junk ones and the real fruit ones are dare and it's a medley it says and here's the flavors on the back i'll tell you about them later when i'm trying them and yeah it's a real real fruit snack so we'll figure that out and this i believe is also there yeah and they are bear paws and i've had these before so i know what these taste like but the other ones i've never had before so okay we will see i'm a little worse today okay well we'll try the white i think the haribo one will be compared to the dare one right and these ones will be compared to these because these are kind of to me like this container and these are more directed at kids when these look more like like the adult gummy bears so i'll put those aside and i'll try these first so okay this comes with a little i like this container by the way this container is good and for six pieces you get 130 calories and i'm not gonna like go through the whole thing but you get 21 grams of sugar which is 21 percent of your daily intake of for only six pieces of these candies so i want to see if there's six colors whoa they smell really fruity okay i'm gonna put you down here because i want i want to like line them up the colors we have orange and we have do that does it say the flavors of these and also just to figure it out yourself white and green and wait see if i can zoom in here my stomach don't look my stomach is like rattling already because it's upset that it's gonna see this much gelatin i don't know if it's gelatin yeah it is okay so green orange white uh blue yellow oh he's upside down [Music] that's pretty much it so one two three four five six so there are six colors so for your what i said 130 calories and 21 grams of sugar you get one of each flavor if you wish or you can have like six of the same flavor i think i got all of them now as for feel it's been a long time since i've actually had gummy bears or like the classic gummy bears and um these feel like really fresh they're really bouncy like they're really and they're just they're really fresh and the size of them are quite large like they are just so large compared to you know regular things so i'm gonna back you up here because i'm gonna eat them i'll try these i'll try these six flares since there are six flavors so i'll try these and tell you what flavors they are this is a yellow one a little congested damn sorry lemon really really lemony it it reminds me of it's on my dish soap and i'm not kidding yeah you know like when you get the yellow dish soap and it's sunlight and has like sunshine lemon or whatever and you smell it and it's so strong it like goes in the back of your throat and you can taste it that's what that tastes like so if you like um sunlight dish soap that's the gummy bear for you this is the blue one i'm really hoping it's gonna taste like the blue raspberry or like blue gatorade i've got my nose here for a minute the hallmark all your notes on every video it's like the blue candies you would eat in the 90s you know like remember okay this this is taking me back remember the blue candy scare in the 90s during halloween you had to like inspect all blue candy because people were poisoning it and it was like toxic or something and you couldn't eat any blue candies so that to me is like the classic blue candy you find like in a gumball or in a licorice in the 90s i can't explain it it's a really i've not tasted that flavor for very very long time okay this is a white one surprising pina colada i'm not joking i think it's supposed to be pineapple but i'm getting coconut hints there yeah definitely yeah definitely like a pinot pina colada okay this is the orange which i'm assuming is orange and i hope it's actually going to taste like this orange gatorade because i like gatorade orange popsicle exactly an orange popsicle i wonder if these would freeze no seriously i wonder if they would i'm not a big candy eater i'll eat some chocolate like like at christmas time if they're really nice the dollar store around christmas time brings out some really nice chocolates that are from poland and they're like they're filled with like strawberry cream and hazelnut cream and coffee cream and i really like them but i'm not a big candy eater other than like gummy type candies and i like the starbursts um this is a green one please don't taste like pine sol tastes very neutral it tastes like um nothing you would relate to a green color it's just a sweet gummy bear i'm assuming this is cherry please be a cherry popsicle by the way these are quite difficult to chew they're quite gummy again not a cherry flavor i expected more cherry as the red ones in fact the green and the red don't taste much different i'll show you those all again you get quite a few and i say if you're really like a chewy fresh gummy bear these are the ones to get because they're large and they're they're just squishy and they're they're really nice and they have little faces on them i guess okay enough of those okay let's have it my stomach is really gonna hate me after this okay bear paws mixed fruit made with real fruit juice and puree no colors or flavors or high fructose corn syrup and vegetarian yeah right i'm sure for one pouch 80 calories that is too bad 14 grams of sugar and not much else other than that so say i've had these before i like them i like that i don't dislike beer you look pretty rotten for me to not like you these two these ones i kind of like because they're made for like to put in a kid's lunch so they all come in these little packages so you get like six of those six of them next little packages okay 30 fruit juices and puree first ingredient of the real fruit snack is corn syrup fruit juices from concentrate apple grape tangerine and elderberry sugar modified potato starch concentrated grape puree sunflower oil citric acid sodium citrate natural flavor beeswax maktain milk manufactured at a peanut free facility so if you're peanut free i guess this is something that you can have i think bear paws are peanut-free most like a lot of their stuff they make cookies and stuff oh yes peanut free right now so these i will tell you right now because i've had them before they come in different uh in different colors but they pretty much all taste like apples or at least to me they're pretty much pale so you get the and they're pretty much like they're they're shaped like bear paws they're all shaped like purple but they're all like that color or that color there's really no difference in flavor but i will try the dark one just to see i'll try a dark one and a light one because i have a lot of gummy bears to eat yet much easier to chew that one tastes like a crayon yeah compared to the really intense flavor of these that's a crayon that's a better crayon these are better crayon flavor kind of an orange this color in this color are different they're very similar but they are lighter and darker yeah i'll put those i'll put those with my gummy bears i don't want to eat all those there we go okay oh wait that's a harry potter i'll try these before i try them okay okay i want to compare to the hairy bows to these now hairy bows i notice um are a little smaller than these ones but you know what i uh really found the difference as being uh per 17 pieces instead of six okay these six of these six of these remember you have 21 grams of sugar for 17 pieces of these you get 140 calories and 18 grams of sugar like for 17 pieces and you also get three grams of protein in these you get two two grams of protein in these so that's the same on that right no artificial flavors oh yes sure and we have glucose syrup sugar gelatin dextrose fruit juices from concentrate apple raspberry strawberry orange lemon pineapple citric acid water fruit it has a lot of carrot and apple radish paprika black currant tomato flavoring what the it's okay i'm scared now it's really raining guys so i'll put these in a different face because it's not resealable so nice intense flavor flat flavor smell come on little children no they're not treats honey no they're not treats it's rattling like treat bag so you get a lot of yellow ones i see and i see the size the size is incredibly small compared to the spanish ones right get a size comparison here that's the the spanish gummy bear yeah you like spanish gummy bears and this is the haribo yeah gummy bear and side by side like you know yeah okay so again we have go down zoom in we have a lot of yellows here we have like a pink so we have like a pink and a yellow and a red and a orange and green and how many flavors [Music] white one okay so there they are so they're supposed to be one two three four five six yeah they're supposed to be strawberry orange apple raspberry all right she's missing out okay lemon and pineapple so i'm guessing this is the strawberry and this is the raspberry and that's the orange i'm thinking they're very similar in color the green is supposed to be apple that's supposed to be pineapple again so i'm sure it'll be pina colada flavor and that's lemon okay so okay let's try this strawberry one back up here okay strawberry one a little denser than the these ones they don't fall party my eats were chewy but this is a little bit i can't explain it it's just a little harder that's a very fake strawberry it's like it's like strawberry gatorade you don't like the new stuff the strawberry that's what that's what it is i okay orange orange a little different flavor than the spanish gummy bears more of a if you get a lollipop you know how you go the hairdresser and they give you a lollipop when you're under 12. um that's what that tastes like an orange lollipop no okay this is the raspberry you don't like it down there's nothing like i said no okay i just got it now raspberry flavor just came through now um hard to compare it it's kind of a cough drop flavor cough syrupy flavor but more fruit punchy flavor to me anyways let's wash my mouth out okay lemon same as every lemon flavored thing it's just a lemon lollipop flavor it's not it's not a popsicle there's nothing it's a lemon lollipop lollipops okay apple apparently i don't know if these were supposed to be apple but i didn't taste apple anyway yeah okay that one tastes like apple very fake apple but still still an apple they are not easy to chew these are supposed to be pineapple again more pineapply more pineapply than these these were pina colada i'm not joking yeah so if you want comparison i think you're pretty equal like these for for the gummy bears versus gummy bears [Music] they're equally good i think like for this like the gummy bears versus these i think these are probably a healthier option due to the fact that you can have one pouch with just as many um yummy bears in it with not as much sugar and not uh as much calories do i think it's like the ideal thing to feed your kid no i wouldn't feed my kid this if i had one because they they are really of no nutritional value other than a sweet chewy snack and they're not that sweet to be honest with you they're not that sweet they they taste um like a uh some of them taste like an unsweetened applesauce so yeah so like for for taste probably kid would cook for this better like or more because like they're just a really they're more vibrant flavor but as for more i'm not saying they're healthy but i'm saying less sugar less carrot than these this would be the way to go and hide these for yourself under the bed okay over to real fruit gummies and i'm so glad i don't have to eat any more of these after this okay now it says for over 120 years our family-owned business has held itself to a higher standard we are committed to giving you the products you want and to using the very best ingredients to make them because to our family made better isn't just a claim it's our problem and it's also peanut free on the back i guess all their things are there here makes candy and it makes cookies i don't know if they do in any other country but i know they do here so okay the flavors here are supposed to be cherry orange blueberry blueberry lemon raspberry and strawberry and for eight candies you get 130 calories and 21 grams of sugar 2 grams protein so pretty much you're you're getting two more gummies then than these but for the same nutritional value so okay let's put you down again okay and we have much bigger gummies they smell terrible i have to just just say that like out loud right now they smell like plaster or something they don't smell good they really don't i don't know what i'm getting here there's a lot of dark ones on the bottom i don't know if i'm getting all right let's see i don't want to eat these also the shape the shape of what uh flavor they're gonna be there's strawberry and here's a lemon and i guess that's a raspberry and a blueberry and uh orange is that all we have for flight one two three four five six one two three four five oh oh here's a cherry to put those back it's not terrible i like it i don't want to eat these don't make me eat me okay so there they are arthur precious i'm gonna just put this off because i really don't want to try them okay okay here it goes uh by the way what's in these corn syrup again sugar fruit purees pears strawberries and cherry concentrated fruit juices chip tangerine lemon elderberry raspberry and blueberry modified coconut oil natural flavor gelatin pectin citric and absorbic acid potassium citrate carnauba wax may contain milk okay um which of these smelly little things am i gonna try first i'll try the what i think will be the worst flavors okay and i think lemon and orange are gonna be the worst of these guys this is a lemon okay almost judged it's a filling of a lemon meringue pie not bad at all not bad at all a lot softer to chew like not a not a like a dense gummy bear orange you taste a punch of orange really weird aftertaste it's almost a plastic orange does not taste good no no no no no okay strawberry almost jam very much strawberry jam that is actually quite good the strawberry almost strawberry jam okay this little heart looking thing is a cherry you kidding me the first taste you get is like suntan lotion i'm not joking and then it graduates off to a fake cherry flavor okay what's this one raspberry something lotion again now it tastes like a banana boy you missed on that one smoked the raspberry it tastes like suntan lotion and

this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much

to show you how to make this delicious homemade marmalade marmalade is a type of candy made from sugar and pure fruit which is sold everywhere in Latvia and probably Russian Eastern European countries and today we will be making my favourite it's just like lemon with orange it's gonna be lemon marmalade it's so yummy super delicious kids love this recipe and you can just have it well it's looking last very long because you're probably gonna eat it but it's really nice I hope you enjoyed this recipe let's get started in your pan add your lemon juice and then orange juice and then we're going to add some orange zest and then lemon zest and I'm gonna mix everything together the flavors and the smell is already so good we're going to cook this for a couple of minutes until you see it starts to bubble up and just keep mixing it until it starts to cook down and reduce once the flavor is infused we're gonna sieve it through and put all the mixture into a cup we don't want to have any bits of that in our marmalade and just gently press down so you get all the juice as much as you can next take your pan and add all your a lemon and orange juice then I'm gonna add some gelatin and you need quite a lot of gelatin for this recipe and just mix everything together until it melts and you don't have any any lumps just keep mixing it together and cook it on a medium heat you don't want to burn this as well and make sure there are no lumps of gelatin anywhere and just mix it through so it becomes kind of nice and even mixture just like this so when it's done you're going to add some sugar and it's a lot of sugar so just add all your sugar inside and then we're going to add the rest of our lime juice and the rest of our orange juice inside and then just mix everything together so the mixture will start to come and even out and we want to make sure that all the sugar melts together but the flavor of this is so so delicious and fresh and citrusy we're going to cook this for a couple of minutes until it's all melted and you can see bubbles on the sides just keep stirring it occasionally then we're going to [Music] guys and girls I have my recipe on my website at Ali's yummy food calm you'll find full ingredients and also directions on how to make this and also you'll be able to find loads of other recipes that I do for my channel and just click through click on the picture and you'll be able to see the whole video with the directions and the full recipe in English and Russian languages to prep our mold you can use any molds that you wish I'm just using a baking tin with some parchment paper and I have sprayed it with some cooking oil then I'm gonna add my lemon and orange marmalade inside and I'm gonna place this into the fridge so it gets nice and set this will take couple of hours or so after that I take it out of the fridge and I'm gonna add some more sugar on top to make sure it doesn't stick to my hands and you want to move your hands around and rub the sugar in just like that and then we're going to flip this around and on to the other side and add more sugar on top and just repeat the process by rubbing sugar inside our marmalade and then you want to take a really really sharp knife and then slice your marmalade inside and it will stick to your knife as well because the sides are not covered in the sugar but don't worry it's it's it's a it's a patient process and just keep slicing that up and then finally you will start to see these little lil shapes and then cut them into triangles or whatever way you like to serve it traditionally we have them in triangles and you can cover the bits in sugar as well so they don't stick to your hands or to your knife and there you go look at this it's so so pretty so delicious really really soft in the middle tastes so amazing so much better than the shop bought one a lot of flavor a lot of citrusy flavor and I absolutely love the homemade version I really really hope you try these guys they're little little pockets of sweets this is what I used to have as a child and they're very very stringy and I love that look at this check out all the other videos I have and make sure to like and comment on this video thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description below and also over

by our early house [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "JtIIWMZBqgk": "[Music] fruit punch from amigo games fruit punch comes with 56 cards one

because today's video just might get your sweet tooth going I'm going back to my roots why he lowed us why I am gonna attempt to make what is the latest craze in Hawaii right now and it's called lemon peel gummies I'm gonna be using gummy bears you can use in this recipe your gummy candy of choice but what it's made of is gonna be very interesting it is such a popular thing right now that I had a hard time finding the ingredient to do this but I got my hands on something that I think will work and we're gonna give it a try my mouth stay watering already okay cuz I'm super excited to eat this so this interests you this is a local Hawaii snack any local kid in Hawaii knows about this they've bought it they've made it but I'm here in Montana so let's see how this Hawaii Montana girl does making lemon peel gummies all right so here's the dried lemon it's an entire lemon that's been dried now lemon peel strips would have been ideal for this but again it sold out everywhere so I was only able to find the entire dried lemon whole lemon dried which is okay we can work with that then we need juice of a lemon so either from a fresh lemon or bottled lemon juice some leaking whey powder some granulated sugar and then your gummy candy of choice and I went with Haribo gummy bears cuz they're my favourite so the first thing we want to do is extract the lemon juice again if you have bottled lemon juice that would work just fine I just happen to have a fresh lemon on hand and this lemon juicer so it gave me an opportunity to use it I was able to get about three to four tablespoons of lemon juice I'm really bad at measuring you guys I'm more of a cook by sight kind of kind of person so I'm really just guessing put that into your mixing bowl and then we add the lehigh powder and again maybe one to two tablespoons of that now we want to sweeten it up a little bit more because the lean way powder is sweet but it's also very salty so we want to add some sugar mix it up pretty well not pretty my mouth is watering just watching this [Music] all right set that aside now we're going to prep the lemon peel now again I mentioned the strips would have been best for this recipe but I couldn't find them everywhere is out of stock so I'm cutting up these entire dried lemons and I'm also picking out any seeds that I can find because the seed will add unwanted bitterness to your candy I'm going to throw it in a blender and blend it up we want it to be more like a powder or granules or something more fine that you can sprinkle over your candy I know it doesn't look very appetizing but I promise you it is delicious hey give that a stir again once more we want to make sure that the sugar is well dissolved and start adding your gummy candy and mixing I did four bags of gummy bears because I had so much lemon juice I really didn't think I was going to be able to get that much lemon juice out of that lemon but that was quite the juicy lemon mix in the lemon peel hey I'm gonna taste it hmm [Music] sweet sour salty perfect for carrying my craving yeah a tunnel [Music] so which flavors your favorite out of gummi bears mine is white pineapple that's my favorite and then it's the green one which is strawberry better package this up before I stand here and I eat this whole bowl alright guys so that was it that was my little experiment of making lemon peel gummies for the very first time here in Montana making a Hawaii style snack here in Montana and I think it wasn't a success it's not gonna last long in my house that's for sure and I'll see if I can give some to my nieces because I'm sure they're gonna love it too but yeah this worked out so well and I'm so happy that you stuck around this long and if you liked the video give it a thumbs up thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already and if you hit that notification bell you'll know when I put out another video which is on average about once a week so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you again next time [Music] Shh very quiet the kids are sleeping and I'm trying to be sneaky hmm so I can eat this without sharing mm-hmm and that includes not sharing with my husband mm-hmm you", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow legends

to get playing today go back to playing them are you winning I'm playing hey winning are you we're not going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

Today we are going to be making something\nthat we've never made before: We are going to be making gummies! I learned how to make gummies when I was on\nthe set of \"Feast Of Fiction\". Jimmy Wong and Ashley taught me how to make\nLego Gummies, it was so much fun. I'll put a link down below so you can check\nout the video if you missed it! The recipe was so good that I wanted to share\nit with you all, so today I'm gonna be making Bejeweled Gummies! Let's get started! The things you will need will be a big pot,\nsome unflavored gelatin, and we're gonna need six Jell-O flavors. You're gonna need Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,\nBlue, Purple and then for the clear gems, you're just gonna use the regular gelatin\nand we'll have to add a little flavor. Anything that is a clear-flavoring will be\nfine. I've got two options here. I I've got \"Cotton Candy\" or \"Pineapple\", whatever\nflavoring you'd like, we'll use that. And then you're gonna need gem-molds, I\njust found these at the store, but if you can't find them at the store, I'll put a link\ndown below so you can find it online. Take a look at that! They look just like the game! You'll also need 1/2 a Cup measuring cup,\na baster, and a bunch of bowls to mix our Jell-O up! Let's put it all together! The first thing that you're gonna do is separate\nall your different gem-gummy colors by Jell-O. Everybody gets their own bowl so you have\na little Jell-O Packet and then 3 gelatins. First we're gonna add our 3 packs of gelatin,\nthen we're gonna add our Jell-O Pack... Then you're gonna take a spoon, mix it all\naround... Then you're gonna-ha-add 1/2 a Cup of water... Eeeeuuuhh don't drop it, don't drop it, don't\ndrop it! Eeeewwwuh- I'm so buff, I'm so buff! Then mix it around again! After you've mixed up the red one, now you're\njust gonna do this to all of your other colors, and your clear one we're gonna do something\na little bit different, you're gonna add 6 packs of gelatin, 1/2 a Cup of water and a\nteaspoon or tablespoon if you want a LOT of flavor of whatever little flavoring you'd\nlike! I'm choosing \"Cotton Candy\"! Now that we've got all of our Jell-O's mixed\nup, they're nice and thick! Even our little white, clear one- Look at\nthat! Really thick, it should feel like mashed potatoes,\nyou're gonna get your pot, fill it with some water and head over to the stove. Fill your pot with about an inch and a half\nof water and bring to a boil. Then, place the bowl of gelatin into the pot\nand stir with a spoon until it dissolves. 'til it's all liquid! When a layer of foam begins to spread across\nthe top, it is done! Remove the pot from the heat and grab your\nbaster. You're gonna use the baster to transfer the\nmix into your gem-molds. It's really, really handy 'cuz it's gonna\nbypass all the foam on the top and you're gonna get that clear color from the bottom! Fill all your molds and pop them into the\nfreezer for about 15 minutes to set. Once your molds have set, you're just gonna\npop 'em out and they'll look like this. Dew-doooooooo! It's super easy, I'll show you how to do it. So you have a mold just like that... ...they're very durable, but I always am a\nlittle bit gentle, just take a corner... ...and pull 'em out! A little Jell-O Jiggler! I'm putting these little gummies on a piece\nof wax-paper because I'm gonna cut them to be a closer shape to the actual game. For little purple gummies, I'm gonna cut them\nto look like a triangle, so I'm just gonna cut off the top of the gem, perfect! Then for the green gummies, I'm gonna cut\neach corner at a diagonal, just a little bit! Then I'm gonna do the same thing to these\nlittle white ones. Ta-daaaa! Here are The Bejeweled Jell-O Gummies that\nwe made! I hope you guys liked 'em! Again, I'll put the recipe down below- I learned\nthis from \"Feast OF Fiction\". I had so much fun with them and I hope you\nguys enjoy it! If you have any other suggestions for any\nother Nerdy Nummies, please let me know! Leave me your comment down below...put it\ndown 'dhere! And I'll do my best to make it happen! Also, you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter,\nTumblr, Instagram... I'll post lots of pictures of these yummy\nlittle gummies and if you guys create these, I love to see your baking creations so please\nsend them to me! I get a big kick out of it! All right, thanks again you guys! Bye-bye!", "z4ul-iEOplY": "[Music] welcome to my channel my name is myra and if you're returning thank you so much for watching again and today i'm going to show you how to make dulce's enchiladas four different ways there is quite a few candies that you can use to make the dulces enchiladas i am using sour patch sour streamers and then i am also using skittles these are all from the dollar store so you don't have to buy expensive candy the gummy bears are also from the dollar store and then these i got from my local grocery store and these are just fruit gushers in case you want to try these with different candies but don't want to spend too much you can always look for a variety pack that will give you more for your money to start off you will need a bowl and this is going inside the microwave so make sure it is a material that can go in there and then we're using powdered sugar and i'm just taking half a cup we are also going to be using chamoy and i am using the branda more you want to make sure to add equal amounts so we're adding half a cup as well [Music] now i'm just taking a fork and making sure i try to dissolve as much as i can and don't worry if you have a little bit of crumbs once you put it inside the microwave it's going to disappear adding this to the microwave really helps the powder sugar dissolve a little bit better and it also makes your consistency a little bit thicker which is exactly what we need for our candies for my first set of candies i will be using fruit gushers and i want to point out the amount of mixture that i'm using very little goes a long way so if you're planning to do just a few you might not need half a cup like i did just even the amounts of the chamoy and the powdered sugar and you will be perfectly fine [Music] next i'm dipping my fruit gushers into the lime juice i'm using concentrated but if you have fresh ones you can do that as well for our final step we're just adding the fruit gushers to the tahin and you want to make sure to fully cover them [Music] i like mine to be fully dry before i eat them but it's all up to you personal preference for our second mixture we will also be using half a cup of the powdered sugar i will be using two bottles of lucas and in case you don't know this is a really good substitute for chamoy [Music] we will also be adding this to the microwave and it's just 25 seconds [Music] this time i decided to use skittles and i am going to fully cover it with our mixture again and i will be adding pico de gallo if you're not familiar with this this can be added to fruit and it makes it taste amazing we will also be using some tajin and i will just be adding this on top of the pico de gallo [Music] when using any type of sour candy you want to avoid adding it to the lime juice because this will make it extremely sour and ruin your candy [Music] for our fourth way you want to do the same mixture add lime juice i'm taking a fruit roll up some lucas this is a mango type some tajin and pico de gallo don't forget to subscribe and let me know what type was your favorite [Music]", "T6cQPOrVvdM": "what's up YouTube welcome to guava juice this is my laboratory where safety is number one priority today we're gonna do an experiment I have here the world's largest gummy bear I mean look at that that's huge like look at this it says here 5 pounds right over there that's one have you bear today we're gonna see what happens when we boil this gummy bear who knows I might eat it hey first things first we have to unbox is gummy bear to see how ridiculous this looks I mean look at this this is the size of my hand look at this red delicious bear that's screaming cavity I will give you cavities come here boy ok so we have the gummy bear right here we have the pot and we have the stove so we want to put this on super hot and now we wait and see what happens next as you can see it's only been three minutes and the bear is starting to melt look at this hmm don't feel bad it's just candy it's just a whole bunch of sugar with a red food coloring I apologize for the graininess in advance because I accidentally set the ISO to 40,000 that's right 40,000 anyways five minutes has passed and this is what it looks like I mean we still see a little bit of the body but it's mostly mostly mostly boiling off of the body eight minutes have passed you see a little bit of the body still and it's still the same a little bit of boiling yeah eleven minutes have passed it's starting to look like the kool-aid man just took a poop and it's looking little wishy fifteen minutes it looks like the kool-aid man accidentally pooped his heart look at that that's kind of gross this boiling gummy thing is looking really gross right now finally realized the ISO was set to 40,000 so I set it back to regular and the gummy bear is looking like a brain I got bored during this time so I decided to be a good idea to put a banana in there interesting enough it looked pretty cool look at this it's like a gummy banana pretty gross I wouldn't eat it but it looks pretty dope I was still bored so I decided to put a lemon in there too hey unfortunately the little was from the gummy popped in my hand and hurts so bad I hate you I hate after six minutes of leaving the gummi coat on the fruits this is the result it was super sticky felt like bubblegum it smell like bubblegum and look like bubblegum and the gummy bear itself looked like it just drowns in lava I mean look at this there's no way who could have survived that look at that just looks like straight-up chocolate poop after 41 minutes I decided it was time to take this thing out because the whole house smelt like smoke like I was so scared this thing would light on fire I mean look at this it looks like a volcano waiting to erupt except it's a gummy volcano I have a confession to make the microphone was off the whole video so I lip-sync the whole video if you couldn't tell us so bear with me as I try to lip-sync this look at this look how sticky and hard and dark this thing is this is ridiculous it's basically burnt sugar like sugar that is burnt think about the next time you eat your next gummy bear or gummy worm or gummy octopus or gummy peach or gummy watermelon origami shark or gummy gummies so now it's time to see what it tastes like here we go mmm Bon Appetit mmm mmm oh it's hot it's hot my tongue oh oh it's hot it's hot oh my gosh yeah yeah Oh oh my gosh look how hard it is it became super solid all of a sudden what the heck look at this look at that oh my gosh this thing just fell off instantly Wow Wow ahh oh that is ridiculous Wow okay let's try this again just want to make sure it does the same thing alright let's do this alright how's my lip sticking guys is it doing well I hope I hope so anyways oh my gosh this thing okay I'm gonna put it in my mouth one more time let's see if it does the same thing okay here we go Bon Appetit oh my gosh boy Joel Oh oh my gosh look at this look at this it's hard again it's freaking solid that is ridiculous Wow this is insane so dudes never eat boiled gummy bear because look at this if you think about it really closely look at what you're putting in your system every time you eat a gummy bear that is what you're putting in your system so think about the next time you eat it will you eat it because I will yeah piece ah dudes by", "Nz3FOoMJAYw": "hey there today i am bringing you a product review and ketone test which has been highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "cToho9CnfkE": "hey guys shooting another video here again so I keep getting the question from a lot of people it basically will a sour gummy work for this recipe which is you know vodka infused gummy to be honest with you I haven't done it yet so I went out picked up an extra pack here of sour gummy worms it's our neon crawlers whatever you want call them and for this recipe I'm thinking about using some absolute ruby red which is like a red grapefruit vodka figured that'd be a good combination of flavors there so we will see what happens when we do this experiment basically will these things hold up to the vodka or will they just dissolve you know they're made a little bit differently and they have that a crystallized sour sweet sugar on the outside so let's see what happens we'll just get our Tupperware and one pack of our sour brite crawlers I love these things delicious so if you spread them out and they're going to plump up so it may not look like a whole lot right now but once they've soaked I'll probably double triple in size so get them all in there go ahead grab my ruby red come on now one-handed all right some good stuff here so we'll do a little pour just want to cover them to the top a little bit over all right perfect was probably about mmm maybe eight ounces of vodka this was already open so I did not use that whole mount that whole bottle there you know I had to have a couple drinks before but anywho make sure they're settled in as you can see look like they'll hold up pretty good but you never know like I said they are made a little bit different than your regular gummies so this is an experiment for both of us so hopefully they'll turn out good have a big party coming up this weekend gonna make some nice treats for everyone so basically you just want to take your sealed gummy worms bring them over your fridge set mine down real quick get up in your fridge take these bad boys place them in the fridge I'm just going to let them sit to absorb that vodka you know every day or so you can get in there stir them around make sure they're not sticking and they should start plumping up on you and once you see these the level of vodka there go down you just want to top it off just keep them you know topped up that way they don't dry out or anything so we'll come back and check on that in about a day and give it a stir and then after a few days I'll show you the final property everybody we're back here with the follow-up to the sour gummy infused with vodka this was the first time I've ever done them but I've been getting a lot of questions from people on whether or not it would work just because the actual gummies themselves are kind of a different consistency and they have you know that different like sugar coating on them and stuff but as you can see here they turned out pretty well I would say they've grown maybe double size the color on them is definitely a lot lighter you can tell that there's some liquid infused in there but overall it's been a good test I think there's pretty successful I only had to really top it off about one time over the you know last three days they didn't soak up as much as I was expecting but still did pretty good as for a texture and just grab one out of here see that one snapped right in half it's actually pretty soft show you the center there if you could see try and focus seems to be pretty consistently filled you can tell the core is a little bit more green than the rest look it's just dissolving right there in my fingers yeah it's really soft not not really slimy but it is slippery let me taste a little piece and see just how infuse they are whoo Wow oh man they soaked up a lot of vodka has um actually has a really good taste till this one was like a lime or something so you can really taste that but uh it's definitely got a kick and some heat from the vodka so I would say it's a success it is possible to do with the sour gummies whether it be worms or sour gummy bears or whatever but yeah looks good they're easy to make and should make a good addition to the party so thank you for watching if you guys have any questions comments or requests just let me know and hope to see you around my channel and thanks for watching", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "xy8FJSBzcWA": "hey sugar geeks today we're making a super fun and bouncy rose wine gummy these little guys are super easy to make are perfect for kick toppers and tastes just like rose a rose a all-day y'all okay so the first thing we're to do is add our wine to a large measuring cup we're gonna need one and a half cups wherever however much you have in your bottles then we're gonna add in our sugar be aware that you're lying me pizza when you have this layer sugar is honestly totally optional it just makes the wine gummies a little bit sweeter all right so now we're gonna add in four packs of gelatin and you just want to sprinkle that over the surface and try not to like just dump it all in otherwise it's gonna make clothes so I'll just like push down and then add some more and this is called blooming and what it does is its allowing the gelatin to absorb liquid so if you needed more more gummies than just this you could just multiply this batch one and a half cups a liquid beer wine juice whatever you need and then we're gonna let this bloom for five minutes okay it's been five minutes now I'm gonna go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then 15 second increments until all of the gelatin is all melted and there's no granules go inevitably there's going to be some foam on the top you just scoop that off with a spoon if you don't scoop it off it will stay in your gummies so depending on if you want foam works great for beer gummies not so great for wine gummies and then we're gonna add in our corn syrup this is what makes the gummies gummy just mixing until dissolved if you don't want to use corn syrup you can totally use honey just keep in mind that honey is going to give it a honey flavor so it'd be like honey wine honey rose a I mean that kind of sounds amazing so Rose a-after do you add all of the gelatin and stuff it actually ends up being kind of oranjee looking so I have a little bit of water here and I'm going to add a drop of electric pink and the reason I'm putting it in the water first is because the gel does not like to dissolve and alcohol weird I'm just gonna add a couple drops and that just brings like that rose pink color back all right so now we're ready to pour our gummy mixture into the mold I just got these off of Amazon you can use ice mold silicone molds whatever kind of sphere molds you have just kind of squeegeeing the extra jell-o mixture down so I don't have any big gloves you'd be surprised how far one and a half cups of wine will take you can make several types of bowls if you end up with like spilling a ton of this you know like over the edge you can't actually remelt it so once it sets you can just remelt it in the microwave crazy I know all right our dummies have been chilling in the fridge literally look at that so cute yeah look how cute those are so that is how you make ROS a wine gummies be sure to check out next week's episode of sugar geek show where we turn this recipe into a rose a jello faultline cake

bear maker we all have cherished childhood memories with these gummy little candies wouldn't it be fun to be able to make them whenever you want let's go ahead and start looking at the machine like all the other nostalgia products the first thing you'll notice is the vibrant box the only thing you're going to need to pick up when you get this and the ingredients to make your own gummy bears it has everything else already inside the box as always the box is completely covered with the information advertising the product inside it just some general statistics dimensions and what comes inside but we're gonna actually take a look at that right here let's start off with the instruction book like other nostalgic products the instruction book is in English Spanish and French it goes over a lot of the items within the box where I want to jump straight over to the recipes the instructions give you recipes for basic or sour gummies vitamin gummies and energy gel chews but I'm sure you could come up with your own variations easily alright let's take a look at everything that actually comes inside the box I contacted them and they sent me two extra-large gummy bear silicone trays so that I could replace both the fish and the worm insert so that I can do full sets of gummy bears these are the fish gummies that are supposed to be like the swedish fish let's replace that with the regular gummy and then these are the gummy worms trays I'm gonna replace that with another one of the large gummies right here and then the other two will be two more of the actual large gummies that come with it now I have a full tray of nothing but gummy bears now let's take a look at the actual heating element for this device it's bright orange has the name printed on the front of it has an on/off button right there and as a removable tray inside so that you can heat up your gelatin and take it out in case want it to burn nice protect your on the plug I think yep that's everything in the box we'll go ahead and set that aside and we'll get everything set up here so that we can actually start making our very own gummies a cool feature that the trays have is that they lock together to make a full doughnut that way they don't fall off the table or you inadvertently knock them aside once they are all put together they have a hole in the center so that you can feed the electrical cord from the heater right through the bottom and they have little legs so it's up off the ground just enough so that the cord doesn't get snagged on anything and then you sit in the heater elements right down in the center so that you have your cooking area and mold area all in the same spot then when it's done all you have to do is take apart the connecting molds and put them in your fridge so that they can cool and solidify now that we have the unit completely set up let's plug it in and turn it on so it can begin heating and we'll get ready to start making our very own gummy bears this is everything you're going to need to make four different flavored gummy batches each batch will require one half cup of cold water one packet of flavored gelatin and four packs of unflavored gelatin once you have all the ingredients assembled take your heating bowl and put the one-half cup of cold water inside it then it's time to take your one pack of flavored gelatin tear off the top and pour it directly into that water oh look at that go we're gonna make orange first now we're gonna need four packs of unflavored gelatin that's four ounces each pack is one ounce apiece tear off the top and dump that in and that'll help further solidify these into thicker gummies once all your jello mix and gelatin packets have been put inside the half cup of water you're going to want to stir it as much as possible it's gonna be a little bit thick and lumpy but don't worry as it heats up the gelatin will d solidify and become a nice thick liquid that's easy to manipulate and pour into the molds as you can see here it's a bit lumpy and gross and some of it sticks to the spoon but don't worry it'll solidify into a really delicious smelling liquid that's ready to pour into the molds and thicken up into your perfect gummy bears now we're going to put our mixture inside the heating Bowl directly into the heating unit depending on your altitude in 5 to 10 minutes the mixture will become runny and easy to work with once you're ready to start pouring your mixture into the molds don't forget to turn off your unit because you'll no longer need the heating element now you're ready to start pouring your mixture into all of the molds and don't worry the first couple of times you're gonna have a little bit of spillage and it's easy to clean up just use a spoon here I go I'm gonna spill it right here just use a spoon just scoop it up and slide it into the next nearest mold any excess of the liquid around it will easily peel away but at this point it's still really easy to manipulate move to where you want it to go so just do that and keep filling up each one of the gummies remember that each time you use it you're gonna make a different flavor so you're gonna go ahead and fill up as many of them as you can until you run out of the liquid now the instructions say that once you're finished filling the molds to put them in the refrigerator for five to ten minutes I found to get them to solidify they needed to be in there for about 30 to 40 minutes once they were firm then I was able to remove them from the mold without damaging them now if you're doing the gummi bears using this pay attention to the ears because the main body of the molds fill up quite easily but the ears don't I had to come back in with a spoon later on and just slide some of the liquid from the head up into the ears to make sure that all of my gummies were properly formed now while I finish pouring the rest of this orange gummy bear mixture into the molds I'd like to point out a few maintenance tips the main body you have to wash by hand and recommend putting the heating bowl in the microwave or inside the dishwasher because it may rust however the molds themselves the silicone inserts they can go right inside the dishwasher without a problem it's just the main unit in the heating bowl that really wouldn't respond well to that but if you do that you'll have your mold for considerable amount of time and in the future I'm sure you could use the stovetop to heat up your jello gummy bear mixture and still use the molds for years to come and the fact that it comes with several different ones allows you to make gummy bears for all kinds of different recipes like you could use the worms to make chocolate cupcakes with worms coming out of them so that they look like grave dirt you can do underwater interesting things using the fish or you can even use these to decorate cakes so the sky's the limit on your imagination but the gummy bears themselves make a really nice snack well there you have it the gummy bears themselves are completed and it's time to pop them in the fridge we'll give them about 35 minutes to solidify here they are once they're done let's go ahead and take the mold out of the holding case and then we'll pop some of these out so that we can take a look at them once we're done we'll make a few more batches and I'll do a nice little arrangement to show you all the different flavors that I produced using this unit as you can see here they pop right out and the gummies are quite adorable now they're still not completely as firm as they will become there's still a little bit jiggly but once you pull them all out of the molds and you leave them in the fridge overnight they firm up nicely and that's it that's how you make the gummy bears it's really quite simple the system is really nice and I highly recommend you guys get this that you can try it out yourself just another fantastic product from the nostalgic company I've enjoyed every one of the reviews I've made for their products I hope you have - as well as my other 800 videos on the channel if you have don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button and as always I'll see in the next one [Music] [Music]", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks",

complaining about not having the gummy recipe or if they were attempting to do it but you know it didn't come out right so yeah I'm making a video for it okay so here you go all right so you have a couple of CMOS you wanna make sure you got your blender on here so we want to go ahead and pour that in there all right so in the batch I usually do about for about four or five tablespoons of sea moss I put five tablespoons in as I added two tables spoons of a bar Sara four tablespoons CMOS jail okay so you want to have your a bar a bar powder [Music] two tablespoons I like one healthy tables on and deadlight I'm not so healthy table small so like a little over one and a half all right so the trick to this is I so yeah you wanna you know don't put it on medium heat just keep it on I mean almost today almost hi all right but then you know a little lower you wanted to you know boil real good especially you're gonna get that egg water boil a little good so anyways gonna work all right now you can get a wispy said that for like three minutes but you know you want to keep this day long for about at least 10 minutes but whisking it alright stirring it cost you know you can keep an eye on it you know make sure that is still liquid all right but I say give it about let's say seven to ten minutes okay while you're constantly whisking it came out um two tablespoons of agar agar powder two tablespoons of Gavi sweetener all right juice mr. Heath and I wish to risk it with the port pasta we're about to say about seven minutes and Here I am okay alright and this is how they came out all right my CMOS gummies they came out they keep alright and you know they're not they're not melting or anything like that you know they came out and go for I'll show you yes we have kids arguing in the background here they are like I said they're nice and firm and nice he kept okay nicely moulded nice deformed all right they won't melt or anything like that alright there you have it right you see Moscow here's your recipe all right these are for me okay and for the kids also I have more than the fridge stored that I'll be a moment as we speak okay that's the first batch I put it now it sit down alright here is my back you see most gummies and I hope you enjoyed my video and the recipe for it please go to my website the link is in the description comment like share alright thank you", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again

go shopping I went trick-or-treating Milky Way's tootsie rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing my milky way to go cocoa for this you'll need a spoon a mug of milk for small milky way's and a microwave unwrap your milky way's and put them into the mug of milk now microwave for 30 seconds at a time [Music] strain each time until the milk is hot and the milky way's are melted still needs more there it's all melted and it smells really good this Milky Way cocoa is out of this world check out the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's not too sticky to handle you can take it out of the bowl and knead with your hand [Music] gummy and yummy and so fun funny and you can still eat it hmm hope you had a killer haul this

simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make alcoholic gummy bears these are so simple so yummy let's go [Music] a small saucepan and put in a third of a cup of water one packet of jell-o or jelly crystals something like this then add 15 grams of unflavored gelatin and just let that sit for five minutes to glyco phi and absorb the water now the unflavored gelatin here that i use is this kind now for those that don't know what unflavored gelatin does that's what makes jello become gummy so if you just use jello it'll be very wobbly and fall apart you put the unflavored gelatin in it becomes gummy you get the texture of the gummy bear all right even now that this has glorified and absorbed the water turn the heat on to medium want to bring this to the boil and have this dissolve the crystals all right that looks ready now turn the heat off and we'll get to the next part and for however many colors you want just do this with each different color now get something else like a measuring cup that has a poorer on it and add about anywhere from a quarter to a third of a cup of vodka now add this to it now get your molds of little bears and just pour the mixture straight in just leave these here on the counter for about 15 minutes so they can set just slightly and then transfer them to the freezer where you leave them for 20 to 25 minutes if you want to only put them in the fridge leave them in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour and just take them straight out as you can see alcoholic gummy bears the gummy they wouldn't give to do that if they were only jello young and any other colors that you've chosen oh there you go now it's a party so you've got tons of alcoholic gummy bears look at them beautiful if you like these oh yeah this little dude yummy

contains 1.5 million scovilles that means one gummy bear is equivalent to 6 1 chip challenges yeah so literally this box you see how tiny anna's gummy bear is i'm just very surprised that it contains 9 million Scoville that's literally 900 times spicier than a jalapeno pepper yeah so I figured the only way to do this properly is to slowly work my way up there so we have different gummies here this is a regular gummy bear as you can see the only difference between this and this is this one has a dynamite in the middle that's probably a pretty insane so I made that but in the meantime let's open this Wow utilize the space here huh alright here it is oh my goodness that looks so intentional gummy bear we're great I'm gonna enjoy this while lack sour patch kids I'm gonna enjoy this [Music] mmm sour oh my goodness can you believe it how does this contain nine million schoolgirls I'm so scared I'm literally like scared all right next up we have some life savers I need this to save my life mmm last but not least on the gummies break them we got gummy worms was complete now time for the real deal the one chip gummy bear challenge first things first we got the pepto-bismol hmm it helps if you want to do some spiciness it helps to drink pepto-bismol like 30 minutes before so that's what I did for the main event let's open this gummy bear huh huh just like this Oh Oh oh my gosh look at that look at this oh yes oh I feel like they literally took a whole bunch of like plutonium hot sauce melted it that's not a good smell I can tell you that hey oh it's so crazy how that little thing can pack so much of a punch you know like it's not still gets is all oil that's it this is all spicy oil okay that's what makes it intense I feel like you take a whole bunch of extracts from the ghost peppers and Carolina Reapers and put it into that tiny teddy bear alright everybody this is the one gummy bear just to let you know it's not fake it's literally a gummy bear with the dynamite that's how we know 3 2 1 you're here the juices [Music] it's like I'm literally eating hot sauce you take a whole bunch of hot sauce and you eat it that's what it feels like I'm doing right now [Music] okay yeah this is good my tongue is burning that's the only sensation that's that's effective it yes yes yeah I'm feeling it yeah it's good at it it takes a while but then like oh hi my goal there's so last couple minutes without taking milk or ice oh this is bad dude like I feel like it's stuck in my tongue like all the starch and like all the sugar I guess it's just stuck in my tongue like glue that's crazy how that small gummy bear did this much to me I'm like this much bigger than the gummy bear oh yeah oh the good one that's a good one that was a good baby that was a good baby that was good baby that was a good baby bear it's getting worse it always happens every time I breathe it gets worse Wow look at me yeah can you see the pain can you see the pain huh can you see the pain in my eyeball I'm sorry this is disgusting but I did this for you can we get this video to 77 likes I bet you we can't oh my gosh dude hey girl I gotta tell you the truth though I'm doing good without milk I don't believe that is 9 million scovilles because I feel like the one chip was a lot spicier but it does hurt it just does hurt I will never eat uh know that gummy bear fear in my life dude that was absolutely disgusting and gross I'm gonna get some milk my stomach is in pain ah geez that felt a lot better oh dear all right cool I feel a lot better I mean not a hundred percent but that was pretty

easy\nand healthy vegan jelly sweets. They were all set with agar agar and it's pretty\nmuch the same recipe for them but I'm showing you different variations and how\nto make it. I have in some of them use a speciality mold but in others just use\nthe normal square dish and slice them up to make shapes so you don't really need any\nspeciality equipment to make this. I'm using agar agar powder here rather than\nthe bars and flakes it's the most potent form and I always recommend to use\nagar agar powder. The basic recipe is one heaped tablespoon of agar agar\npowder with one cup or 240 milliliters of liquid and then simmer for a\ncouple of minutes. They are easy to make but one place people can go wrong is by\nnot stirring the pan enough. So you really want to make sure you stir\nconstantly for the whole time in a figure of 80 so 8 then 0 just to make\nsure no a you agar sticks to the bottom of the pan. If it does sticks is bottom\npan then you often don't get enough agar agar mixture combined so\nthey might not set properly. My favorite is the fruit juice jelly sweets just\nbecause they look great with all the different colors and it's a perfect way\nto use that fruit fruit that's a bit past its best.

enormous gummy worm almost four feet long i'm eating this and it's sour it's just making me salivate it's hard to talk i'm just letting it happen following the trend of the three pound gummy worm we're going to take things up to over four feet long and so here you can see we've got a piece of corrugated pipe and this is where we're going to be making our gummy worm in so it'll be about four inches tall over four feet wide did you dip this in extra malic acid malic acid is a sour powder that's often used in sour candies oh you actually tried it yeah i didn't think that was gonna happen i was gonna take one for the team to try it but he just went for it oh wow that's sour guys real sour all right so here's the idea we're going to prep our corrugated tube yep then we're going to start making our gelatin candy and we're just going to fill we're going to do the red and blue variety so we've got some red jello some blue jello our corn syrup and we've got some gelatin we're just gonna be making the normal recipe and we're gonna fill the two sides with the red and the blue we've got some domes these were like christmas ornament make your own christmas ornaments come into handy so many times we actually use these in uh the giant skittles they're a great size they're just gonna fit right on the side here we're going to use hot glue to attach them which should be great this recipe works really well if you're trying to get a very clear pour on stuff by just letting it sit removing all the bubbles skimming it and if you really want you can like pour it into a glass and let it cool down and cut off we don't actually need it to be perfectly clear none of these gummy sour worms that we have are clear so if it has a little bit of opacity to it that's not a problem for us all right while we're getting that gummy cooking we want to show you some crates that we got from kiwico guys these are amazing kits especially if learning at home is better for you now these kits come with everything that you're going to need for the month's project so you're not going to have to have any additional runs to the store to get supplies guys these kits are fantastic my niece and my nephews absolutely love these and they build them every month i've put a few of them together myself and i gotta say even for me they're kind of fun stuff to play with guys kiwico makes amazing holiday gifts if you want to get your first month free head on down to the description and click the link there or go to kiwico.com [Music] tkor [Music] [Music] i like it all right this is fantastic and it's a lot of heat so we're gonna just let this cool until tomorrow yeah we did it it's been overnight this is set it's nice and nice and solid gummy i mean it's squishy but it's solidified squishy not liquid squishy all right let's see if we can actually get this to peel apart yeah [Music] oh my gosh this is ridiculous yeah [Laughter] gummy worm gummy worm oh no oh yeah oh that looks so good oh my god what color variation we have the malic acid we gotta make it sour this is ridiculous all right i'm very happy with our results of our gummy worm i admit we could have gone with something to add opacity to it and then it would look more like it when i first thought giant gummy worm my thought was like the clear gummy worms that aren't like the sour ones i was looking at the giant ones i was like oh they have like a sour giant one that's even better so i got that we didn't change our recipe for that but i'm still very happy with it it is a giant gummy worm that's fantastic i want to do taste tests oh well that surface acid it's not identical but it's similar it really is pretty much the same as like normal gummy worms the clear kind of boy matt flower gets you it will right about now it's so good well we've got our giant gummy worm and we need to put it to a couple tests for strength so i want to grab one end of it and just spin around in a circle and see how well it holds together first i want to see if we can both like how far we can stretch it oh it's so oh the malic acid just dissolves gooey outside i don't think we'll be able to hold on to it well enough to tear it let's try i don't want it i just want to see if it's oh it's straight it is stretching and my hands are like just sliding down all right you want to just swing this thing around i do i do i want to just okay we've got a tear right there so well that might be where it tears oh 21 pound gummy worm here goes [Music] no no no no no no no no it's gross wait i'm gonna try this side i actually don't think i can lift it that way here this part's gonna tear off and then it will weigh less there it is and it's covered in grass now yeah all right the only way i can hold on to it was by digging my hands into it stabbing it yes that didn't work so well yeah [Music] i want to see if we can swing and smack the pieces of gun like a sword fight oh your your weapon's falling apart if i can tear to an inside part i'll take a bite out of it i can't and it's covered in it's actually remarkably tear resistant there we go that's just inside part it's bite resistant gross it's hard to bite your injury you're right high five yeah i hated that i'm gonna try and toss it do it oh it worked kind of thought it was just going to stick does if i do a little toss it sticks okay i think i'm i'm tapping out it's getting stickier i can't i'm dressed i'm done i'm i'm out here you go cow no no thank you again for today's sponsor kiwi code guys if you want to get your own kiwi coke kits head down

Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today I really wanted to make a Nerdy Nummies themed treat And lately I have been eating a lot of like fruit snacks and gummy candy, so I thought, let's put these two things together. So today, we're gonna be making Nerdy Nummies Gummies to do so I'll be using the Nerdy Nummies mold It's got a cute little smart cookie logo, 8-bit heart and a little dino. Oh! Also, I'm using the cherry gummy mix from my baking line I'll put links down below to both of these if you're interested or you can use whatever Gummy recipe you'd like alright... LET'S GET STARTED! Making these gummy treats is super easy mode, The things you'll need will be: Half a cup of water, one box of gummy mix and two molds I'm using two molds because the box of gummy mix fills two of them and then half the box would fill one Let's put it all together! To make these Nerdy Nummy Gummies, the first step: combine your water and mix into a Heat Safe Bowl Whisk together until well combined. Now It's time to heat it up! Take it over to the microwave and heat for 90 seconds, then remove from the microwave, give it a quick stir, Then place it back in the microwave for another 60 seconds You'll know, it's done when the top is bubbling. Once your gummy mix is ready, pour it into something with a good pour spout I'm gonna be using this small bowl in my baking line cuz it has a really good pour spout and before you pour your mixture into the cavities, lightly grease them, then slowly pour ur gummy mix into each cavity of the mould. And don't worry if you spill a little like I did you can take a little damp paper towel, wipe it up, OR, or just leave it after it sets You can just peel it off and have another little snack. He Hee! And just a helpful tip if your gummy mix starts to cool while you're working with it You can just pour it back into a heat safe container and pop it in the microwave for a few Seconds once you pour in all the gummy mix it's time to chill! Pop these in refrigerator for one hour and then I'm Gonna watch whatever my favorite Netflix show is! Once they've completely set and chilled in the fridge it's time to pop them out! What I like to do is give your mold a tug at the top and bottom and on the Sides then push from the bottom and pop your gummies out Look at that! I picked up all of the detail, Looks adorable! the first ones for me Mm-Hmm these days, just like my grandma's cherry candies. I love them now. Just keep popping out the rest of your gummies and TADAAA!!!! Here are the nerdy nummies gummies that we made today not only is this treat super easy mode? But I just love that you can see all of the detail look at how detailed these little cookies are and the dinosaur Adorable I'll be posting a bunch of pictures and the instructions on Rosanna Pansino Com Facebook Instagram and Twitter so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these gummies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations Especially with their nerdy nummies themed it really really makes my day if you like this video make sure to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my YouTube channel and if you have any other ideas for any other nerdy nummies Please let me know leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen also if you're interested in the mold or the gummy mix we use today I'll Put links down below alright. Thanks a lot. You guys bye. Bye", "gDR451h2dt4": "I'm assuming you don't need an intro because obviously by the title we're making Gentiles so you got cheapest alcohol you can buy and five dollars of lemonade mix why is this the best solution to jungle juice it's because your main ingredient is water a long time ago I went looked up all of the recipes that people are making online and they're trying to get all fancy they dump it in like popsicles and fruit and ice cream it's like who has the money for that chances are if you're making jungle juice you're in college or you still 40 bucks from your mom and you're throwing a house party this one's five bucks aside from the alcohol they fight it kinda adds up back in college my sophomore year we started throwing house parties and me and my roommates quickly realized that we needed a jungle juice that does stain the carpet was super cheap and somehow tasted good you really need a jungle juice that doesn't stain because people are wasted halfway through the party so you got Trisha just slapping everybody's cup out of their hand then you just look like a peasant on the floor you know scrubbing your carpets stress and now you don't wanna stress during a party so every time a cup flies out of someone's hand or off the table you just don't have to care about it it's basically just water and a light pink color you're not really working with red green or blue over here so let's start [ __ ] around so first you dump in 15 to 16 liters of water there should be a marker on your five gallon that's gonna nice I was about to do that backward so you want to toss your alcohol at first because the lemonade mixes with alcohol you dump that in right I'm having like PTSD I bought citrus you could buy normal vodka you know not flavored but either one works so you want to dump two handles in there three liters in total then when you're done with that you take your lemonade mix and you dump that [ __ ] in you're good to go actually you need to stir it I actually use a bottle now don't throw the bottle on the ground and now all we have left to do is toss the ice in so it's really important to throw the ice in last because I was at a party once this girl comes up to me and she's like you're in charge of the jungle juice and I was like yeah but I didn't make this bad why she was like this literally tastes like water I was like all right the main ingredients water but shouldn't taste like water I try it and I'm like this is literally water so I go up to the jungle juice I look in it it's just a bunch of ice floating at the top and then sitting on top of it is a huge pile of lemonade powders so I turned my friend who made it and I'm like why didn't you stir it you're supposed to stir of lemonade cuz Leone I just shook it I was like bro how do you mess that up get one job and that is a full batch of jungle juice for like five bucks and then if you want ice to be a nice person it's an extra 250 so in total this is 750 plus alcohol this cheap as it gets yeah so the name of it is pink drink I totally ripped it off the Starbucks refresher called pink drink it's a catchy name okay it honestly tastes good it's kind of hoping there's not grass in this [Music]", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I

back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "ypfpU6O4CV4": "hi welcome back into my kitchen i'm holly morrison with the goshen team and we are here to do a requested video from our viewers so i think i mentioned somewhere along the line that i've made gummy bears before and i have oh it seems like it's something we do periodically like we'll at least do it once a year for several months and then we burn out and we do something different so but our viewers were asking for some gummy bear recipes so we've been tinkering and my kids have been helping me in the kitchen and we have come up with three recipes that i'd like to share with you today this is the first of three recipes this one is a lemon pucker gummy and what is um healthy about this gummy it's loaded with vitamin c naturally because we're going to use the lemon and the lemon zest of our organic lemons um and it's loaded with collagen so and they're cute as heck and your kids are going to wear them out now i typically in my home um default to sugar-free it's just easier because there's plenty of times when we visit and we get sugar so we're going to be using monk fruit today and i have been using this in my kitchen now for a while just to kind of get the groove on i've used it with blends i don't like the blend ones because there's always some kind of compromise there's always a little ingredient there that's just not so great so this one's 100 pure monk fruit organic and it's really doing a good job it's not as sweet as stevia and we're used to stevia but i have a lot of friends that they just happen to have that gene where they hate stevia so i wanted to make sure we kind of try some other things now of course you can do any sugar that you want you can use a sugar substitute like this you can use manuka honey which would do great it's going to definitely add a different taste it's going to taste more honey because these recipes are super concentrated so when you add honey to it it's definitely going to be a little bit different and i'll put that in the recipe below the variation that you'll do because you'll pull back a little bit of your liquid when you're adding another liquid in because once that dissolves it's going to be a liquid all right and you want your gummies to be gummy so that's our goal we want them to taste good we want them to be healthy and here we go we're going to jump in this is my lemon pucker one okay so this one i would love to show you and i'm just going to kind of work them a little bit to get these juicy um but my family ate them all um this was definitely the favorite the second favorite was the tarte cherry one that had elderberry in it so that was really good and you can add we're going to put elderberry in one of our recipes but you can add that elderberry syrup and it does have a little bit of sugar but it is organic and that just ends up being part of your sweetener so you just don't add much else as far sweetener goes you can add that to any of these recipes but this one we're showcasing the lemon and we're going to zest it because tenfold the nutrition is in that lemon like just doing this my hands smell amazing so this is our juicer i highlighted that in a different video i'm not sure if that one's come out yet but this is a great little lemon juicer so we're going to start with zesting and we're going to do the zest of both of these oranges and if you get a little bit of the white that's okay that's called the pith the bitters be careful this is like a gazillion little uh razors that are down here so i have been zesting for decades um i love zest my gallbladder loves zest our bodies love zest um so you know be careful don't get hurt and i am that girl i like to get every little bit of the lemon and i haven't cut myself in a long time but if i'm in a super big hurry and i'm trying to microplane some garlic isn't that beautiful i wish you could smell that it's just the bob.com all right so we're going to do our other lemon and then we're going to juice them and that's going to make up the bulk of the liquid so before we juice them we're going to get some water in a bowl and we're going to bloom our gelatin and that's the key thing to make gummies is you've got to bloom your gelatin and you've got to do it properly so we're going to heat up part of our liquid so that we can add our bloom gelatin in and that's what activates it and makes it just nice and shiny and pretty and if you do it carefully you won't have any weird bubbles because sometimes you can get bubbles okay so that's it we're going to juice that we're going to put all of that zest into this bowl and then we're going to juice those and put that in there also but right now we're going to add a couple of ounces and i'm going to use this because it's just it's got a little measuring tool so i'm going to measure off a couple ounces of water that's one ounce that's two ounces and a tiny bit over so put that back in and we're going to put in some of our let me grab i want to get any lemon zest in okay so we are glancing just to make sure i'm remembering yep yep so we're gonna put in one serving of gelatin actually i'm gonna do a serving and a half so i'm gonna do a tablespoon and these little measures exactly a tablespoon so i'm gonna do a tablespoon and a half because we're gonna do two lemons and that's gonna produce at least two ounces of liquid and the cool thing about gelatin and and i didn't really like to show you up close but let me show you up close if you do this right it makes little waves you see the little waves looks like the ocean and you want to put this on there lightly so you're dusting it on like if you just drop this all in the middle you're going to get a clump and i mean you probably could redeem it but it's pretty much going to be a waste so that's going to sit there and bloom is what they call it and it just means we're hydrating the gelatin um put our lid back on over here for a moment okay now we're going to juice our lemons so we're just going to cut them and this little juicer is so nifty it comes apart so when your seeds get in there you can just take it apart tap your seeds back on the counter and keep on going so and the cool thing about this juicer is it fits in your hand perfect and it gets all the juice i mean kid you not there is no juice left in that lemon when you are done and i love that it measures so that you don't have to put it in something else so i mean there's nothing left of that and it just fits in your hand perfectly and i love lemons lemons and my body get along great now i probably yep i'm going to use all of it no matter what hold on let me just see where we're at yeah that was a little bit over so that was probably about an ounce and a half so that that line right there says an ounce and it was just a tiny bit over there's maybe like an eighth of a teaspoon there so that's an ounce and a half and that's the beauty of this you just when you're using real ingredients sometimes a lemon doesn't do what you expect it to do now this one has a lot of seeds so this one's probably not going to do near as much juice this one had like no seeds and it made a mountain of juice this one's making hardly none now my seeds i probably should have gathered yep it's almost there hold on this one has a lot of pulp that's coming through yeah there we go nifty oh my gosh i love this thing all right and then we're gonna do the last of it and this was my family's favorite yes it's a labor of love it is i'm not joking but my um my six-year-old is not a giant fan of collagen in any form but boy she loves this and she did like the other one too so we're gonna do the other flavor also all right it might spill a little so i'm gonna open it yep that one's actually right at about a little over an ounce and then all you do to get your seeds out is you just tap it on here and it's clean and it's ready to go for the next time you need lemon so now i'm going to actually pull back a little bit of this because our other two recipes call for a tablespoon mmm hold on i thought i had a dish we'll just use that one we're going to pull out and it's just to make it more tart so that'll be for our other recipes all right so now what we're going to do is put all this together now we have to get our sweetener in and the key is how does it taste once it's cooled out so we're going to combine these and as you can see this is pretty dusty a little bit on top so what i'm going to do is take a little bit of my lemon juice and put it on top and we're going to work it around because we want all that dustiness to go away we want this to be shiny which means it's completely bloomed there we go and we can put a little more liquid on them this is all going to end up going into our saucepan [Music] there we go let me grab my spoon and here is our sauce pan now we're still going to add our sweetener we're adding a liquid in with all that amazing zest all right and then here is our bloom gelatin which is like just like a wedge of jello and it's going in and then we're going to go to the stove and we're going to very gently heat this we don't want it bubbling or simmering we just want to once that jello is dissolved turn it off take it off the burner and we're going to let it cool a little bit and get it in our little squeezy bottles all right so i've turned my stove on to like a medium high so you have little chunks and they're just dissolving they're just it melts just like butter see how that's just turning into hardly nothing and that's pretty much done so i'm going to give it about 10 more seconds because i don't want any lumps and even though we've bloomed it this is the completion of the blooming process so if you don't bring it to heat then you do not have gelatin all we're doing now is adding our sweetener um i added 15 drops of the monk fruit we're going to count it out real quick all right i think we're there now please taste make sure it tastes good to you don't just do my recipe and our family doesn't eat a lot of sugar so we're not used to a lot of sweetness so that might not be enough sweetness for you or you may want to do honey in this okay so the other thing is too that there's a variation to this that you can you can do with orange you could do any citrus kid you not but you can also add a couple of teaspoons of magnesium calm and you've now turned your gummy into a magnesium supplement so a couple of teaspoons is the serving i wouldn't put more than two teaspoons in this volume because it would just overpower it and you could go orange you could do orange zest and orange all the way through just make sure you're tasting it before you put it in your mold because once it goes in the mold it's the flavor will slightly concentrate but it won't get better it will only be about the same so just make sure it's tasty to you right now but that's a wonderful way to add magnesium to it all right so what we're going to do now is we're going to take our cooled down liquid um and we're going to put it in this cute little squeezy bottle yes the affiliate link will be below um and it's the good plastic yes there's like letters to it we're not going to worry about that we all know that holly sometimes mix up letters so we're just not even going to go there so these are adorable i've already broken them in we have some other molds but they were not the healthier plastic so we want the healthier so we just keep trying we keep improving so we're going to take this and transfer it into here you'll see why in a minute i'm going to show you how to do this this little guy right here comes with your mats and you're gonna fill it up and it's my kids did it they thought it was awesome using this little squeezy thing personally i do not want to fill up a dropper for all gazillion of those cute little bears so i'm going to take mine and i'm going to put it in my little nifty squeezy bottle and i love these things i use them for all kinds of stuff i think this is a four ounce bottle so that means we really did the recipe correct because that's your goal is you want to keep your overall liquid correct otherwise the amount of gelatin you put in will not work and instead of gummy bears you made jello so here we go now we do have zest in here so you want to kind of keep it mixed up now watch this uh-huh don't you agree it's worth buying these little inexpensive squeezy bottles and i think it comes in eight count trust me you'll find something else to do with it i have this is my last two bottles so i'm like i'm gonna be ordering some more of these and look how quick all right now we obviously took a lot of time on this batch the next batch we're not gonna spend as much time and do every little bit hold on i'm just taking a little out of that one too all right so what we're going to do is i'm going to put that in my freezer to let it set up so that you can see us taking them out of the molds and honestly once they're done you don't need to worry about what to do to keep them from going bad because your family is going to wear them out and they're going to be gone so i'm going to tuck these in the freezer and we're going to come back and make the tart cherry elderberry ones all right we are jumping into our final recipe this one by landslide everybody loved so nobody didn't like the lemon because they were all gone but it was the first recipe i made but i still think it was my favorite but once we made this everybody was like this is amazing so our um our main ingredient is gonna be organic tart cherry concentrate delicious great for your body great for cardiovascular health it helps you sleep promote sleep anybody that you know that's struggling with out they often talk about cherries putting frozen cherries that are in your smoothie or to get the concentrate or cherry juice but you want the tart cherry which is delicious so it just makes us such a sour gummy so it's so yummy yummy yummy you're gonna love it it has a little bit of sugar but it's just natural sugar because it's super concentrated um the other thing we're gonna add is black elderberry syrup which is great for fighting viruses so this is your ounce of prevention so you're consuming these daily they're just great for keeping your immune system ready for winter handling winter great all of the above all right so we're gonna go ahead and get our water in here i'm going to use this cute little measuring guide because it just keeps me on track and we're going to have three ounces of water with this so it's a little bit more volume overall um and i probably will actually have more than what i can fill up in here but those pop out super fast and i'll just put the rest and the rest of the gummies that way so all right so we're going to go ahead and bloom two tablespoons of gelatin with this one all right so this is just going to sit for a moment while we pull the rest of our ingredients together all right so what we're adding now and shake this for sure is we're gonna add um three tablespoons let me check because i wrote it all down no four tablespoons yup i added an extra tablespoon at the end that smells so good all right and then we're going to do one tablespoon of this elderberry concentrate and a serving of this is a teaspoon so needless to say you're fine if your kids have a bunch of gummies all right and then put my lid over here we're going to get our lemon juice in all right and then we're actually going to add just a tiny bit more water but not much and then the sweetener is to taste i would put about 10 more drops in even though this has sweetener in it naturally i mean it's just cherries have sugar and this one does have an added sweetener to it so now what we're going to do is we've got to get our dust off the top same thing as we did last time so that's just about there what we're going to do is going to put everything in our saucepan and we're going to do a gentle heat up now we're going to get all this in our bottle look at that color not pretty the taste matches the color it's delish you do not want on your clothes though all right so yeah i told you this one's going to be a tiny bit more and of course you let it cool before you put it in your bottle even though these are healthier plastics i still don't like to put anything hot on a plastic so this is going to go in my freezer and only just so i can speed up the process you really could just put it in your fridge and honestly they'll congeal on the counter all righty we have got gummy bears galore and we're going to have some happy kids happy parents because they're going to have to share some so these are the ones that we made last night they're kind of cute and now i'm going to show you how to get these little babies out so these were done first because we did them first so you're just going to push from the bottom your kids are great for this and if you don't have kids then you get to do it now these are the lemon pucker ones these are the orange ones that i was telling you about so they look a little different in color um if you love lemon you're going to love these your kids are not going to go for this i'm just telling you and like i said they will dehydrate a little bit and they get even tastier so if you leave them open on a plate in your fridge in my house that doesn't mean they're safe but if they actually could stay there for a couple of days they get less wet and they dry out and then they the flavor all the flavor does is concentrate so i'm chewing up a gummy and it wasn't broken so i had no excuse but golly thanks for coming into our kitchen thanks for checking out our recipe on how to collagen load in a fun way

you", "515GSjc9Tvo": "let's make homemade gummy bears one three ounce packet of flavor jello one packet of unflavored gelatin and a quarter teaspoon citric acid stir to combine then add a quarter cup corn syrup and a third cup of water stir gently with a soup spoon then let this sit for five minutes microwave this on and off for about a minute and 15 seconds fill up your oiled gummy bear mold and let it rest for half an hour then place it in the fridge for half an hour push the gummy bears from their mold then let them sit upright for 48 hours and once your gummies have been well rested you'll end up with these perfect beautiful gummy bears i mean come on how cool are these eh i still like jelly beans better", "n3_dV-e4d9c": "For this video, I\u2019m going to show you how\nto take a few simple ingredients, and make mountains and mountains of your own custom\ngummy candies, at home. Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com", "rCeiPkJI27E": "hi y'all so today we are gonna be making some super fun super healthy gummy bears I love food that you know what times we just want a snack you just want the mouthfeel and the action of the hand-to-mouth without all the calories you don't want it to feel guilt about it you don't have to worry about gaining weight and you know it's comfort eating but foods that are so great for this and bread to find that's why I love things like gummy bears because if done correctly they can be a super locale fun snack that you don't have to feel guilty about so the first thing we're going to do is I'm going to juice up some fruit and vege I like to put some veggies in the gummies for those extra nutrients and also it's less sugar content in the juice so we're going to be juicing one apple half a lemon 1/3 of a cucumber 3 carrots and 3 pieces of kale and again anytime I'm juicing I'm going organic because I don't want a concentrated level of pesticides in my juice pesticides they do penetrate the skin and so they are in the entire body of the fruit and vegetable so just rinsing it or skimming it isn't good enough it's always better to go organic so I'm gonna juice this and then we will show you the rest of how to make the gummies all right so I've got my fruit and veggie juice here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to divide this roughly in half that does not need to be an exact measurement but it's really important when you're making gummies to let the gelatin bloom I use the Great Lakes gelatin be sure to use in Great Lakes to get the kind of reddish orange bottle not the green container I did not know this no one said it hits and I tried four times to make these gummies and they would not said they would not gel you know why and then I read in an obscure blog somewhere that I finally came across that the green gelatin doesn't gel for greatly so it has to be this orange bottle so I'm going to add three tablespoons of the gelatin into my cool mixture you need to let it bloom if you add the gelatin to a hot mixture it clumps together and you're not going to get a nice smooth even texture you can some people add the gelatin in and then heat and make sure the gelatin is in but the thing is is if you go above 165 your denaturing the gelatin and I don't really want to be getting a little specific with this so I'm just going to put it in the blender here it's important to mix it together really well because I don't want any clumps in my gummy bears and I found that with the gelatin [Music] [Music] so basically I'm gonna let it set and let it start absorbing the liquid there with the remaining liquid because you do need it's a mixture of hot and cold really to make them so I'm gonna take the second half of my liquid pour it in a saucepan on the burner here and I'm just gonna heat it up to simmering it doesn't mean to be a rolling boil you don't want it to be a rolling boil but if you get it up to a nice good simmer and then you gradually mix it in with your cool mixture then what happens is you get the heat you need without overheating with gelatin I don't have to go and take the measure of it you can make these juice gummies without any added sweetener at all I made them and they don't have a bad taste they're very bland the juice even though the juice is nice and sweet when you start trying to make it into the gummies and the gummies have set it ends up but just not having a lot of flavor and I want these to be really nice and fun to eat and feel like a treat so what I did is you can use either honey or something like monks fruit I want the monk fruit things I'm just trying to keep them as a low-calorie as possible their thing was something like monks food stevia anything that makes with your rapier tall they need to be aware of is when there is more I like a liquid suspension versus a dough even if you make a simple syrup out of it the crystals reform in the refrigerator so because of that what I did I just took about 1/4 of a cup and I put it into my coffee grinder and I ground her back as a confectioner sugar which is extremely fine so that I don't have I don't want me to get me very pretty and really the the exact amount that you're not using the monks fruit for the to do anything with the texture or the consistency all you're using it for is to add a little bit of sweetness to your juice without adding more calories with you no sugar honey so I'm just going to let this simmer and as soon as I see the bubbles forming on the top we're gonna combine it with our cool mixture and get it into our mold all right so now that I've got a nice simmer on this rod I'm just going to remove the mixture from the heat and put it back into my kitchen but I don't do nature and overwhelm the gelatin okay now I'm gonna turn on a bit higher and get a really good mix on this again we don't we don't want clumpy pretty nasty gonna bear [Music] okay so that should be good and what we're gonna do now is I have my little silicon gummy bear mold definitely use the silicon because you don't want something that they're going to stick to that is tricky to their cute little shape and now a lot of people use these tongue with a dropper that you can use the dropper to fill the gummies to me that takes my mixture starts to thicken while I'm dropping it and I don't get the even smooth texture I'm looking for so all I'm gonna do is I'm going to slowly pour the mixture to encourage the liquid down into the mold so that it's filling the gummy bear is instead of just resting on top when these molds are filled I'm gonna use a cookie sheet so that they don't to carry them so that the liquid doesn't come out of the mold and slop everywhere put him on a cookie sheet put him in the fridge let him sit for about two hours and then put him in the freezer for 15 minutes the freezing just helps them to be hard enough that you can pop them out of the mold without damaging them Hey so it's been a couple hours and the gummy bears are ready to go super exciting so you see they're in the move like this and what you want to do when you're breaking out of the mold is go from the side don't go from the middle because I found if you push from the middle it tends to split him in half he goes on the side they pop right out and get a little gummy bear it's really nice Mottola sweet you don't have to taste the vegetable you just know it's a veggie juice because they're green if you want a more vibrant green you can use the natural food coloring so I'm just popping about one by one then put them in this storage container I do keep them in the fridge at least I want to eat them because the fridge they aren't grocery store bought they're not quite as firm because they don't have all the additives and they keep their they have a nice like a firmer texture basically out of the fridge they can't be out for about an hour at a time if you want to take a bag given with you but overall long-term storage I keep them in the fridge so I hope that you found this recipe informative check out the full recipe at skinny minx calm let me know if you have any

baskin all right guys bye you", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "Yh8snA5aqMk": "I'm gonna be obvious you guys like seven-year-old Dan would be super impressed with how much I just spent on candy what's up everybody today I'm back in the kitchen that's are constantly saying one of two things one when are you gonna be back in the kitchen damn and to never go back to the kitchen man yeah I'm a little sick right now that's why I might sound like this so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a bunch of gummy bears melt them down to make a mega gummy bears first off I got a teddy bear mold rented this yeah I didn't know you could read stuff what I'm like hi there can I get the teddy bear mold no like you want to buy it or do you want to rent what you can rent it so I actually am renting this currently for a dollar ninety-nine a day they didn't have the traditional like gummy bear one so I'm going with this guy four different bags of gummy bears we got green we got red we got yellow and we got blue now I want to show you guys something because I know this is gonna come up this will reuse in a day okay you guys are probably thinking I thought it was like a little gummy bear this is the same material as those little gummy bears traditional stereotype gummy bears that you guys are probably thinking of I was originally at knows the ladies like so what are you doing this was like one of the few times is actually honest through the store associate I'm like I'm gonna develop these data like a huge bear Valachi she's the bigger wise girl Lucy he ate a sack same song with these guys plus it was easier to separate the colors that way so let's go over to the stove and let's melt actually before we do that guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and click the bail free for a limited time right now my subscriptions are educating they're always pretty good guys subscribe my channel let's go okay so to my understanding we got to fill up the pot first and then we're gonna put the bowl in like that and that's gonna kind of heat it up this is a bad idea are we not blocking the air from getting now I'm gonna use a bigger pot I think his bigger brother well I forgot to mention you've got no idea what I'm doing go ahead and turn that up to full okay let's let that boil so we're gonna start off with the red ones okay so it looks like what you've successfully melted a bunch of gummy bears suffer that clump we know this melt a little bit more and we're gonna pour the first layer in our mole I know things get stuck way easier than you think so I'm just gonna put some vegetable oil I don't know if the gummies gonna stick yeah like this is gonna help it's pretty much fully melted looks like sweet and sour sauce here we go now we're gonna do is take this put it in the freezer well that's cooling we're actually gonna start melting the other colors alright next we're gonna do blue I want the bottom of you more blue which is why I poured it we will see down there for our third color we got green that's weird already seems to be melting we can't let water get in there I don't know why but this is so satisfying like the Bears aren't fully melted well you just like stab right through them unless not least yellow my favorite flavor I have favorite color do your thing yellow all right that's three layers in our bear mold the last one is gonna be yellow I better this perfectly look at that I didn't know how much incoming bears together like what the quantity would be when you melt it down but damn that I nail it okay we're gonna let it freeze for about an hour you come back and check on it freeze well my job okay it's been like two hours or like more than that let's see this bad boy oh my god this thing is perfect oh my god it is so stuck to this pan no this feels wrong why does this feel so sexual right now Oh oh my god look at that we even got the face okay stop for sure get to clean my windows after this but it is currently stuck to my window [Music] this thing is so sticky this is a mega gummy bear which is what we've done by melting other gummy bears it's like the Optimus Prime of gummy bears right here yeah I don't know it's her strategy to cutting gummy this is doing nothing oh look at the layers look at the layers beautiful red we've got blue we've got green and then BOOM yellow it's actually really nicely done that is the negev gummy out with sliding already that's the mega gummy bear it's literally the size of my face actually bigger than my face hey it takes you 20 minutes to melt every color of gummy bear it takes like 2 hours to fully cool and on top of that it's loaded with sugar it's now becoming a health nut it was fun it was something I wanted to try for a long time I was so amazed at how well these gummy bears actually melted if you guys want to see a really good picture of this on Instagram follow me at the autocracy scribe my channel if you haven't and I'll see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "RGSpXJxvwvE": "[Music] raspberry flavorless [Music] [Music] juice [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]

mark summers sorting through lots of halloween treats how about gummies they're a standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "7Oi6U2aYxqg": "world's largest gummy haha holy

"tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "xBdQVDXh0Rw":

We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay. (laughing) - But I'm going to call\nhim Denas when I see him. It's Sundance. - So that's the only famous\nDenis you could find on Google? All right, so you've marinated some stuff. Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about. Oh, this is also a smoor, which means it is a Good Mythical More that was voted on by the Mythical Society. And what you guys have\ndecided that we should do is readily, are sprayed with water every time they touch their hair or beard. This was suggested by\nGinger Snaps, not the brand, the mythical beast. - The majority of you\nvoted on that suggestion. And, but the, the, I mean-- - I don't touch. I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess. Cause I don't want to\neat too many gummies. - I can't tell, all I taste is gummy bears and they're good. - [Stevie] You want a\nthree, two, one on it? You really, you don't\nhave any kind of guess? It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking? (background laughs) - [Stevie] What? - What? - I wasn't listening to\nwhat you were saying. - It's not something-- - [Stevie] This soda has\nbeen featured on this show in a prominent way in this recent season. It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX.

It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick.

dark chocolate ganache filling they're so good oh my gosh they're only available for a limited time and we do ship internationally so if you would like a box definitely check out the link in the description box down below hello everybody welcome back so as you may see I have a little guest here today that enthusiam camera and so today we are making some gummy bears for dogs and this is part of my little Paddington's pantry series because this if you look at the camera is Paddington my Pomeranian and every so often at me makes and dog friendly treats so today we are making some coming ears and I didn't know that dogs could eat gelatin for the longest time and once I heard that that was possible I'm like oh my gosh this needs to happen for you too so we are making a lot of element gummy bears today but actually not bears they are a little like bone shape how cute is this mold I'll have them will link in the description box if you would like to check it out and before we get started I'll someone let you guys know that I have a member the only exclusive Facebook group that'll give you guys access or will allow you guys fix - um actually dictate what videos I film and give you guys a lot of creative control over this channel and over my chocolate shop on Etsy so if you wanna learn more about that I'll have that link in the description box below but without further ado let's get started and look at me bears and also in that group you'll get like behind-the-scenes photos and videos of Paddington's okay let's get started so first what you want to do is place two cups of fresh watermelon in a food processor and pulse until smooth show you to remove any pulp and then measure one cup of watermelon juice and so I'm using waggling in this video just because it's safe for dogs and it's like a nice kind of flavor for gummy bears that I recommend be using fresh fruit and it kind of this way versus using store-bought juice just because there's a lot of additives in store-bought juice like for humans and you don't necessarily know if there's an ingredient in there that could harm your dog there's a sweetener called xylitol off it on the screen here and that is so toxic three dogs so you definitely want to avoid anything with that and any kind of artificial sweetener so just to be safe I'd stick with fresh fruits or dogs safe beef broth beef broth I've purchased um beef broth powder from the pet store and it's safe for dogs there's no onion or garlic in it which is also toxic to dogs so before you decide to make experi dogs just do a quick Google and make sure that the ingredient that you're using like for the juice is animal friendly or dog friendly um one thing to really stay away from is any kind of juice that contains grapes or grape juice obviously those are so toxic for dogs oh my gosh so definitely stay away from that but I just recommend like call your vet or do a quick google before but watermelon is safe and paddington like I was sitting on the couch the other night and I was eating watermelon and he saw me and literally like dough onto me because he wanted it so badly so and you want to kill some gelatin into some water and microwave for 15 to 30 seconds or until it's liquid and it regards to the gelatin there's a lot of chatting in this video but you want to make sure that you that you're using a Knox gelatin which is plain unflavored unsweetened gelatin and don't use jell-o that like the job of box dip powder um that's because there are artificial sweeteners in that too and those aren't safe for your dog so just to be safe I'd recommend using thin box gelatin and I'll have that linked in the description box below and Amazon if you want to pick them up they want to pour the liquid gelatin into the watermelon juice and mix well or they make sure enjoyed gummy bear or Minnie bone mold and but into the fridge until it's set for about one to two hours let's unmold feed them to your puppy and are done that is so if it guys so much for watching these yummy should be stored in the fridge will probably last you around like four or five days just because gummies don't tend to like last as long as like the regular kind of like hard baked cookie and when they're at room temperature they soften up pretty quickly so I definitely recommend storing the fridge if you guys try these out please please please send us photos and take us at pink open e & pennington underscore calm on Instagram we would love to see what you make and always makes me so happy to see your creations and yeah please subscribe button entering the notification Bell so you notified on the upload because I upload every day from Monday to Friday and you will see a lot of Paddington so if you love dog friendly recipes and you like something some creative ones this is definitely the channel for you so yes thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you tomorrow for another video", "Za5IDVgRDto": "nutri pure vitamin C

is according to wikipedia a colourless translucent flavorless food derived from collagen the collagen comes from the skin connective tissue and bones of animals like pigs cattle fish and chicken but

elderberry looks like [Music] what's up youtube it's keisha and we are in the kitchen today we are going to be making cmos elderberry gummies so stick around for the recipe [Music] all right so in this bowl i have sea moss that i've already cleaned and soaked we soaked this cmos for 24 hours in spring water and then we cleansed it a little more with some lime juice i've poured the hot elderberry steep over the sea moss in order to activate the carrageenan in the sea moths for it to gel up once it cools ingredients we are going to be using cayenne pepper jamaican soursop cinnamon honey lemon juice and we're going to be spraying our gummy cavities with a little avocado while it's still hot i'm going to add half a cup of honey half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper cayenne pepper acts as black pepper would for ultimate antioxidant absorption i'm gonna do a fourth of a cup of lemon juice fourth cup of jamaican soursop and soursop is a fruit that's found in the caribbean and it is an immune boosting fruit that also helps fight cancer full of antioxidants overall just really good for the immune system and then we're going to do a teaspoon of cinnamon so these little gummies are gonna have a little kick to them packed full of immune boosting things make sure that honey gets dissolved [Music] all right so as you can see here the texture is already changing uh we're gonna go over to the blender and blend up the seam all that's in here and we're going to get a strain so we can start putting it into the gummy bear mold [Music] oh blended it right [Music] all right so now that we got it all blended up we're going to start dropping it into the gummy bones now that we've got these filled we are going to transport them to the refrigerator and let it cool and set up for however long they need to set up i'll let y'all know after time how long it took it's been about 30 minutes oh look at the little baby look at the little baby there we go so dark okay giant peppery okay come here what you think it's good it tastes good what else well give us a review we put it in your mouth it tastes like the elderberry made and then we start chewing it um they kind of taste like cinnamon rolls oh okay adrian what'd you think oh you know on this review whoa i shouldn't put that second one but it tastes good yeah you could but it's really spicy all right miss brandy what you think um good and it tastes like kind of delicious it tastes like banana that had that sugar on it oh um brown bananas okay thank you all right bye bye all right well here they are guys if y'all do decide to try these uh let me know how they turn out you'll definitely need to put a little oil over whatever mold you decide to use so they'll come out easily we didn't use gelatin so they're not as solid as they would be if they were actually gummy bears and we had you jokes and we used the sea moss which made it a certain texture but they still hold up well let this sit for about 30 minutes and this was the texture we got okay so last night we checked them after about 30 minutes they weren't as firm as i would have liked them to be so we left them in overnight and we're gonna go check them out now and see what they turned out to be so we're gonna pop them out and see what they look like if they've changed yeah they have gotten more firm i just smashed him i'm sorry it's like cranberry sauce really yeah you got it so did the consistency change i mean it firmed up more than it was last night to the touch but it still got the same texture as far as when you bite it got it okay depending on the firmness that you like you can probably use more cmos gel and it would or see moss and it would definitely make these a little more tighter but i think they're okay the way that they are we'll just pop them out of the molds as we you know take them so as far as the measurements that i used to make these i would say about five gummies for an adult and three four child no more than that per day and um yeah so that's it so if you watch this video all the way through i appreciate you be sure to comment your thoughts like this video and subscribe to the channel", "5ltYupLDW_w": "welcome to food fights and today you and I are going to trying these two brands of fruit snacks on the Left weighing in at 14 ounces is Welch's mixed fruit fruit snacks and on the right wing and at 17 point 6 ounces is much assorted fruit snacks so this is gonna be a very interesting video for me and you because I have never had any type of fruit snacks so this is a first time for me who knows I may just love these things but right away I noticed that the Welch's it's made with real fruit yeah made with real fruit whereas the mots are fruit flavored so I don't know if there's any real fruit in there or not but we're gonna find out but first let's see which one of these are the best values so for the welts as I paid 395 for this box and that works out to 28 cents an ounce and that gets us 28 fun-sized pouches as opposed to mots 22 regular pouches parent light mots pouches aren't near as fun as the Welch's pouches for the Mocs I also paid three dollars and 95 cents for this box but that works out to 22 cents an ounce so obviously the batter values with the mods not by a large margin but you do get more packages out of the Welch's then you do with the Mocs I would think these would be really convenient to throw in your lunchbox to take to work or in your tackle box to take fishing or on the boat or whatever how fun they are I don't know let's look at the ingredients of these and see actually what we're looking at here so we have fruit puree and that has all the different fruits in there and I'll show you all this if anybody wants to pause and look at this argument back out a little bit so let's take a look at the mots and see what we have in here first ingredient corn syrup so that's not looking real good right off the bat I do see that there's some real juice in there I got pear juicy apple juice sweet potato juice who knew that that was in there well this is actually sounding pretty interesting I don't know the whole sweet potato thing is kind of throwing me off so let's start off looking at the packages and I don't know I think I like the the more wispy text of the Welch's over the the classic box letters of the I think the wellses package this looks better another interesting thing though they're not actually showing the fruit snacks on the box of the Welch's they're just showing pieces of fruit while we know there's not pieces of fruit in here and at least with the Motta's they're showing you are giving a close facsimile I suppose of what there should be in these packages but as I always say what's most important is what's inside so let's open these up and see what in the world we are dealing with here so let's start with the Welch's and see what we have inside here opens up just like a box of cereal I think there's a prize inside yeah there's a prize inside it's these little packages or fruit snacks and there's actually a little smaller than I thought let's see how big this package is now Cheryl wait on here let's see 0.5 ounces or 14 grams for the Walters package I didn't know if there's like one package to be strawberry one package would be blue here the other package would be sweet potato see that they supposedly are our mixed fruit in here so that'll be interesting to see all right let's try the moths and see what we get here and also like a box of cereal this your plain old simple box reclosable box and let's pull this out and yeah also the bag literally is the same size I still like the packaging on the waltz is better that just looks better than the March that just looks very I don't know very dated to me how many ounces is this can you see I don't even I don't even know if it says how many ounces are on here let's check the box and see if it gives a weight 22.6 grams for the pouches so yes you're getting you're getting more where the waltz is is 14 grams you're getting 22 and a half grams as opposed to 14 grams with the Welch's so that's a huge difference right there maybe if your friend has the motch and you have the Welch's this guy's gonna be eating fruit snacks for a bit longer than you are all right let's open these up now and see what's inside so I'm gonna start with the Welch's and open this up let's see how easy this is to open because that's important for these things I would thinking wow these are not easy at all to open unless there's like a little tear thing I like a little perforation I think we're supposed to tear there normally I open things like that you've seen me open potato chips but we got that perforation so let's try the perforation oh yeah oh yeah that's how you're supposed to open these all right let's dump these out and have a look they smell good I'm small well I'm really surprised we got a very unusual mix well not unusual at all we've got more of one just a couple of the others that doesn't seem to be very random I don't know what flavor that's supposed to be that looks like strawberry and this is I don't know what that's supposed to be what do you think that's supposed to be this I'm gonna say is the blueberries or blackberries or mulberry or dingleberry so let's move these over and let's open up the mods and see how hard or easy these are to open I don't see anything special here to open but we do have this area to ditch so let's see you try open it that way yeah that went pretty good not as easy as the Welch's but that went pretty good so let's let's pour these out next to the Welch's and they certainly look different not as not quite as fruity looking except for the grapes the grapes look good I don't know what these and definitely has a different smell just from from smelling these just and I mean I'm probably a good two feet away from these I can smell these things and they smell quite good but they certainly look different which ones look better to you I mean the mots are more shiny and the Anna MAHT seem to be bigger so how many we got we got three six or seven there and we got six seven so you do get seven pieces for each package so I suppose since each package contains seven pieces you're not going to feel like you're getting ripped off I suppose but yes lamotte's fruit snacks are a little bit bigger than the Welch's the vaulters have better shapes to them the monsters look slightly bigger but they smell different when I open them the the Walsh is certainly had a difference smell which one smelled better all I missed one look at this I missed one it is laying beside the package so the mots has got at least this package the mots has got eight pieces in there so the welts fruit snag eater might be feeling left out but these things don't taste good then I'm gonna be feeling left out at all so we got quite a different colour that's nice to see a little bit of color contrast there I'm gonna start with the Welch's and try this strawberry what I think is strawberry and I'm gonna see how this tastes all right let's go off the wall Chisholm supposedly strawberry that's different tastes good I was surprised by the texture it was much much firmer than what I was expecting I guess I was expecting more of like what a gummy worm or a gummy bear or something like that that kind of a texture this had quite a bit stiffer texture than I was expecting but the taste is good is it taste great I don't know it's good there's a nice snack if you want a little sweetness after your your sandwich or something after your lunch that'd be a nice break from your Bologna or peanut butter sandwich all right let's see if I can oh now this looks like a strawberry here so this is what I'm assuming is the MOT strawberry or their facsimile of a strawberry fruit snack so let's see how this tastes better texture to me better texture Wow actually pretty darn good I'm liking that Mott strawberry definitely a lighter texture than what the Welch's is yeah that's pretty good in that that's a nice flavor completely different flavor than the Walsh's seem like the mots is not as sharp as a flavor where the Welch's had really a really brisk strawberry or kind of strawberry flavor and of course them and the mots is also kind of a strawberry flavor boy which one do I like the best I don't know they were both good but I liked the lighter texture of the monster that was interesting alright so let's try a different one here I'm gonna try what I think is the grape compare that to the grape of Amman so on the left is the Welch's grape and on the right is the mots grape and really the match looks better I just like the shininess of it like I say this is my first time well I guess actually now this is my second time eating fruit actually it's my third time eating fruit snacks because I already had two so this was count as my third and fourth time eating a fruit snacks which one should I go first we're gonna go off the Welch's on the Left what I think is grape could be mulberry don't know so let's try the Welch's and see how this is first first impression rubbery rubber eraser I hate to say that as soon as you get through the the really heavy texture get a really sharp a really sharp fruit flavor I mean it's almost to the point of being sour just a little bit of sourness and a lot of people especially kids like the sourness and look at this I'm making a little a fruit snack man see that well in that cute or a star we can make a star alright sounds like I'm back in elementary school again isn't that cute but yeah my first impression as soon as I take a bite out of one of these it's rubber that's weird doesn't taste like Robert just the texture of like a rubber eraser I don't really particularly care for the texture of these Welch's but the flavor is just very powerful not in a bad way very very powerful maybe too powerful for some but I know kids like a a sweet sour thing so that might be really good for kids all right so let's try the mots pseudo grape and see how this is hmm I like that texture much better certainly a milder flavor not as a sharp not as tangy or not really that sour flavor just a smooth light grape flavor that's a good flavor hmm wow this is really interesting but I have made my decision folks Wow what can I say this was really interesting and I gotta admit this has been one of the most fun videos I've done so far because these are both products that I have never ever tried and probably never would have tried unless I was doing these videos and this was a lot of fun and this was educational both of these obviously as you can tell by my Murray accents both of these were really really good well we do have a winner here and you might be surprised you may not be surprised if you've tried both of these which one of these do you like the best I'm really curious to know what you guys think about these but I like the sharp taste of the Welch's quite a bit it was nice it was a nice shock after you get over that unfortunately what I would call a rubbery texture I had the first bite of these waltzes fruit snacks so the the sharp almost sour sweet taste of the Welch's overpowered it makes you quickly forget about the the rubbery texture that you had to go through to get to that really sharp flavor so that was interesting the mots had a smoother texture and also a smoother flavor so the texture I think matched the flavor quite quite well these both these products are good and completely different the one is not trying to copy off the other so this again is with a lot of food products it's gonna come right down to personal preference do you like a firmer texture do you like a sharper a sour sweet flavor or do you like a smoother texture and a smoother flavor well in this instance for me the winner is the moths I really enjoyed the moths I liked the smoother texture and I liked the smoother flavor but I'm not a kid anymore and maybe if I was in elementary school I might be just raving over these but then again we got to remember the mots are a better value in that you get more for the money but you only get 22 pouches so it's a give-and-take with both these but when it comes to flavor and texture I choose the mots over the Welch's so thank you for watching food fights and keep watching because there's more videos just like this coming up real soon so I'll see you in the next video", "pE0VnUZMvKM": "everybody's favorite party tree vodka gummy bears okay so we start off with some gummy bears

kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "sWZbXjvrCuE": "hey there everyone welcome back to the channel a fairy tale flavor i'm celina and today i'm showing you all how to make homemade gummy bears in a food processor or high power blender add in half a cup of fresh strawberries or any berries of your choice our daughter loves strawberries so that's what i'm using then add in three tablespoons of water [Music] and one to two tablespoons of honey just depends on how sweet you want

the tablespoons of gelatin and it's fully dissolved you can remove from the stove [Music] now you're going to need silicone molds i'm using the gummy bear molds but you can use any shape of silicone molds of your choice just place the mixture over the mold and i like to use a scraper to help fill them in but if you don't have one you can also use a butter knife as well [Music] once you're done you're going to place them in the fridge to set for about 30 minutes oh baby girl you want to tell them oh my goodness what do we have to tell him huh oh my goodness all right everyone today for this

"ugdNM_4yUds": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a preservative for your homemade goods and for myself I particularly use it for my gummies as you will see in most of my recipes that I have posted here they all call for potassium sorbate that way I can keep my gummies outside of the fridge I'm in a drawer in my pocket in my car and my desk whatever I want and they're gonna last just like if you were to buy a bag of gummies or candy from a convenience store or a grocery store I know a lot of people make their own gummies and then they mold or they just don't last and the simple solution for that is this bag of potassium sorbate which I bought for like $15 and this will probably last me forever like I'll probably never even get through this so the way to make it is with potassium sorbate and water and that's it so I already have some made here but I'm going to demonstrate to you guys how to make it yourself you can make whatever amount you want if you want to do a smaller amount you can do that a larger amount that's fine the only thing that matters is that it's one part fast-absorbing to three parts water so I'm going to do three quarter cups of water and 1/4 cup of potassium sorbate if you wanted a smaller amount you would also do 1 tbsp potassium sorbate 3 tablespoons water so it doesn't really matter as long as it's 1/4 potassium sorbate 3 parts water I'm just going to fill this up to 3/4 of a cup this is just room temperature water do not pour it into a mason jar and then I'm going to put 1/4 cup of the potassium sorbate granules in today [Applause] let's pour that right now give it a little shake so I just shook this up and it's been like 30 seconds and you can already see it's completely dissolved once it sits for a little bit longer it'll become more clear like the mixture I already have made I'm just going to pour this into my mixture I got made previously yeah and that's literally it it's so easy the hardest part is probably gonna be actually frying the potassium sorbate when you use this you'll just need about an eighth of a teaspoon or two a quarter of a teaspoon depending on how big your recipe is for companies I usually use between 1/8 and 1/4 of a teaspoon and I don't believe he throws in the fridge I do just because it's convenient for me and my apartments small so there's not really that many places to keep it I have heard some people struggling to find the tascam sorbet I was gonna post a link and I will when the time comes that it's priced better but I paid like $15 for this over a year ago and now on Amazon it's like $60 which is completely insane but I will post the link when I find it for a decent price but this is a standard ring convened it's used for people who make beer so I really know where you go to get their supplies but if you went to a place where they have very few supplies you probably find this there and I doubt it would be overpriced but yeah that's it please let me know if you guys have any questions I hope you enjoyed the video if you did please give it a like leave your comment and subscribe as always I love from you guys I hope you guys have a wonderful day and make some delicious shelf-stable snacks", "8cWP1sf1taA": "what's going on you guys welcome back to a new video today we're going to be filming a very fun challenge today i'm going to be eating

everything that we picked up one thing that i did get was this gummy bear which is the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear if this video gets at 20 000 likes i will try it in my next asmr so give this video a thumbs up and now let's see what i end up having for my snack for our snack we're going to be having this a gummy pickle with real pickle taste so let's see what this tastes like i'm kind of nervous because i love pickles but just like the thought of like real pickle taste on a gummy i don't know about that okay let's check it out it smells like oh my god i was gonna say it smells like green apple but i can literally smell the pickle now oh i don't know this is gonna be good okay let's try it out oh my god it's so bad so disgusting this is no for me this is i cannot even swallow this it's like sweet and then you get like the actual flavor of the pickle this is a no-go for me so i will see you guys in a couple hours for lunch time hopefully for lunch time we have better luck than our snacks two hours later okay guys it's been a couple hours and now it is time for lunch my stomach is growling and it's also hurting a little bit i don't know if it's because i'm hungry or if it's because all this candy is starting to get to me but either way it's lunch time so i do want to eat so cameraman what do we have for lunch oh you have pizza a hot dog a cheeseburger and a coke okay so for 2021 i was like you know what i'm gonna eat healthy but i guess 2021 had other plans for me and i mean i'm not married so let's try it so we do have some pizza with no veggies okay just the pepperoni and cheese awesome this is what it looks like oh it smells really good okay honestly after this video i think i'm gonna have to go to the dentist there's like so much tugging and they're so like hard to chew i'm just like you know but it's really good i can definitely taste this is like a strawberry flavor it's really good this is definitely vanilla and this is orange right here so this is not bad it's actually pretty good i'm really excited for this hot dog though look at this look at the detail we have the bun veggies the sausage and then we have the mustard and the ketchup now it's a little bit hard to take out just because it's not like a whole piece you do have to take it like one by one trying to pick it up can you let me see let's try this there we go so let's try it out what flavor is this that is so freaking good that is the best one that i've tried so far today now we're gonna try the cheeseburger there's lettuce the bun the meat the cheese and everything it's just it's really well made so let's give it a try do you guys want to take a bite now let me take a bite oh dang i don't need to go to the gym this was definitely a workout it's pretty good but it's not one of my favorite ones next thing that we're going to try is the gummy coke i am really excited for this one just because like i love the mini gummy ones that are like the coke flavor so this one i know it's going to be good so let's give it a try that sounded really painful it wasn't painful though it just sounded like you know it wasn't that bad mmm does it taste like the mini ones mm-hmm i have to say our lunch was very successful i cannot wait for dessert because i know dessert's gonna be extra sweet so i will see you guys in about 40 minutes to an hour so we can have dessert and then we're gonna have dinner so yeah i'll see you guys in a bit for dessert i have ice cream and i also have a donut they both look pretty good but i think the donut's gonna be better which one do you think's gonna taste better the donut looks pretty fine right i really like how it has like the chocolate detail and like even the sprinkles so i have the ice cream we're gonna try it out to see what it tastes like vanilla look i was expecting i was like this would be vanilla for sure it is vanilla i'm also going to try the little cone strawberry this one is the one that i'm really excited for oh not me ruining the chocolate i really want to try the chocolate so i'm going to give it a try it tastes just like chocolate really well that's good so the donut one has two layers i'm gonna try the strawberry one first this one it tastes just like the chocolate drizzle on top of the donut overall i really think that the donut one was my favorite one just because like i had a lot of different flavors going on versus like the ice cream cone so i have to say this one is my favorite one so i'm going to sit here and enjoy my dessert and then we'll see what we have for dinner it is time for our last meal of the day yay i'm lucky so happy because i'm like i'm ready for some real food i'm tired of candy honestly after this video i don't think i'm gonna have candy for a very very long time so for a dinner we're having a whole buffet we do have a sushi here we also have some noodles as well as a taco now fun fact i don't know if any of you guys know this but i have never ever ever in my life tried sushi like raw sushi my mom never let me eat sushi so this is the closest i'm ever gonna get to sushi so let's see let's try i'm guessing this is kind of like the soy sauce the details i know it's so cute i really like how they put like the detail in like the rose look at this i don't know what this is supposed to be because i'm not really into sushi let's try this one it's like a double roll me trying to use chopsticks and i don't even know how to use them these are some of my favorite candies but usually i get like the peach ones i have never tried the green ones what flavor is this oh this is apple i have never tried apple ones i usually always get like the peach ones but this is really good i also want to try this one because i think this one has like a marshmallow oh the marshmallow you have to try this that is good it's like so soft and chewy that one is pretty good that one is really good i also want to try the noodles you should try one of these let's try is it lemon i don't know what is it i don't think this has a flavor it sounds crunchy oh it tastes like perfume why does it taste like perfume i don't know oh yeah no i'm not a big fan of that one no let's try some noodles this is what i'm talking about also look at the detail of this it even comes with a little egg so let's try the noodles let's try to slap the noodles impossible i really want to try the little egg oh these what are these thinking it's like marshmallow it's really it has it's like coated in sugar it looks like a marshmallow reminds me of peeps it reminds me of the peeps that's banana flavor that's really good look at this taco i'm really sad this is cardboard i really wish that like they can make the shell like gummy i feel like that would have been awesome but look at everything that's inside you should try to bite everything at the same time these are really really tough to chew guys but i have to say my favorite ones that i tried from everything were these especially because of the marshmallow it was so good also the little green rings i have never tried apple flavor so that was my first time trying it as well of this so i guess kind of like the marshmallows were like my favorite ones just because they weren't like so tough on my teeth and i wasn't like yanking on them but overall i have to say today's video was pretty successful after this video i am not going to have any more gummy bears or anything that is gummy related i'm not going to be eating it for a while i am so glad that this challenge has come to an end because right now all i can think about is just in and out a real burger with some real fries and a real drink yes that is exactly what i deserve because i feel like i put meat in my stomach through a lot after this video so don't mind me guys i'm going to go get some real food because i am literally done with this gummy food all right guys that is the end of today's video thank god because i am so done eating all this gummy food for 24 hours i really hope you enjoyed today's video if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up remember if today's video gets to 20 000 likes i'll be trying this little nitro gummy

it's like 90 degrees out which is the hottest that it has been\nin a long time it is getting me all excited for summertime and all the get\ntogether 's and the parties and so in today's video I'm gonna show you how to\nmake some rummy gummy bears but as a special bonus to go hand in hand with\nrummy gummy bears I'm going to show you how to make some vodka infused gummies\nand they are delicious and they all go together they're perfect for any party\nso let's go spice things up okay so the first thing we're gonna do is get these\nlittle party cups and just put them on a pan or a tray just so it's easier to\nhall off somewhere next we're gonna get our gummies and we have three different\nkinds so of course these are the tropical gummy bears and these are lifesaver\ngummies and the flavor is basically just tangy so after we get these party cups on\nthe pan we are just going to open their little bag up and just start taking the little gummies putting them right in the party cups but\nyou don't want to fill them all the way to the brim and because your gummies\nwill expand and that fills up six I have a few more left but I promised my kids I\nwould save these for them next we are going to put the lifesaver wild berry\ncandy in the party cups and I have to tell you these all smells so good oh my\nword now you can't separate them with colors if you prefer but you really\ndon't need to and this filled up seven because\nremember you don't want to fill it up to the brim and I did have to save a few\nfor my kids so really this would probably fill up eight and this would\nprobably fill up seven for the gummies and these are the small packages but it\ndoesn't really matter and then of course we are doing the sweet tart flavor and\nnow the sweet tart flavor if you can see they kind of have a little bit of sugar\ncoating on them all they smell so good as well and then just put them in your\ncup okay so now we are gonna add our liquor to our gummies and we're gonna\nstart out with our gummy bears and our gummy bears our tropical flavors so we\nare going to do tropical flavor rum okay so you want to make sure the rum is\ncovering the gummy bears completely okay so now we're doing the wild berry\nlifesavers so I chose a blueberry vodka but you can also do the strawberry vodka or the raspberry vodka basically any berry but I chose\nblueberry and so you'll just want to pour the liquor right over the top of\nthe gummies okay so the sweet tart gummies are\nlittle tangy so I chose an orange vodka but really you can choose whatever kind\nyou want okay so now you want to put your gummies in the fridge for at least\n24 hours if you have them in longer it's good because then their bellies get\nfilled with liquor more if you don't want to know what these are these are\nmudslide pudding shots I will link the video below if you want to know how to\nmake your own all right alright guys so it has been about a day\nand a half and if you can see the gummies if you\ncan see most of the liquid is not covering them anymore\ntherefore it has gone into the gummies that is a good indicator that it is done\nand you are ready to party oh man guys can you see these I'm super\nexcited I'm gonna try all three kinds for you so first we are going to try the\nrummy gummy bears and you can just use a toothpick or you can use your fingers it\ndoesn't really matter mmm good okay so the next one we're gonna try is the\nlifesaver wild berry time so good okay now we're going to try the sweet tart\nmMmmm that one's really good but a little tang you I like that one I\nlike a mom they're so good and if you can see\nthere's just a little bit of liquor at the bottom so of course when you are\ndone eating these you can chug the liquor down and they are so good and\nyour friends will love it you will be a hit at any party I hope you guys give\nthese a try and if you have any questions just comment below and if you\nwould like to see more videos please remember to subscribe to this channel\nthank you guys so much bye and see you in the next video", "2KSKzHy_ilY": "hi everyone in this video I'm gonna show you guys how to make some kool-aid gummy worms so to make keulegan worms you need three main things obviously you need like gummy worms you need kool-aid and you need bags to put them in so I'm gonna take you this one final and I'm gonna show you the things you guys need to make these jungle worms so these are the gummy worms that I'm talking about these black foreskin ones in here go to four gummy worms I'm gonna buy this because I'm gonna show you guys how to make it so back in high school I literally used to buy the full rack of this barn final and then there was another spawn final like 20 minutes away I'd buy the full rack and the goomar rooms again tomorrow final used to know me as the governing room guy and I'd come back with like seven or eight bags dummy so that's all they had and then open a new Lane for me because I paint mostly in quarters and in dollars and it took me a long time because if people pay me in quarters I've spend in quarters I have to buy one box of this for about four to five bags the gummy ones this big pack of kool-aid is the one that you need to buy it's eight dollars and you get thirty four quarts this right here is the only thing I should be buying not these little tiny pants right here don't buy this you're not gonna make profit at all so I got all the stuff that I need to make my kool-aid gummy worms and I'll meet you guys when I back home so before you even get started you can have to clean your area and wash your hands it's important to have a clean area and clean working environment because you argue and be making these candies for people and you don't want anybody to get sick so you probably can't see my face right now but I just washed my hands so what I like to do first before doing anything is putting a clean white towel over your working area to make sure your environment is clean so I place a white paper towel down here to make sure that the gummy worms don't touch the towel and they only stay on the paper towel after in my areas clean I put on a glove on only one hand because I don't want to waste too many gloves and I just use this hand to touch the gums this hand will not touch the game worms and this hand will touch the gummy worms so the first step to making these gummy worms is to get a plastic bag open it up like this actually gonna get your bag of gummy worms like this open it up so I put seven gummy worms in a bag so one two three four five six seven so I'm gonna put it in the bag like this and the next step is to get the kool-aid right here right now I'm gonna show you how much to put but later in the video I'll show you guys a nice little trick to make it go faster so I put about this much I don't know if you guys can see so the way I measure my amounts of kulit is I put it in a teaspoon and I just sprinkle it on the gummy worms and that's it and when you're done you just close it up make sure you take most of the air out you're gonna leave a little bit so you can shake it up and get the kool-aid everywhere and when you're done it should look something like this overnight it should look wetter because I think the gummy worms have a little bit of oil in them which makes it red so don't get freaked out when the bag looks a little bit wetter so the bag is done I'm gonna show you guys how to make a lot more bags in shorter amount of time so normally when I'm making these no worms I get a mug with a little teaspoon inside and I just pour the kool-aid inside so I don't have to keep reaching in here so when I'm done putting everything inside the mug I just open about thirty bags because one big bag of these makes me about 32 bags normally I'll make about 150 to 200 bags normally with the help of my dad something is my sister and brother help too so I'm gonna make about 30 of these bags when I'm done I'll get back to you guys for the next step so the next step in the process is to put 7w herbs in each of these bags so after I'm done putting my gummy worms in the bag like this I'll leave it face up and get ready for the next step so when I'm done putting all the gummy worms in each bag I'll just get the  like this and just get about a teaspoon and just put it in like this to each bag so the final step is to close each of bag one by one and when you're done you should get about 32 bags so as you can see I made all the bags after doing some quick math on this I calculated that each bag is about 35 cents so as long as you sell it for more than 35 cents that's profit also what I did is I'd give 20 to 50 of these bags to my friends and I'd have them sell it and give them some commission as long as both parties agree on what the Commission should be it should be all good so I'd make the gummy worms usually every Sunday and Wednesday because Sunday is the beginning of the week and Wednesday is the middle of the week Sunday I'd make about 150 to 200 W worms and then on Wednesday it depends how many I have left and I'll just try to make about 50 to 100 to get through the rest of the week just be careful when you're selling these because some schools don't allow it so make sure you check with your school first other than that thank you guys for watching please like comment and subscribe and stay tuned for my next video yo what's up my name is Paul I just I just purchased some of Nico's famous gummy worms and I thought they were really good you know the seven really build me up for a dollar two really good price I'm vice time you could always contact Nick oh it's really sweet savory and it tastes good [Music]", "gxWGE768MxY": "Welcome to The Gummy Bear Show!

welcome back to my channel today I'm hanging out with my sister well everybody I am so excited because today's video is super special it is a first for us we are celebrating and making a recipe for Mother's Day and it's special because this is gonna be the first Mother's Day that's not just for our mom anymore yeah this is Molly's first Mother's Day as a mom herself I got something so here I know why do you think of your sister and know your mama oh mama look at my mama over here you're an auntie this is this is so crazy I know I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like

pants yeah because you're here because you feel okay you're gonna go hang out with Uncle Mike now and we're gonna finish making some gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she loved it yes she would let me oh right cue the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tada here are the homemade wine gummy bears that we made today we have our rose a blue are red and our white yep and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a white grape juice you can do whatever you'd like you just evenly replace the ingredient again I'll be putting the recipe down below and we'll be taking lots of pictures and posting these all over social medias if you make these gummy bears please take a picture and send it to us oh my god we loves you your baking creations it like makes us so happy it makes our day this recipe is so yummy and a perfect recipe for Mother's Day so I hope you guys enjoy the idea also

bye bye [Music]", "EY7Z97Ys2m8": "hey everyone welcome back to health and nutrition today's video is going to get you into the Halloween spirit we are making three healthy and delicious Halloween treats I did a poll over on Twitter a couple weeks ago asking what chocolate bar you would like me to recreate or health apply in this case and Twix one so I knew I had to recreate homemade Twix and then I also recreated Rolo's and mini gummy bears just because I know everyone has to some people are chocolate lovers some people aren't so I got you cover for both and let's just hover it in into the recipes recipe we're going to make is Rolo chocolate here are your ingredients chocolate chips medjool dates peanut butter honey coconut oil sea salt and some vanilla you will also need a candy mold I got mine on Amazon so I will put a link down below in a food processor you want to process your dates until they kind of form a ball and this will be a nice gooey caramel mixture that's gonna be perfect for the center of our Rolo and I just like to break it up halfway through and process it again just to really make sure everything is nice and creamy in a small saucepan you're going to melt together some peanut butter in the honey and some vanilla I also added a dash of sea salt but it's optional bring that to a low simmer you're really just warming it up and you're gonna get this caramely smooth mixture and going to add that in with the dates this combination together really makes an awesome healthy caramel sauce I scrape mine half way through and then this is what it should look like transfer your caramel mixture into a bowl cover it with some plastic wrap and then refrigerate it while we make our chocolate you want it just to harden slightly so we can actually roll it into balls in a small saucepan with a little bit of water you just want to place another bowl on top add in your chocolate chips in coconut oil and bring that over to the stove until everything is melted just on low heat making sure to stir it constantly so it doesn't burn now it's time to use that candy mold I just added my chocolate into this little squeezable tube I really love using it for projects like this and then I'm filling up the mold about 1/3 of the way through making sure to get the edges so they harden in the refrigerator so we're going to pop this in the fridge and then we're gonna get our filling ready so by now your dayt caramel mixture would have hardened a little bit in the fridge just roll it into small little balls making sure they're all roughly the same size and that they fit in your candy mold I also have a little bit of water on the side just because it gets a little sticky and the water helps it not stick to your hands as much now that our chocolate has hardened you can just pop your little caramel balls right in the middle I flattened mine a little bit and then I just do this to all them and then you can just top it off with some more melted chocolate during this process I definitely felt like a chocolatier I also give it a quick tap just to even everything out and then I pop it in the fridge for another 30 minutes or so once it's ready you can just kind of pop them out they took a little bit of effort to get them out but if you just let them sit for a couple minutes on the counter they will remove a little bit easier and there you have it little Rolo chocolates with a gooey caramel Center they're so good and I also got these little foil wraps at the store but I will find them on Amazon for you guys they really make it look like little chocolates I love it and there you have it Rolo chocolate next up we're making Twix chocolate bars for the shortbread crust layer you will need coconut flour eggs coconut oil coconut sugar sea salt and some vanilla and a medium-sized bowl you're going to mix together your dry ingredients followed by your wet mix everything together until it forms a dough and then you want to press your dough into a parchment lined cookie tray I just kind of crumble mine across so it kind of makes a more leveled even layer and then I press it down with the back of the spatula I poke a few holes before I bake it this helps it so it doesn't rise and puff up in the oven because we don't want that you're going to bake it at 350 Fahrenheit for about 15 or 18 minutes depending on your oven let it fully cool and then you're going to add in the same date caramel mixture that we made for the rolos except you don't want to put it in the fridge you want to keep it nice and creamy if you find it a little bit hard just stick it in the microwave for like a couple seconds and it'll get nice and creamy and spreadable throw that into the fridge to harden once everything has chilled you can pop it out of the pan and then take a sharp knife and cut it up into little Twix sized pieces I got 20 out of my batch then taking that same melted chocolate recipe we made for the chocolate Rolo's you can just dip your naked Twix bars in it so they are fully coated and then I just pull mine out with a fork and place it on some parchment paper to cool and this is what they should look like and the inside is so delicious and gooey and these were my favorite you need to try them and then last but not least we're making mini gummy bears these were so fun to make and here's what you'll need some strawberries I just used frozen strawberries that I thought some unflavored gelatin honey lemon juice and then these cute mini gummy bear molds I will have a link for them below they are super cheap in a high-speed blender you want to add in all your ingredients except for the gelatin and blend it on high until smooth in a small saucepan you want to pour in your strawberry sauce sprinkle on your gelatin and let it sit for about five minutes just so it can kind of thicken after five minutes you can bring it over to the stove on low to medium heat until you reach a simmer and then cook for five minutes making sure to stir constantly with a whisk so it doesn't burn once it's cooked give it a last stir and then you can just start filling your little gummy bear mold the kit I bought actually came with this little dropper which made it super easy to be super precise once that's done place it in the fridge to let them Harden I'm going to do the same thing with this mango gummy bear option I'm just using frozen mangos instead of strawberries fill up your gummy bear molds and refrigerate and there you have it little mini gummy bears fill your little treat bags up with all the candy that you just made and give these to someone you know I don't know if I would give like homemade chocolate out to like strangers doing like trick-or-treating but for friends and family this is totally acceptable or for yourself for Halloween as always I will have the written instructions for all three recipes over my blog health net nutrition dossier so that's going to be it for my Halloween treats recipe video I hope you guys enjoyed all three of them and let me know which one was your favorite and which one you're most excited to recreate I'll do a poll on YouTube here I haven't done one before I'll test it out and see how I like it maybe I'll do one for like recommend recommending like future videos so let me know are you a gummi bear Twix or Rolo lover I'm definitely a Twix lover I actually have one right here that I'm going to fight up on camera so good oh my god but the real thing just see that those layers and it has like a hint of peanut butter from the caramel it's chewy the little shortbread cookie oh my god I'm taco over my ham mmm I feel like if you're going to just make one make the Twix so good but if you're a gummy bear lover I understand mm-hmm damn that's delicious guys make this you will not regret it and then we won't feel jealous when your kids come home with all their Halloween candy thank you so much for watching give this video a big thumbs up if you like a chocolate and don't forget to subscribe if you aren't already I'm really hoping to hit 200,000 subscribers by the end of 2016 so help me out and hit that red subscribe button I would really

is my free 21 and today I'll be showing how to make collectibles to make this you need your gummy bears or whatever zombies Tushingham using Krabby Patties stuff make a container or plastic bags kool-aid or yeah any flavors I prefer using tropical plants or cherry but tropical punch of the best first open your container and then what you have to do next but this is wash them to make it wet so the kool-aid will stick better sit around if you don't want to mix it too much something one fell down okay that's good yeah then so once you have this you can get your kool-aid tropical punch no and then you open it just party pour it in [Music] if you have a lot of gummy bears you pour the whole thing in well right now I only have a little bit so I just pour some which is like half way get the cover boy then you look a bit disgusting but issue tastes good oh boy dad no dude try one what's really sour yeah bye YouTube see you next time", "CScCRbSGaLc": "presenting the one and only fruit-bearing gummy bears made with the goodness of real food juice they're called amazin fruit a blazing fruit is so pretty you can hardly bear it tropical flavors too", "pgPdJJwt9SA": "ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to tequila gummy bears that's what I'm talking about look at the color on these bad boys those are gorgeous so we start off with some tequila okay little bit of sugar stir stir stir over low heat okay wait a minute you're burning off the alcohol that's why we keep the heat low in one or two hot okay we want this alcohol to stay alcoholic stir stir stir a little gelatin okay beautiful we got a little mix now we come around with a bit of food coloring to get off but look at the desired color look at that maybe a little bit more because we want a nice neon green and then we just squirt it you could pour it in but it'll spill everywhere so it's good if you could use one of these don't stop a thing is just squeeze it in and it's beautiful so this is a gummi bear mold okay and now we put it in the freezer and fridge sorry break it up and look what we have we have little tequila gummy bears Oh gorgeous I love these okay", "s6GiYwYvka0": "fireball just kidding\nI'm really excited to share this recipe with you right before the holidays in\ntoday's video we are making fireball gummies I don't know if you've ever\nheard of fire bears fire bears are basically gummy bears that are made with\nfireball cinnamon whisky and they are delicious but I'm going to show you how\nto make it with the bears along with other gummy shapes because you might\nprefer a different gummy shape if you go to buy them if you go to research\nthey're kind of expensive to buy and they sell out really fast but they're\nsuper easy to make so I figured I would share with you how to make fireball gummies so let's go spice things up okay so the first thing you want to do\nis get a bowl of course I use a glass bowl because it keeps the heat you will\nwant a half a cup of sugar you can really use any kind of sugar you want\njust some kind of sweetener in the past I have used corn syrup too and if you\ndon't like a lot of sugar you can use 1/4 cup of sugar but I like it sweet\nlike the gummies so 1/2 a cup of sugar next you'll want 3 packets of unflavored\ngelatin 3 packets is equivalent to 3 tablespoons so if you don't have packets\nand you just need to measure it out it's 3 tablespoons and just put that in there\nas well next you'll want one cup of fireball\nwhiskey and if you do not like the cinnamon flavor you can always use a\ndifferent kind of alcohol but since we are making cinnamon fireball gummies\nthen we will want one cup of fireball whiskey and just pour it in and since\nthe color is kind of like an orange it's not quite a red I want it to be red like\nreal cinnamon gummy bears so I'm just gonna use some gel food coloring and I'm\ngonna use a red I would put about a teaspoon of the gel\nfood coloring so it is a nice red color this is so strong smelling it smells so\ngood you can definitely smell the cinnamon okay so you can either heat it\nin a pan or you can put it in the microwave I like to put it in the\nmicrowave because I don't want to burn off the alcohol so as long as you keep\nthe liquid under 90 degrees you will not burn out the alcohol so I like to put it\nin for 30 seconds take it out stir it put it in for 30 more seconds stir it\nand then one last 30 seconds so a minute and a half basically okay so now all the\nsugar and the gelatin is dissolved into the liquid its melted nicely and now we\ncan get started okay so now what you will need to turn it into little gummies\nyou'll need some molds and these are silicone molds so these are actually\ngummy bears they're adorable anyways and then these ones are Christmasy\nones and it will make this much so this doesn't look like very much but it will\nactually make a lot of gummies and then it comes with one of these to put it in\nthere but anyways but if you do not have any silicone molds you can just use some\nice cube trays that are kind of cute looking or even a pan just make sure you\nspray them really good with cooking spray now even though these are silicone\nmolds and the gummies come out pretty easy I still like to spray mine with\ncooking spray because if not the gummies all kind of stick to each other\nand it's just a little bit harder to get out with them sticking to everything so\nI'm just gonna spray this with cooking spray you don't want to do too much\nbecause you don't want your gummies to taste like butter this will save you a ton of time because\nit would be easier to get out of the molds anyways and I'm just putting mine\nin a pan so that it's not all like wobbly or anything that it just stays\nnice and straight and I can just put them in the fridge easily anyway so now\nthat they are sprayed with cooking spray and your sugar is all melted and\ndissolved now we can start putting them in the silicone mold okay so this is\nwhen you want to kind of work fast so that this liquid does not already\nstart to form and turn into gummies before you get them in the molds so I'm\njust gonna fill all these all the way so I'm just gonna continue to do this\nand we will come back to it once I am done\nokay so into the beer fridge they go you'll want to put them in for at least\n30 minutes I like to put mine in for an hour before I check them just so that I\nknow they're completely done okay so now for the fun part they have\nbeen in the fridge for one hour and of course you do not have to leave them in\nthe fridge after they turn into gummies they can sit out on the counter if you\nwant but if you can see their little gummies now and they come out easily out\nof this see how fun is that and then I'll show you the little gummy bears\nthese are fun too so these are harder to get out a little bit just because they\nhave intricate parts but they're still pretty easy and that's all there is to\nit and here in the end result alright guys pretty exciting I got the\nlittle bear I got the Christmas tree what one do you want me to try both okay I can really taste that cinnamon so\nthey're very similar to jell-o shots of course but they are gummies so let's\nbite off the top of the tree did you ever play like that as a kid oh I bit off the leg. Anyways these are\nso good guys I hope you guys go home and make these or make them for a party or\ngive as a gift they are perfect and if you have any questions just comment\nbelow and if you like this video and you want to see more remember to subscribe\nto this channel I had to eat it it was just calling to me alright bye and see\nyou in the next video  ", "3vebCu3Qiu4": "[Music] welcome to another episode of science is everywhere the home edition my name is Maria and I'm from Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting to see so thank you for tuning in we very much appreciate our time and hopefully you did as well and we will see you next time as science is everywhere bye guys thank you for watching our virtual purple museum's broadcast if you're enjoying this content please consider making a donation

welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "D_pXsuYt2qw": "when a challenge goes wrong whoops [Music] are you ready

the Bell so that you don't miss new gummy challenges from true thromes", "oOQlSEMnQs4": "hey Ron today I'm gonna show you guys recipe that I use from vegan gummy bears or any governor lolly as I guess these are great because they are really simple to thank and they avoid gelatin which is obviously ground-up animal hooves they avoid artificial colorings such are quite high quantities and a lot of volleys and they avoid excessive sugars and preservatives as well so they're really awesome thing to be able to do and you can personalize them I would recommend having a mould that has more than one more than one slot I only had an individual coming to be involved which was quite tedious but you can also just pull the mixture into a tray and louts it and then chop them up into little kind of cube lollies as well so I'm using a few different flavorings here which I'll show you guys the basic principle that I'm using is one cup of liquid to four tablespoons of agar agar powder so firstly I'm making a vanilla almond milk flavor and for that I'm using half a cup of almond milk two tablespoons of a baby powder one inch of vanilla pods beans and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia-sweetened and I'm just putting into a pot my half a cup of almond milk and then I'm adding into there my two tablespoons of a bag and just mixing it through thoroughly and I'm squeezing out my inch of Anila pods beans and putting them on the neck I'm adding in two tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten now mixing that up and putting it over low heat and allowing it to come to a seminar it will simmer for a couple of minutes and then it will start to thicken up nicely so once it's thickened up I'm taking my mold and I'm pouring a small amount in there and you can just put it in the freezer for 30 seconds or less and all sit really quickly and then you can pop out your first gummy beer or first tray of gummy bears hopefully and you can store them in the fridge next I'm going on to make the strawberry flavor that I'm using a quarter of a cup of strawberries a quarter of a cup of water two tablespoons of agar agar and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia like before sauce the same process I'm measuring up the berries with the water and you can strain them through some cloth and I'm just using a cheesecloth or a nut milk cloth to strain the berries through and then I'm adding my two tablespoons of agar agar powder and mixing them through and adding a small amount of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia just sweeten that and then I'm putting it on to low heat allowing it to bubble to and pouring it into my mold setting it and popping them out so next one that I'm doing for this as blueberries and I'm just using a quarter of a cup of blueberries and a quarter of a cup of water 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and some maple swimming pool stevia again and it's just the same process you could strain the berries or just puree them I'm actually leaving some of the pulp and this time it's quite nice like that and then pouring them into my molds once they've simmered with that guide a powder in here in allowing them to suit you so then I'm making a pineapple flavored one and this is using pineapple juice and it's quite an easy thing to do you could use it with any flavor adjustment also making some orange juice flavored ones as well I'm using half a cup of pineapple juice and add 2 tablespoons of agar agar you can also sweeten it a little bit further as well with some stevia if you wanted to and so I'm just mixing that together and then I am simmering it and pouring it into my molds and once I pop them out I had my little pineapple gummy bears and I also have these orange ones so then you've got some finished gummy bears those are flavors that I really like and they're so simple to do and you can continue playing around with all sorts of different flavors I haven't tried it yet but I'm thinking about doing you know like a coffee and almond milk once we milk and also trying different teas as well I thought my golden mango green tea would be really nice with the stevia in it and it would be really healthy as well so various things like that but just basically store them in the airtight container in the fridge for about a week they do sit perfectly fine at room temperature consistency wise but you know they don't have preservatives so you want to make sure that they're fine if you're going to do try this out I would love to your heart grows for you especially if you've got some awesome combinations and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope people wonderful day guys", "JccjODeZjPU": "ladies and gentlemen Rose a gummy bears this gummy bears made from Rosie it's the coolest thing ever so we get

actually able to eat a gummy bear in about a year way I've haven't eaten a gummy bear in probably two years I haven't eaten a gummy bear in a very very long time but I've been vegan for about 18 months or so and now I'm gonna have a chance at eating some gummy bears so young earth is a fantastic company what's nice about this is that it's not free it's literally everything free I think it's even gluten free and all that kind of stuff but it's only $3.00 on Amazon now it fluctuates in price so much so if it's like six dollars I'd wait a second wait til it's a lot lower and then buy thing cuz it's ridiculous hang a lot some of these prices are absolutely ridiculous they shouldn't be as much as they are but you know they get you to pay that much because it's Amazon and it's very very convenient but this is what the little thing is little thing looks like there are one fruit snack pouch is 70 calories 1 gram of protein if you care about protein it doesn't matter you got pomegranate pucker Mango Tango strawberry smash and perfectly peach so I'm gonna try this and then tell you what I think after it because this sounds like you know you're straight up swishing around some some some you know I don't know some some watermelon in your mouth or something it just sounds weird gross so I'll be back in just a second ok so this is what it looks like I feel like I should show what it looks like before I eat it here I'll do that I feel like that's a little kid thing to do I see that on I'll put on my mouth ho there we go okay now I'm gonna try it yeah okay so that's all for it very very good I definitely recommend it you they will be harder than you may be used to but Hasbro does what that was called there they're gummy bears are just about as hard as these so you're not really gonna miss out on having something that is softer or whatever you know it doesn't really matter it's a gummy bears and gummi bears taste fantastic it's young earth and that's what they do make fantastic products definitely recommend get this on Amazon I got it for three dollars and three cents and you can check this out in the description below I'll put a link to where I got it at so it'll just be easier for you and you can click on it and you know copy and paste it the address or whatever to the actual place and then you can get the exact one that got all that guys whatever you want to do you can do what you want to do but yeah that's all for this video hope you enjoyed my name is King syllabic and I will see you later", "uIPRrcxet6g": "g'day guys and welcome today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "0QqhsGGrtLk": "I should be here welcome back to my channel today let's make some CMOS gummies yummy ok so one of my twins she doesn't really care for the flavoring of these CMOS nor the slime enos so I said how can I make this more tasty bingo gummies so today is Sunday we spend mommy and daughter day cooking and watching movies so I am doing my cooking part and I've already washed and soaked my CMOS I cut it up and I put it in their blender with a touch of water and I found these dried cherries in their sauce so I said mom perfect let's try that so here I am mixing now I want the consistency of hmm like a pancake because I did try this once before and I didn't post it because it was a total flop I don't know if I put too much liquid or not enough of the agar agar powder but here we go so we put a little bit more water in here just to get the blades going and as you can see it's thick maybe a little too thick I wasn't quite sure here so I let it blend so we can get most of that chopped up I had a couple of chunks but I'm gonna try it here at home with my ninja blender to see if I can get it a little smoother so you can see I'm pouring it in the pot it is thick and I said I don't know if that's gonna be too thick so here's my agar agar powder I put two teaspoons in the pot is not heated it's still cold so I'm mixing it in with the whisk and once I got it completely blended I had it some more water because we wanted a little looser than this because I got to remember that the CMOS will gel but the agar agar will gel it even more so I didn't want to take the risk of it being hard so I loosened it up some more and I do apologize I don't have measurements because this was my firt well my second try and I was just really playing around with this and praying that it came out right okay I don't know if you can tell that it's loose but not watery so into my gummy bear molds I left the squirt tube home so thank goodness they had a measuring cup I could use and so I had to use as you see an ice tray and into the fridge they went and within an hour this was the results and I'm so pleased with this I can't wait to do it again so if you try this and you come up with some more ideas please let me know please don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video peace", "8deEGBKOykQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be making some keto sugar-free gummies I totally love these gummies I love that there's no food coloring and they're so simple to make they're easy they're kid-approved you can take them on the go and they're really low-calorie so if you want to see how to make these and how to customize them yourself then go ahead and keep watching the video you don't need that many things you're gonna need some hot water some teabags some gelatin liquid sweetener and some mix-ins if you'd like to switch up the flavors today I'm going for Tazo passion tea I love this blend it's so delicious it's very fruity so I love that I can make some fruit gummies and I also love that I can make sour gummies which I'll show you how I do that in just a second I like to use something with a spout so this little measuring cup works perfect for this if you don't have a water kettle then you're gonna want a microwave or boil your water ahead of time and then let it steep in this little pitcher so that there's a spout on it so after it cools down I put it in the refrigerator to chill completely look how dark that is it's just so good it extracted all of that delicious flavor from the teabags and you don't have to squeeze out your teabags like I do but I like to get all the liquid out some T's it can make the liquid cloudy and if you want to avoid that to make nice clear gummies just don't squeeze it I don't have a problem with this specific tea so at this point you with your cold liquid you're gonna add your gelatin you can get this kind of gelatin which you would just have to measure out with a table spoon or a scale like I'm doing here and I'm gonna measure out 28 grams but you can also use the packets and it's four tablespoons or four packets so I'm gonna measure out 28 grams which is also equal to one ounce on my scale and then I'm gonna stir that in completely you want to mix it in really really really well and if your liquid is cold it'll mix in really well so when you do chill it make sure you chill your tea down all the way and then you're gonna microwave it for 30 seconds three times depending on your microwave until it's completely liquid and hot and then I just like to give it one more stir just to make sure that it's totally incorporated I like liquid sucralose you guys can use whatever sweetener you want you can use granular sweetener and just make sure that it's hot enough to mix in and totally dissolve the sweetener so I like to use a roughly half of a teaspoon of sweetener you can use liquid stevia if you'd like and then at this point you'll add in all of your mix ins you can do apple cider vinegar for Tang but I want mine really sour so I went ahead and I'm going to use some citric acid I have a bunch of this stuff it's food grade and it's totally fine to add if you don't want to use some sort of man-made substance then you can use lemon or whatever else you'd like so just mix it in really really well you want that completely dissolved because that stuff is super sour and if you'd like you can add your extracts I have lemon and raspberry but I'm not gonna add anything else to mine but that's just an option I want to let you guys know about so give a one final little stir always taste your mixture because that's what your gummies are gonna taste like I wanted mine just a little bit more sweet so I added a little bit more liquid sucralose you know do what you guys want to do if you want I'm super sweet Yolo just do whatever you want to do and then I am going to scrape off all the bubbles because once this sets the bubbles are going to basically dry on top and to avoid it looking not so appealing you just go ahead and scrape those off it's not a big deal I really love this mold I got it at a thrift store but I'm pretty sure that you could find something similar on eBay or Amazon and it works really well for these little individual gummies if you're extra just scrape off the top again just to make sure that they're nice and clear and chill them all the way so those are easy to remove from the mold and this is what you're left with eat some and then package the rest up I keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're nice and chewy every single time I want one and I hope you guys try this out if you do leave me a comment down below let me know what you think thank you

burst centers these are mixed fruit flavored gummy candies they were 250 at kroger and the sign on the display says that these are thick so it doesn't say that on the bag but it was on the display so they're in a resellable bag there are four flavors so that's that's everything in the bag so if you want to pick out four flavors um pick out red pink green punch uh what am i missing i don't know dark red light red i don't see a where is another light one is that a white one that looks exactly the same as that one maybe i'd need a dark red that's what i needed a dark red okay they say fat-free gluten-free colors from real sources eight pieces is 100 calories four fruity flavors we have cherry apple strawberry and pineapple these soft and delicious gummies are so juicy and so good that's because they have a delicious juicy burst center that's made with real fruit juice and colors from real sources they're also fat free and come in a variety of great fruity flavors so try our juicy gummies and delight in the magic of black forest these are manufactured by ferreira uh candy company in chicago yes they do so do you want to do uh uh cherry let's do strawberry i think it's gonna be the light one um a little liquid in there definitely strawberry it's more of a natural strawberry i love the texture of these they're very soft and a little chewy and if you wanted to you could make these last a while of course we're biting right into them because we want to try them for you but yeah these would be make great movie theater candy they will let's do the cherry except they're sticky good cherry flavor these do taste natural compared to like is it betty crocker that sells a lot of these like they'll sell trolls and yeah trolls and cars and all those i think that's betty crocker brand these do taste more natural you don't have fruit snacks or fruits fruit snacks yeah yeah i don't eat fruit snacks i don't know um these taste very very natural the ones you get in the little pockets yeah now i'm gonna go gummies and gummies these definitely taste more natural than a gummy yeah well oh yeah so i should be okay i see what you're saying so i should be comparing these to like albany okay and i'm thinking okay and i'm okay i'm literally thinking of fruit snacks okay well um because they do remind you of a fruit snack because they are so natural yes because they taste they taste more comparable to a fruit snack than they do to an all even the textures are very similar yeah yeah that's the truth then we have pineapple you really taste pineapple it's strong it's good flavor and again the textures are really good and they do give you enough of the liquid center to know that it's there yeah yeah it's not like full of liquid but there isn't there's a little touch of it this one's apple well i'm thinking like gushers that has the for the uh liquid in the middle the apple was okay that's probably my least favorite one awesome to me the flavor come at the very end yeah you got a little bit of apple yeah the apple you had to chew it for a minute and then you got it at the very end and like i said of course you could make these last for a while um i really really like these they're different than a gummy bear because the gummy bears is very chewy and almost rubbery these aren't like that these are more comparable to like a fruit snack they're they've got a little chew to them but they're hopefully they're softer so ultimately it's just a matter if you want a more candy flavor then you would want to buy like the albany yes but if you want a more natural flavor then you could buy this but they're good yeah i really do like these though i think kids will love them uh so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "qVwUhPEchho": "[Music] it's Thomas from frolic and I figured it's time for me to sit down with you and discuss a crisis that's going on we're in a lemon-peel crisis okay stores crack seed stores Long's Walmart anywhere you can find kind of crack seed they've been selling out of lemon peel and this is like the first time it's happened in forever but I feel like in the last six months eight months or so people have been going crazy for lemon peel gummies and so you know the origin of it is is a little muddy I heard it it comes from Hilo I also heard that it was probably started here on Oahu but whatever it is people are hooked on it like crack so we're gonna rank this it's a blind tasting I don't know any of the brands are that are here I've never seen the packages yet but we're gonna go through them and try some lemon peel gummies and see just one it's kind of light on the lemon peel but Asian off there where you can get the flavor of it lemon peel gummy beat there's a blue one but I want to try the red one oh so this one I've noticed the texture of the lemon peel is much finer so it's not as clumpy as the first first one mmm it's a totally different gummy it's very sweet compared to the first one that's especially on the level of the gum in the gummy I feel like the lemon peel doesn't come as through as strong as on the first one though lemon peel gummy sea hmm right off the bat it's very light on them in peel like almost non-existent I cannot taste it lemon peel gummy D Oh diva has a face this one is kind of light on the lemon peel - it's almost like a dusting mmm I don't know if I like that one I got cracker cuz we gotta cleanse the palate between gummy bears so I like the cracker where you got the cracker from okay lemon peel gummy e this one oh she is sticky okay this one this one is sticky so we know this one is a wet lemon peel Oh actually I got a double berry I got I got twins here so let's try the twins mm-hmm okay light it's light on the lemon peel favorite flavor but the sticky texture hmm okay I gotta know I get more of the lemon peel taste down this one's almost sour I think it could be the bears that are different but it's the the flavor of the bear kind of works with the lemon peel and it's this one's pretty good lemon peel gummy so this one what Oh what's a different one okay so I'm liking the coverage of the lemon peel on this like completely coats the bear the bear is much is actually smaller too I'm liking the taste of this one the best actually it's very it's very balanced compared to the others go let me lemon peel gummy bear G so last one in our taste test this one tastes like it's been marinating in the min peel for a long time it definitely has that the flavor runs throughout and the chunks are big on this one like I don't know the other ones not so much but like this one you can like definitely see that there's big pieces of lemon peel so if you like lemon peel this might be your one I think I think I think I know which how I'm gonna rank my first on my favorite one that I tasted is gonna be this one this is e F F okay let's see who made this one Oh son sunchang grocery where's that Kaneohe Oh China Town oh oh that's where you get the lemon peel from so that's why I probably tastes the best okay my second one was probably this last one that I tasted this one Oh Lonnie's Lani's okay this is this one was a special delivery - this one's from Hilo and apparently that's where Gump lemon peel gummies are from so if you know somebody in Hilo you know they can pick up Lonnie's for you and send them back but probably got to pay double okay the third one I liked was this one cuz a texture the texture was sticky and I think they use wet lemon peels so who is this one Oh family grocery Oh where's this one oh okay one windward side bear oh that's good okay that's different I like I said it didn't taste that one before most surprising because the ones I normally prefer are the dry but it was pretty good for a wet lemon peel and you know probably got to eat that one with toothpick or chopsticks because though the other ones are dry but that one is gonna stick to your fingers so gotta watch out yeah that's that's my top three [Music] you [Music]", "-xPGRPKIP40": "ladies and gentlemen gummy worm okay watch this now you spelled gummy gmmi okay anyway pear vodka as one that you don't see often

citric acid you can view our ginger recipe right here at magical butter calm let's get goin on a magical butter gummies we are spot this recipe by taking that tincture and pouring it into a saut\u00e9 pan over low heat we're going to cook it until it has the consistency of maple syrup once your attraction has reduced down to about a quarter of a cup begin to stir it in a circular motion now add your flavor extract and your liquid sweetener and continue to stir in a circular motion continue to stir your extract in a circular motion until it returns to that syrup light consistency turn up the heat and let your mixture cool in a large bowl combine your flavored gelatin unflavored gelatin and citric acid and whisk the ingredients together to combine once your extraction has reached room temperature begin to pouring your juice now combined you to some gelatin mixture and whisk thoroughly once completely blended it is important that you let your gelatin bloom for at least 15 to 20 minutes this is my favorite part of this recipe it's time to turn this mixture into magical butter gonna set your temperature to medium-low and begin to cook your mixture until it starts to melt now

magical magical", "3XVZyth777w": "jumbo fella dreamers in today's video I am sharing with you how I make delicious and nutritious homemade gummy bears let's go hit it so for this recipe you're going to need a half of a cup of juice I'm actually making two recipes I'm going to do one that's orange and one that is lime and then you'll need a tablespoon and a half of unflavored gelatin this is my favorite gelatin if you're vegan agar agar would work just fine as well and then you'll need a tablespoon or two of sweetener depending on how sweet you want gummies so maple syrup honey sugar and then if you want a little extra zing to your gummies I actually like adding a drop or two of The Young Living vitality citrus oils but that's totally optional so first you're going to want to get a half of a cup of juice now for this it took me 2 and 1/2 limes and 3/4 of a large orange if you have juice that's pre-made in the refrigerator that's absolutely fine cherry juice pomegranate juice whatever you happen to have even lemon juice would be really good as well depending on how you know what flavor you want your gummies to be so just getting all of my juice squeezed out here and you can see how pretty that orange color is just so nice and then here is the lime juice as well so I'm just going to take one of my juices I'm going to start with the lime one and put it into a pan that's on medium heat and I'm going to add about a tablespoon and a half-ish of maple syrup and a tablespoon and a half of the unflavored gelatin I'm just going to add that to my pot as well and this is where a whisk comes in handy because this can tend to stick to the side of the pan so you really really want to mix it very very well you'll probably be mixing it for a solid minute or so now what you're looking for is for the liquid to kind of become an opaque sort of color and it should get slightly bubbly on top and you don't want to scorch it you don't want it boiling over just kind of keep an eye on it medium heat about a minute is pretty much all it takes so then once that done you want to add your vitality oils you can I meant to put one drop of lime and to came out but that's okay it's very limey and delicious so then I'm just going to pour it into my little jelly gummy molds here these were from the dollar spot at Target probably about five years ago or so but you can get these off of Amazon they actually have really cute ones now where you have gummy worms gummy bears all sorts of different shapes so explore Amazon so once they're filled into the jelly mould you just want to let it sit I'm going to do the same thing for my orange here as well you can let it sit on the counter to cool if you want to do that or if you're impatient like I am you can put it in the refrigerator for about a half hour if you're even more impatient you can put it in the freezer for about ten to fifteen minutes just until they are solid and then you just pop them out and that is it super easy to make healthy gummies that seriously the entire family will love just store them in the fridge and snack on them throughout the week ours only lasts a couple of days because they are just

me [Music] in today's video we're revisiting one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun and the payoff you get to eat the product don't eat too many i'm back in the studio and we could not do a lego gummy video without putting a fun twist on it so i brought jared from gold yeller into the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions i think here's the basic idea okay here's the basics we're going to probably eat the heads off okay and then replace them with lego heads that makes it look like they're talking and then we switch them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy guys and what they're going to do is they get to bite the heads off jared has the courage to be here with us and we're doing lego stop-motion with the kids so he's really brave to be here in the description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone yeah and what do you want to say to dad um okay okay now move your hands out and then push that button right there perfect [Music] okay now push the button this one right here why are you all here no fingers don't eat me goodbye well we want to thank you guys again for joining us for this it's been a year since we lost grant and we just want to thank you for being on this journey with us and continuing to support our projects and the legacy that grant left us grant we really miss you but thanks for what you left us [Music] you", "0MWFW4tKCVY": "so i just want to thank clumsy cakes for joining me we're doing a collab video i am doing the vegan version of uh gummy bears so for the vegan gelatin we're using sea vegetable agar agar this will act as a gelatin for sweetener i'm using more agave i also have some elderberry i say some blue blue tea thingy thing and this blue tea blender is amazing i'll list her etsy shop down below i have some ginger tea spirulina some pineapple juice and i'm also going to juice off some carrots and then i have my gummy bear mold that just came in from amazon so let's make our cheese and get everything all together all right so we have our carrot juice we have our pineapple juice sugar we have our butterfly um tea we have our green tea which i'm gonna add spirulina soup partially aloe vera tea and i'm just gonna add one tablespoon or one or two tablespoons of blue agave you can add whatever you want and i'm also going to add one in a half teaspoon of your agra agar um you have to heat up your liquid first so i'm just going to measure out a fourth cup of everything heat it up and then we're going to make these into beautiful gorgeous uh gummy bears that are natural colors no additives no food coloring and yeah actually just using my measuring cup two ounces is fourth cup you can also use a scale um but i like using my liquid measuring cup and i'm making a mess which is normal all that good old carrot juice just sitting on the counter so this is two ounces i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to add the aggregate and i'm going to do this for every single one just doing a quick photo shoot of everything so you guys can see what it looks like this is for my thumbnail and this looks so pretty it's a purple color um but i know if you add an acid so like a lemon juice or lime juice it turns pink so i'm actually gonna do that but yeah guys these are all the ingredients i'm letting the carrot juice actually half of it is on the stove heating up and then we're gonna add agar agar at all and make our beautiful natural gummy bears so after a couple of minutes on the heat i've heated up the carrot juice you can see it change it color and we're just actually going to add this directly to our dropper or gummy bear mold not our dropper using our dropper you just want to make sure most of your um what is it called i got argos dissolve you can see it but this is very good so i'm just i added in one tablespoon of uh which i'm gonna call it what is this called this stuff agave and then i also added in a half a teaspoon of ginger powder because i love the taste of ginger it's also very medicinal so yeah we're just gonna drop it in there so using our dropper we're just gonna go right in there we're gonna fill it up and we're gonna drop it in our mold this does not hold a lot it's so cute and then you're just gonna repeat this until all of them are full i might not even need all this liquid to be completely honest i'm only going to do three rows of this one and then i'm going to fold do the same process with all the other ones and i'll be back to show you guys what the gummy looks like but same exact process heat your liquid up add one and a half teaspoon of agar agar powder a tablespoon to two tablespoons of your sweetener of choice and yeah that's all and then fill it up in your mold the mold and everything will be listed down in the description bar this one i want to see you guys i want to show you guys how to change the color of this because you see what color it is now we're going to do this in slow motion so for the clear gummies i decided to use some of my hibiscus and rose water it's super easy to make and i'm going to use this to make my clear gummies and i'm also going to fill in the rest of them this tastes and smell just like hibiscus and rose it is so flavorful and then i'm also going to use some of the leftover pineapple juice to fill in the extra so yeah i'm super excited to make this into the clear gummies and then i'll show you guys can you see they're so adorable and cute and jelly you can see the jello consistency they're not too sticky actually and they're so cute look at it so i'm going to take them all out and plate them look at them they're so cute and these are the pineapple ones they're so cute okay so these are all the gummies they're kind of sticking together so i'm gonna rub them with cornstarch as she suggests in her video which is linked down below for those looking to make um gummies out of jello some jellos i think are vegan i would have to double check that and i'll let you guys know down in the description bar but these are what mines look like again i'm using these for vitamin purposes if you're using if you're looking to make a more gummy i will put some other substitutes for gelatin down in the description bar below okay we're going to go through the flavors so this first one right here is a pineapple and carrot the one following it is elderberry this one next to it is carrot this one is pineapple this one is butterfly pea flour tea with key lime this one below it is the butterfly pea without key lime this one is my rose water hibiscus water with a little bit of agave this one's spirulina this one's just green tea and this one is elderberry those are all of the flavors that i created and they look so cute so in regards to flavor my favorite two ones are the butterfly pea little phase three um the pineapple and the elderberry i'm gonna try the green tea one now because i didn't try it yet and then i'll let you guys know yeah so these four right here are my favorite the other ones are just from medicinal like medical not medical but for vitamins because you know you need to consume them every day the best place to store these are in the fridge i'm going to dust mines with a little bit of corn starch so they don't stick together in a little bit of sugar but yeah that's how you make vegan gummy bears they're not super gummy but they

I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "gwIs86fcWps": "hey what's going on guys we're shooting another gummy infused with vodka video I know you guys are probably getting tired of them but some people are still asking for stuff one of the most recent questions was hey you know I don't have any gummy bears but I do have some lifesavers gummies is it the same thing well pretty much I mean we got here gummy collisions two flavors in one so I mean this could actually turn out pretty damn good you know if your party you got two flavors in each one and then plus whatever kind of vodka you decide to use so here today we're using uh some orange smirnoff vodka and the gummy lifesavers shouldn't really be an issue with the lifesavers take a look here just open them up get your little gummy rings same consistency as a normal gummy you know I mean so I I suspect they'll do just about the same thing the only thing you want to watch with theses I guess after they expand they might be pretty big I mean right now they're about the size of a quarter maybe a nickel but uh who knows after a few days it might be like a half-dollar or silver dollar size I mean it's pretty cool so basically all we're gonna do is follow the same recipe even watching on these videos just take your gummies add a bunch of them into your little container and spread them around just depending how many you want to make I mean you can split it up into batches or sort out the color say you want say you want to do all these yellow and green ones with some lime vodka or Citrus Vodka make a separate batch of those then you got your yellow and orange you want to do orange vodka you know but this time we're just going to mix them all together hoping for a pretty good result here just crack open our orange vodka there we go Smirnoff orange basically want to top these guys all off cover them up a little bit more don't be afraid I mean whatever's left over the gummies itself will have kind of dissolved a little bit and that will flavor the vodka so you can always reuse the vodka that's in here if you over pour just you know use a funnel or something filter back in the in a different bottle or you can just put it straight into shot glasses whatever works for you so take a look there they're all submerged got a nice clear line right about where they are with the vodka we're going to be adding more later in a couple days so cover them up each one and go and throw these guys in here for diretor you'll need um probably about three or four days the longer you put them in there the more they'll soak up but it eventually gets to a point where they're just saturated and they start to dissolve so don't go anything more than about a full week so go ahead open my fridge got some other ones there for a party coming up this Friday so those are a different batch take our gummy gummy saver rings with our orange vodka throw them in the fridge and like I said every couple days just give them a good stir and see what kind of progress you what's going on guys we're back here now with the second experiment as far as a gummy infused vodka goes or vodka infused gummies I guess um this one I decided to do lifesaver rings lifesaver gummy rings or whatever a lot of people were saying you know depending on where you live it's kind of hard to find certain types of candy and this was one that somebody sent in and asked me to do so that like I said we got the lifesavers gummy rings this was like a fruit fusion blend or something or they're like two flavors per gummy um I would say they turned out okay they've grown a bit I mean just because I guess how dense they are like the shape of them you won't really notice as much expansion as the rest because it's you know it's in a ring but it's got quite a thick little border there they did grow soaked up quite a bit of the vodka I've already kind of drained them off a little bit that way you can get a better idea of how they look um texture wise I'll check one out here split this guy still still gummy still chewy if you look in there nice little center still soft chewy like I said two flavours I decided to do orange vodka with this so let me take a bite well yeah these ones are good really good they have a little bit more sweetness than most regular gummy bears I don't know if it's because the type of candy maybe there's more fruit juice inside of these but you know they turned out really good I would recommend these ones for the party um so I let them soak for about three days separated them every couple days start them shook them up added a little bit more vodka just because it was about halfway I always want to keep them topped off so they absorb evenly but this is a really good one I would recommend this for a party now pretty

descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak

want old Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I swear my fingers were screaming it felt like delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste 100% was aquitted flammable liquid napalm it was actually a bit humorous for a nanosecond as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible and it went on for hours I felt violated what it was over which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day there was still Tommy out of me that I ate a my wedding in 2005 high five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasty Albers so I told her friends about what definitely enema dig it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands silly woman the horrendous sounds a demon screaming your gut is like an alarm clock without the snooze button do not lollygag when you hear them chant you just run

a strainer we need filter choose for the next time please discard the residue [Music] pour the juice into a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of agar agar mixed agar agar well [Music] and let it set for five minutes heat the mixture on the medium flame until the agar-agar gets dissolved in the solution do not over boy it would take this couple of minutes switch off the flame and add one teaspoon of honey check the consistency if we feel it as little thick then just add one or two teaspoon of water it should be a free-flowing consistency pour the solution using the dropper into the mold this dropper and mold is a set which is available on Amazon to buy [Music] called the solution carefully if you see any air bubbles and pop them using a safety pin planes this mold in the refrigerator for 15 minutes [Music] the final step is popping them out gently press them all using your fingers and pop the gummy bear out we can make 50 gummies in the mold at once [Music] see how cute they look my

button [Applause] [Music] for the DP recipe go on to home food best food calm thanks for watch", "6-aM3IwqpJg": "[Music] first you're gonna start by cutting your apples into chunks make sure you cut out the seeds I mean obviously but you can leave some of the skin on there depends everybody said hey to my son Mason he's watching and waiting he's so excited about his gummies so I'm gonna speed it up right here for you guys to see me cut it up [Music] and here comes my daughter Milan she doesn't like gummy so well so these will be mainly for Mason up and there she goes playing hmm now you're going to put a little bit of water into the mixture with the apples and blend them I'm using a nutribullet there's my son still waiting for his gummies you're gonna puree it until it's liquid next you're gonna add some spinach hey Mason um you're gonna chop that up the reason why I add the spinach afterwards I just want to make sure the apples are all blended together before I add that spinach in there now you're gonna add a little bit of lime or lemon juice all right so after you blend that together I like to put it through a strainer because there's always that one little piece that did not blend well so you can put it in cheesecloth or whatever and strain it out next you wanna add raw honey three tablespoons or a little bit more depending on how sweet you want it if your child is at least one years of age if they are younger than that I would go for agave nectar [Music] now you're going to mix in three and a half to four tablespoons of beef gelatin I ordered this off Amazon it's my favorite because it's very very healthy it's a grass-fed cow it's more healthy than that jell-o stuff you find in the store and it's good for your hair skin and nails you're just gonna mix that up until it gets kind of thick now you're going to put it on low heat low to medium heat you do not want this to boil because it'll get foamy on top and that just won't make the gummies look good you're gonna stir it until it becomes a liquidy consistency [Music] I would say once you can't stir the bubbles out anymore then you're done these are my gummy bear silicone molds I'm gonna take my dropper and I'm going to suction it up and I'm just going to drop it into the silicone molds like this [Music] once they're all full I leave them on the counter for about three minutes put them in the fridge for about thirty minutes or until set and once they are set you can just pop them out I'm gonna show you in a second just like that see they pop right out and I give him right to my side and he loves them and they're healthy full of spinach and apples and everything good so now you can enjoy to store them you can put them in a glass container with a lid and put them in the fridge", "yl6vBuP23bE": "hey guys welcome back to my channel and to my kitchen today I'm doing another kids mommy video and I'm doing DIY snacks for kids I mean I guess they snacks work for all types of kids but I would say like toddler age and up these are snacks that you know all of us loved I'm sure as kids like fruit roll-ups and goldfish and things like that but it's kind of nice to know all the ingredients that are going into what you're feeding your children especially when it comes to snacks because just like every other toddler or most toddlers my son can be picky about what he eats like he doesn't like me and he like definitely does not like veggies I tried my hardest to like feed him the ones that he will eat umm but yeah I mean he definitely loves snacks and he's always asking me for snacks that's him ho goodness I bet you he wants a snack anyway so today I'm making ki a do-it-yourself snacks that I found on Pinterest so this is kind of like a Pinterest hacks video just sharing with you guys some of the things that I pinned I pinned a lot when I was pregnant I did a ton of pinning when I was pregnant hoping that I would definitely get around to it at some point and so now that he's a toddler I'm definitely trying out some of the ideas like the you know the fun little games and do-it-yourself crafts and food and snacks and things like that so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and yeah we'll just jump right in so snacks are great and all and I definitely love to treat Oliver to crackers and various bars and things like that but I always tried to maintain um you know fruits and vegetables as much as I can in his diet he really really loves berries he does love carrots and cucumbers so I make these little snack pods you can add anything you want to these snack pods it could be cubes of cheese and pretzels but I try to do really really healthy options since I know my son will just devour berries I will have a side for berries and then cucumber and some carrots and I will put it in these little snack pods and if he asks me for a snack which he'll usually come over and let me know like hey mom I want a snack or I'll ask if he wants a snack I will have a few of these ready to go they're only good once you cut the veggies and fruit for about maybe three days so I will pre make these and offer it to him if he asks me for a snack if he doesn't finish it all I'll put it back in the refrigerator but I just like to have these healthy options ready to go on hand and just I know with the cucumber it's already cut it's just the perfect size for him to eat snack pods are definitely a quick and easy way to feed your toddler something healthy and even older kids you could definitely put this in their lunch boxes next up we have fruit roll-ups which I've been seeing all over Pinterest and just dying to make for Oliver because I remember I used to love fruit roll-ups so I will have the full ingredient list of course in the description but basically it's just honey which I have this this Honey that I get from sprouts and some organic berries and I put that all in my food processor and just process that away and then I just you're just gonna pour it on Silpat and you're gonna actually cook it and it you're gonna bake it for I think it's about six hours it's definitely a long time so keep in mind that it's basically just dehydrating it so after what seems like an eternity in the oven you're going to take it out and it's actually dehydrated at that point which is fabulous because you can just pull it right off the baking sheet and then you're going to put it on to some parchment paper and then you're just going to roll it just like you do with the traditional fruit roll-ups and then I like to cut it to make them smaller portions there's another option that you can choose to do and that's to strain the seeds looking back that might be something I do if I ever make this again in the future which I do think I will do because my son really really liked this a lot he's a big fan of berries on their own and this is just berries with a little honey you can add more or less to your taste but these were pretty tart so they weren't SuperDuper sweet and he still really liked them as like a special treat or snack and especially if you're potty training or you're around that age this is a great snack or treat if they've used the potty or you know it's good reinforcement so the bottom line is that I'm a big fan of these and I definitely divided them I didn't give them all to him at once because he went crazy and wanted more and more and more but I just I don't know brought me back to my childhood and how much I loved fruit roll-ups and I was glad that he liked him and just to know what actually went inside of them um but yeah big hit next we are making homemade goldfish which is another one that I saw on Pinterest and just had to try and I was so amazed by this recipe I just loved it so again full recipe will be in the description but I'm just adding cheddar cheese and some flour now of course if there's a type of flour that you like to use for your children you can certainly use that and make it even more of a healthy option I just like that these are made from home and obviously just some butter and a little bit of salt and then again I'm gonna put it in the food processor and just go ahead and just process it until you really start to see the color come out the cheese and you'll see that the cheese will really start to make its appearance as it becomes more and more orange so I'm going to go ahead and remove the top of the food processor I'm going to take a spatula and just kind of push everything down in the middle and go ahead and just process it one more time through to just make sure it's really really smooth you just want like a sandy texture and then I'm going to remove the top again and slowly add a little bit of water I believe it's a tablespoon at a time and we're going to do two so I'm going to add a little bit I'm going to run it through the food processor take off the top add a little bit again run it through the food processor and then we're going to have the dough that we need to make our goldfish with a spatula I'm going to take the dough out of the food processor and on to some plastic wrap because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes while the dough chills in the refrigerator be sure to set your oven to 350 degrees which is the temperature that it needs to be at when you cook after the dough has chilled for 30 minutes you're going to roll the dough out and then these taste very very similar to cheez-its and also goldfish so you can make squares if you want I actually made a little fish out of a Perrier can and used that to create the little fish now obviously it's bigger and thicker than a traditional goldfish but it tasted just like it and I have to say I even got my chef husband to approve he was eating them and he said wow those tastes really really good they tasted just like cheez-its and goldfish we were so blown away so I just created a bunch of little cutouts and put it on to a baking sheet and I'm gonna bake it for about 15 minutes so it doesn't take very long at all I left it in for about 17 minutes because I felt like at 15 minutes it needed a little bit longer so I would say 16 minutes is probably the perfect amount to bake depending on the temperature of your oven and how your oven works exactly but about between 15 and 17 minutes I added a little bit of salt on top and this is obviously a special treat that looked like a lot of salt but it really wasn't that much I promise um this was a special treat for Oliver and I loved them he loved them Byron loved them they were definitely a hit for the family so I would definitely try these out it just it feels good to know that you made even if it's kind of a guilty pleasure snack like you made it at your own home and you know everything that went in there so yeah those were a hit so I don't know about your house but in my house we definitely love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I I mean come on doesn't every toddler love a peanut butter and jelly sandwich so when my son goes to Grandma's house um she always has the Uncrustables and she feeds them to him because he loves them so I'm like I could make that obviously I don't like to waste so I do eat the edges cuz I just feel bad throwing it away but I do make this little airplane shape um kind of like Uncrustables peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for Oliver and he just loves them I mean the perfect size you can pre make them he always plays with them because he thinks they're actually like airplanes so he'll like make the noise like right now he's making the noise going but it's just a fun really easy very very easy I think most mom's kind of do this for their kids um peanut butter and jelly sandwich are definitely a hit so I get those at Target you can get those cut outs and then finally we have fruit snacks which again fruit snacks are another super yummy treat for kids but it's good to know that you're making them at home and you're kind of controlling the ingredients that go in there so I'm starting again with a food processor I have frozen berries that I've just kind of been sitting out for a little bit so they're not super super frozen so I have the berries and I went ahead and processed those I'm going to put those into a pan a stovetop pan and I'm going to cook it on medium to low heat I'm adding some lemon juice and a little bit of honey so in the saucepan you're going to heat the strawberries and the lemon juice and honey and then you're going to float once that gets hot you're going to slowly add some gelatin just slowly add a little bit at a time and whisk it in there and the key is to really add a little bit at a time and make sure it is thoroughly absorbed so that you don't get lots and lots of clumps so I'm going to go ahead and do that you're going to let it reduce a little bit and then you're going to put it in a pan and then you're just going to stick it in the refrigerator and let it refrigerate for about eight hours or overnight so essentially these are basically like jello but it was reduced a little bit more so it's even chewier like a fruit snack it's similar to a fruit snack but it resembles jello a little bit more for me and I left it out and it was a little warm and it kind of melted I cut them into squares but you could cut different shapes out you can kind of do whatever you want with them but again with this recipe very similar to the fruit roll-up recipe I probably would have preferred if I strained the seeds and didn't have the seeds in there but I will say they tasted really tangy not as sweet as a traditional fruit stat snack and my son still really really liked them he ate them and really enjoyed them so I'll maybe try a little bit of a different method and tweak it next time but um yeah I mean those were a hit as well so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and if you did thumbs up subscribe to my channel check out my last two videos and

classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so

consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a

the other half and I'm soaking it to get all the salt and debris out so I saw one YouTube where she had already prepared it so then I had to figure out okay well how do you prepare it I didn't know that you had to wash it and all this kind of crap so that's what this process is with the lemon and the water now I don't have any idea what I'm doing I've had to look online several times to get a recipe for CMOS gummies and there isn't really one that specific and none of them tell you how to soak this stuff ahead of time I got this kit for the elderberry syrup on Etsy from this company natural mama so it comes with the elderberry ingredients and instructions and it comes with the gummy instructions and this tray it does not come with this syringe already had it so that's what I'm gonna use to get the liquid in here to cool it I'm adding the sea moss so I'm trying to figure out how to prepare it to then be added into my syrup so that I can put it all together if you go to my youtube channel you'll see my review of CMOS gummies that I bought online so I'm just trying to make this myself because they're expensive and it only lasts two weeks because there's no preservatives before they go back you I soak that CMOS for four hours and I blended it with water you need a powerful blender probably a Vitamix would be best but this is with a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle of water plus a little extra so and this is how thick it gets and this one half of this expands and this is you get all of this so I don't know what I'm gonna do with all of this I do not need all this I'm gonna have to find some other recipes to use it with this is eight tablespoons of syrup one tablespoon of gelatin 1 tablespoon of female you", "bvS8ERoCwIw": "we'll test the great taste of Haribo gold

seconds and I'll be right back okay so this is right up right out the microwave so I don't know if you guys could tell but it melted a lot so I'm just gonna mix this and if you guys can see this is very very thick and we kind of want it a little bit more runny so I'm gonna add more Chum winter do you wanna just okay so that I wanna say that's kind of the consistency we're going for it I'm gonna do this much I only did a little bit because I don't want to make too much so now I'm gonna get my container and I'm gonna pour my gentlemen with my gummy bears in there and I'm just using the Walmart

in my powder so I'm gonna first start with this what the cool powders that I showed you guys right here and I'm just gonna drizzle it all over it okay I'm gonna use the particular eco Clady powder now I'm giving you stacking and I mean this just depends all on your preference you like a lot of time if you don't like it too spicy I'm gonna use the Valentina seasoning I'm using all the seasonings my short jaw in the beginning of the video I'm using super Rico and I'm gonna use a little bit of Miguelito I'm actually you put just a little bit more Tajin in it okay so now you want to cover your

show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of the gummy bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down

kita guy if this is the first time you happen to see me my name is giuseppe i'm 47 years old and i have been following the keto lifestyle the keto way of eating but not diet since the 15th of july 2018 and i'm really happy of this choice he gave me back life i was affected by fibromyalgia arthrosis arthritis yeah and thanks to keto i solved the mood and now i feel like a lion a lot of energies in this channel you can find most of the time uh recipes converted into keto ones italian and non-few non-italian recipes whenever it is possible when i started to eat keto i found really boring to eat always the same food meat fish eggs eggs fish meat and so the idea came to my mind why don't try to convert the delicious italian recipes and also not the other ones into keto recipes whenever it is possible so the channel was born and thanks to you is getting the the success it deserves today i'm going to show you the keto gummy bears bears yeah and do not abuse of this recipe the keto is completely something else you know fat and protein good so the source of fat and protein this one is just just like you know when you have wheel of something sweet and i don't know unusual let's jump straight into the recipe and then we'll do some consideration on the carbs let's start our recipe by adding four sheets of gelatine into cold water if you have the power at one i think 12 grams should be enough then now let's pour yes you got it is just that the orange 100 ml what have you done the orange keep following pour the orange juice into a small tall and narrow saucepan and then one teaspoon of alright little or you could you could use stevia it's up to you then uh switch the fire on and keep stirring until the uh the sweetener has completely melted into the liquid then add the gelatin remember to squeeze it first the soft gelatin and then keep stirring until also the gelatin dissolves into the orange juice i use some some silicone mold with their shape and you can use whatever you want just don't use a bigger sides bigger sides is better that you don't use and now is the first fruit the frozen one i used so the same procedure put some water as well to help the unfreezing they will release their delicious juice i put definitely more water than these the tablespoon of sweetener it's up to you if you want to have put more yeah now we have to use a immersion blender to blend the forest fruit so that they will be turned into a liquid and then you can add the more water according if the liquid is too thick yeah i'm adding the gelatin the procedure is the same the soft gelatin and then you could decide to put more water if the liquid is too thick do not put too much sweetener because for example the right ritual becomes crystals and then the the gummy bears will lose their transparency they will become opaque it's up to you i used one tablespoon it was enough for me and here they are let's enjoy them now a bit just a bit okay remember the carbs here we are as usual our tasting stage i feel them here the teddy bears quito gummy teddy bears literally melt in the mouth and of course i can taste the orange but then there is also the forest fruit taste i use some bigger silicone mold those are the mold i the silicone mold i used found on amazon the italian one okay let's talk about carbs now the orange oh what have you done the orange is forbidden in keto what are you doing yes it's true the orange is forbidden but we did the trick of using just a bit of the juice in the um what i mean we don't we are not going to eat the whole set of uh gummy keto gummy bears candies so of course so those are 100 ml uh which contain 10.4 grams of carbs are redistributed in the whole uh candies gum yeah candies so i think we are not going to eat them all so definitely we can use some orange juice or lemon juice for example to create those delicious keto gummy gummy bear gummy candies yeah they're not bears in this case anyway and the same for the lemon the lemon 100 ml of um lemon contain 9 gram of carbs so if you don't eat the whole candies the whole set of candies we can definitely use orange and lemon and we can make also the cola the cola taste of course you can use the zero coca-cola the diet cake coke sorry diet coke in italy we have a zero coke zero i don't know if in your country is the same but anyway look at the the label there should be only aspartame as the the sweetener so you can use straight away you can pour the the cola the coke sorry the coke into the saucepan and regarding the sweetener i'm not sure if you if the aspartame is sweet enough so maybe you can do some tests and you can let me know in the comments below if you add a party aspartame you need to add another sweetener so suer lokanto arrightritel stevia whatever let me know in the comments below so i'm not sure so in this way we can eat some fruit that is not allowed in keto i use also the forest fruit maybe you can use some others strawberry i know lemon orange those comes to my mind right now anyway whatever you do let me know in the comments below keep an eye on the carbs and do not eat the whole set of candies this way you will enjoy fruit even though remaining in ketosis in quito and we can leave our keto in a more pleasant way in a more funny way nicer way so to say if you like the video please subscribe by smashing the button

sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give

month and a half now I started off with the goal in mind and that's just to lose weight for a party and to fit into a dress that I loved I've also started experimenting recently with recipes that make the herb my Herbalife experience just that much more rewarding today's recipe will be jet liftoff jello shots they're energizing they taste great and they make really really cool you know items to make for your friends or into wellness or into fitness maybe you want to make it for your fitness class which is what I did I made it for my dance class okay quickly in order to make these jello liftoff shots you're going to need a couple of ingredients of course you're going to need your your jello cups so you're you're jealous shot cups with lids included I have about 25 here once this video is over I end up actually making about double so I end up making about 50 with this particular recipe I did take out four fruit punch jello flavors I bought my jello in bulk which makes it a little bit more economical for you and I also did a correspond the corresponding liftoffs which are these little tablets right here they do come from Herbalife and they're called tropical fruit force these correspond really really well with that with that that strawberry flavor or you know a jello flavor just like that has something it's some kind of fruit in it so that these two fruit punches and the liftoff worked really well together and have eight tablets and I also have your measuring cup in water you're gonna need plenty of water I used filtered water by the way so I'm coming over to the stove I am boiling my water on the stove letting it get really really nice and hot and I do have the fire on high as I do that I'm going to start by actually throwing in the liftoff tablets again I had eight tablets for this particular recipe I'm gonna put them all in the pot and I'm going to allow it to boil with the boiling water so before the water becomes comes to a full full bowl let's go ahead and add your lift off your liftoff tablets to the boiling water I went ahead and I grab my trusty wooden spoon and I'm gonna go ahead and stir the liftoff tabs I'm using a wooden spoon instead of a metal spoon it's it's gonna be better for use in boiling water so go ahead and use a wooden spoon or a plastic spoon and and kind of forego those metal spoons so I stirred it I'm stirring it as much as possible making sure that the tablets are dissolved really really well so just stir into it's all dissolved and you no longer see tablets your water will turn color colors as you see it's going to turn the color of the liftoff tab okay I've already started dissolving my jello packages in the boiling water this is my second bag I'm just you know it's a little messy and so be careful make sure you open the bag all the way especially all the way at the top so that's my second bag I'm dissolving I'm gonna go ahead and dissolve my third bag that's three again I'm gonna use four bags total so that went in pretty nice and smooth and a little mist and then this is gonna be my fourth bag of jell-o then I'm getting in my wooden spoon again and I'm going in to stir it all together so now I'm stirring the the jello the gelatin and I'm also mixing and mixing with that that liftoff solution that you saw earlier that was a little yellow so now it's no longer yellow and you have that red jello color which will be the same color as our jello shots you're gonna continue stirring for about two minutes until your jello is completely dissolved you could go ahead and turn off the heat at this time after it's dissolved just go ahead and start stirring in your cold water this would be my second cup of cold water as you can see I'm going back and forth to the refrigerator I'm actually using filtered water from our refrigerator I decided not to use water that came that comes from the sink much where they use bottled water or filtered water so this is my filtered water that I'm adding that's already cold it's ice cold pretty much from being in the refrigerator so this is my second glass or second cup I'm going to go to the refrigerator about I think a total five times we're going to do five cups of water you can do four cups you can do five cups I decided to put a little bit less water I believe the recipe actually called a forum about four cups of water but since I put a little bit more water in the original boiling water I'm going to put a little bit less watering at this time so I actually put about four cups of cold water now the next step is will be to just line a pan I'm gonna line up in a cookie sheet pan actually with aluminum foil and that's just to keep the mess down I'm gonna go ahead and start putting my jello shop Cup so I'm lining them up on the foil just line them up again um directly on this foil if I forgot to mention I am using two outs jell-o shot cups you can use two ounces you can use four ounces you know they have eight ounces I just have to use the two ounces to give people a little bit more of an option if they didn't want you know so much of a liftoff if they don't want it to be as strong or they wanted something light that they would have option with the smaller cups okay so going back to my water which has cooled down significantly you know from me out in the cool water I want to use that same cup I used before to add the cold water and I'm just gonna scoop it in directly into my pot and from there I'm going to go start filling my two ounce jello shot cuts with the solution with a little liquid which is the liftoff plus the jello so I'm gonna go ahead and fill it up I'm gonna fill it up about 3/4 of the way maybe a little bit less than 3/4 you don't want to fill it up of course to the top but you also want to make sure that there's enough in there so people will be to you know dip it out or lick it out with their tongue which is very helpful when you're doing jello shots this is pretty much what you end up with I was actually able to do that about two more times so I was a lot more cups again than I originally thought I was going to have but that was great anyway after I finished with that I went ahead and I just put my cups in the refrigerator I was careful as not to waste the jello some of it did ways but thank goodness for the foil I put in the refrigerator and I was good to go to let it set for about four to six hours once I let the jello shots sit in the refrigerator for about four to six hours you want to go ahead and put the top securely on them and this way if you keep the tops on there you can actually keep your jello shots in your refrigerator for up to a week without it going you know with it still having a good consistency so I hope you enjoyed my how-to video again here are the ingredients that you're going to need if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comments box and now at the recipe in the description box below thank you", "fvKzpfkqD7Q": "- [Man] Gummy bear shot glasses. No, we've never made these before, they're super cool, super fun, okay. You've got to try this. We start with some blue gummy bears, packing them into our shot glass mold that we got on Amazon. You have to pack these tight, homeboy. Okay, got 'em all up in there, blue, red, orange, yellow, green. I know some of you are going \"Why would you make\ngummy bear shot glasses?\" Why did man walk on the moon? Because we could! That's raspberry vodka, peach schnapps, what we're making here is\na white gummy bear shot. Sweet and sour, combined\nwith some lemon-lime soda. There are tons of recipes\nfor this out there, so you might see a little variation. Don't call me complaining like \"No, that's not the correct recipe.\" Just roll with it, okay. So we let 'em cool down\nand we take 'em out. Right, solid. Good to go. Now we worked these glasses\nthe hell out, oh boy. We packed these up with\nbooze, we see like, they soaked, okay. That's like shot number five. It's a cheap date for me on my diet. Oh, I'm hungry. I'm hungry and I'm going in! Like a savage, okay. That's right, homeboy, I eat like a savage just to show you I'm\nserious, I was hungry. It's a cheap date like I said, okay.

whole bunch of out of the way and mentioned that this drink was exclusive to three states so good luck finding it you don't know if those dates are look it up at siddi dx.com and go from there quick note to mention after I finish the lemon lime review and notice it in the glass there seem to be cloudiness the not the typical cloudiness that you get from I don't know just any old energy drink my suspect shun my suspicion of the drink being mixed with a carbonated beverage so in other words they took Sunny D and some other carbonated beverage and just put them together was probably true because the it's like the drink settled within the can and it got dumb very particle e cloudy it was not like a cloudy like it came that way it was like a cloudy like it's settled little tiny little specks of broken up sunny d so we will investigate that today I will stick the camera straight into the glass because we're cool like that so anyways give you these specs back here this time I'm actually going to check them out to see how they can to this beverage so one so this one's got two more gram or one more gram of sugar the null lemon lime it seems like they took carbonated water sir krause a glucose syrup and two percent or less of each of the following concentrate juices orange apple grapefruit all that energy from a distinct blend of three sugars which is weird because I guess they're replacing the caffeine the energy blend has to be pretty powerful to its new sugar the three types of sugar have to be working together quite well to make up the difference of a caffeine I'm assuming that for me I would have to drink all three of these flavors today which I guess I am to feel any buzz at all and when you don't necessarily get the caffeine it doesn't matter how many of these you drink you're not going to get rid of the caffeine withdrawals caffeine what roles exist for a reason you don't caffeine in a drink you're not going to get rid of the withdrawals migraines headaches whatever you want to call them so yeah silver tabs on all three of them I could review them all at once but it'd be nauseating and maybe you don't want to watch one review maybe you're only interested in one of the flavors otherwise that would be perfect if I could get them all out in a way I can get them a lot of the way it once but you know so then again some people might like literally be only interested in one flavor so that's no like I said it's just better individually I unless I'm mixing them so it kind of smells funky like really funky smells like fruit punch yes but it's got a bit of a scent that I'm not quite sure what it is I don't really know it's kind of like a vitamin C smell not really sure that's a good thing at all I mean it's actually I know for a fact it's not a good thing it's just kind of answering that one wash it in with that one okay let's pour it out at this time I'm not going to spill any because I hate when that happens alright so this one comes out really freaking pretty and like its other one it matches very well with a can which looks like a lava to the very cool and then we're going to stick the cancer it in there I mean the camera right in there canned camera you can see okay I don't know if this one's going to do it but if not we'll do it later because it seemed like it was apparent toward the end and when I move the glass around so check this out I don't see it doing it with this one but then again it's not my own eyes and looking through the cameras view and the camera can see things differently well the display can see things differently not necessarily I'll see if it's doing it with my i'll actually see if it's really really doing it when i take a sip okay so it's not doing with this one maybe later toward the end of a drink i know it was like the back the very bottom of the glass so another glass is clean so that's that's pretty much anyways yeah so it tastes like fruit punch and die basically really it's Kasich for punch just like a fruit punch that you don't even know I don't even know if it's comparable to like a nostril punch or a kool-aid fruit punch but it's it's definitely fruit punch and it's it tastes a little weird but in a punchy way I don't know it's like it's good it's maybe not the best fruit punch I've ever had but it's it's decent them yeah pretty much it I score wise i'm feeling like mmm like a 9.4 know it's a little less impressive but more of the same definitely preferred it tastes like Monster Ball is blend but not as not as powerful it's a little bit like almost like a sugar-free version yeah sugafree bowlers blend that's what it tastes like so if you need a good example there you go also but it also has more of that same awkward sunnyd mixed with carbonated beverage taste overall why I'm even giving it a high score just because it's good the way I describe it may be that doesn't sound appealing but when you're drinking it it's good you can finish it it's definitely not terrible and it's worthy of it someone crazy would say that if they were more like cruel to their drinks and after all the drinks they do all my reviews would change based on this but I would say that this is a 7.6 and everything else would fall like down there that's like if I was being you know compared an energy drink scale it's the 7.6 but as far as this flavor and as far as you know and I don't mean it but that goes for all the other ones don't take any of the other scores I've ever mentioned like how I give drinks tens and 9s it I just gave the amp a 10 that would rank is like like an eight for me amongst all energy drinks so there's ways that you're supposed to like it's like how you're comparing it to like for that moment versus all the other ones that you've ever had in your whole life it's like a rank rather than a score so yeah anyways check out the a little bit more and it's cool i like that sunny DS tried this and that kind of wish it was available for everybody so anyways that's pretty much that let me see hmm now this particular one did not break up or have issues so never mind no okay good that's pretty much it you can pretty much get fruit punch sunday d i'm pretty sure and probably make this yourself i know that a lot of you might want to get some of my drinks that I review and because i have so many it was like where does he get these and can he send them to me because it'd be easier that way I mean I'm like an ebay at this point but i just don't sell and I don't trade i'd rather sell them trade so offer me money and i'll take that but maybe not you know i mean but it is true if i did sell every energy drink I review it I'd be rich like and if i could sell every cell 12 packs or cases to you guys for each drink like let's say boom cell of case of this every different guy review there's case no I get them individually and it would cost me way too much to make my own cases and I wouldn't work out but individuals sure but then shipping is there's no deal so I always told you guys that this would be quicker so it is see you guys next time peace", "1PTvRxfVKKE": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty

good\nrecipe today I'm gonna show you how to make sour\ngummy candy this stuff tastes better than the one get store and it's really easy to make you just need a few ingredients.  for the\nwet ingredients one cup of apple juice and one half cup of corn syrup for the dry ingredients you need a six-ounce pack of Jell-O or 2 three ounce packs.  today I'm trying it with strawberry and you need a matching pack of Kool-Aid.  ideally you should have the same flavor. you can mix and match but until you get the hang of this I would stick with the same flavors Jell-O/Kool-Aid combinations that work: Grape/Grape Lime/Lemon-Lime Cherry/Cherry Watermelon/Fruit-Punch you need four envelopes of gelatin.  if you\nstart making this regular which you might it's going to be cheaper if you get the twelve packs and you need some citric acid (1 tablespoon or 15ml) this you can buy at any pharmacy or\nchemist depending on what part of the world\nyou're in and but they might have to order it for you but it's usually takes a day or so it's\ndefinitely worth the wait. so what you're going to do is turn the heat on to medium, about. that's not going to burn the pot, don't worry about it the liquid is going to be in pretty quick. you get one cup of clear unsweetened apple juice. if it's a little short or over, it doesn't matter then get 1/2 cup of golden corn server and measure that pour that in now for this recipe you should have a silicon spatula it just makes life just so much easier for\nall of it give that a brief stir and just let that come to a full boil over medium heat while the liquids are heating up, I'm going to prepare the dry ingredients start with the Jell-O, cut the pack open get that in a bowl with a tablespoon next the Kool-Aid. there's no particular way to mix this up so it doesn't matter how you do it then the gelatin. I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "x8UW3AYy9VY":

you're waiting for like more people to join because you have like these like a maximum like it's either 10 or like maybe four people so and then i always joined like almost like nine players to 10 so and then i joined and then um so we have to figure out who's the imposter so if if the impostor kills someone and you turn into a ghost and you try to have to do all the tasks to win tasks i mean and find the imposter yeah and the other p people have to report the body and the imposters can vent like go through um like vents and then um um the crewmates can like uh pool mates yeah crewmates they can press an emergency button and they can report the body and find out who is the imposter and then they just go floating around when they they so does the imposter like try to take you out like try to kill you in the game uh um or do you just have to figure out who it is yeah you have to figure out like the crewmates like one imposter if and impossible because you're really good if the imposter kills you you turn into a ghost and you have to finish all tasks to win if you're a see you ghost and you can't um like help anyone and you can text in the game but if you're a ghost you cannot text no one can see you yeah it's like serious like in two if there's two girls a ghost and there's one more ghost so three ghosts you can talk to the two other goats ghosts because they're ghosts you lost me at ghost your mind you should try these gummies these are supposed to be zombie gummies you know actually quite tasty and they're not too sweet so which is good oh man oh good i think i'm gonna try

next time", "rVcAB1C-yig": "[Music] hey guys welcome back today we're gonna be making infuse pika pika style candy so all the candy I'm using in the video are infused gummies that I have made in previous videos and I will link how to make them all below but of course you could still use this recipe even with regular gummies the combination of chamoy and tehy is so amazing I'm so in love with it I'm pretty much covering all my candy today and my favorite ones were the gutters oh my god is so good with the gushers I absolutely love it I ate so many of them so I had to make some regular one to two so I didn't eat too many of the infused runs a lot of things recipes use something called a Lucas candy usually it's a mango or watermelon flavored one now in Canada is really hard to find so I just looked up the ingredients online and figured out how to substitute it and I'll show you guys how to do that in this video [Music] here's what you're gonna need a variety of infused candy or not infused it's up to you all of these are gummies I have made slash infused and I have videos for them on my channel so I'll post the links for each of them below some Tajin chamoy and powdered sugar now these next ingredients are optional but they're commonly used in pika-pika style gummies it's definitely not essential but it does add a nice little extra flavor as well as a bit of sourness if you like that if you're familiar with making these gummies you've probably have already guessed that that ingredient is the Lucas candy powder all commonly in the watermelon or mango flavor unfortunately that's not something I could find in Canada which is really disappointing because it looks delicious and I really wish I could try it but I looked at the ingredients and pretty much it's sugar salt citric acid and chili powder as well as artificial flavor that will be mango or watermelon depending but since I can't find it we are going to use sugar citric acid and chili powder if you like you can also use watermelon or mango flavoring oil but I did not have any on hand you'll notice that I haven't given any measurements and that's because this recipe is entirely to taste but I'll try to give the approximate amounts that I was using here I have about 1/3 of a cup of icing sugar and I'm gonna pour in some chamoy now less is more because you can always add more but you can't take it out once you've added too much so if you do add too much just add in some more icing sugar to compensate you want very little you want this mixture be very sticky I used approximately one and a half tablespoons of joy so once I mixed it all together I'm going to put in the microwave for about 20 seconds to melt it so I can stir it and get this really nice glossy delicious looking mixture and then we're just going to stir and press out those clumps of icing sugar now I'm adding in about three tablespoons of regular granulated sugar if you're using one of the mango or watermelon Lucas powders you don't need to add the extra sugar and the citric acid and chilli powder I'm going to add but you can if you like - like I said it all comes down to personal preference with taste so you add whatever works for you and now I'm heading about half a teaspoon of citric acid my taste testers told me it was a little bit too sour so if you are sensitive to sour maybe use 1/4 or 1/8 of a teaspoon now I'm adding in chili powder that's about half a teaspoon as well more of this would have been good it doesn't make much of a difference if you're using the Tiki in any way I recommend adding more if you prefer it to be a little bit more chewy and spicy if you wanted to use the watermelon or mango flavoring oil you would added min now just a couple drops will do now I'm just grabbing a little container that has a lid and I'm throwing my first set of gummies which is the peach rings and then I'm gonna drizzle on just a little bit of this mixture again less is more you can always add more but you can't take it back I've made this before with too much and ends up just being a goopy mess so just do a little bit really less than you think you need and then shake shake shake shake a bunch and if it still is not coated then you can add a little bit more I use a very small amount on this you can see they're all very well covered and then now we're going to sprinkle our tajin on and again this is to taste so you can add a little bit shake it up try them and see if you want to add more you can add in some extra sugar some citric acid some chili powder it all comes down to what you like you can experiment with different batches and see what your taste preferences are muy bien they look wonderful the hardest part of this whole thing is trying to not eat them all while you're making them but I had to have some restraint since they are infused on that note for extra strong candies you can throw in some tincture or infused oil or infuse sugar or anything along those lines into your chamoy mixture and that will make them extra strong although I don't recommend using coconut oil because I think you could taste it but tincture would work wonderfully and I do have a great recipe for it which I will post below as well anyways I am now doing the exact same thing but with the gushers and my favorite today rego adding some extra sugar and then some citric acid and some chili powder and I'm pretty sure I'd go and grab more sugar off-camera because I just like it real sweet and then we go shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake until they're all nice and covered oh yeah looking good looking good and then we're gonna add the Dean this is where I should have also been adding the extra sugar and the chili powder citric acid etc I don't know why I added it with the sauce in the end it doesn't really matter but it is important to do the sauce first and then the tahini after when you have the extra sugar or the citric acid or chili powder really doesn't make much of a difference so yeah so we're loading that up with some bean shake it up and there we go beautiful while we're here let's get a little close-up of those beautiful peach done means absolutely delicious you can almost smell them through the screen now on to the last gummy fruit snack is that what you call this root by the foot so we're just going to spread our chamoy mixture onto the snack got me I don't know why I don't know what to call this the candy so we're just going to spread it onto the candy and then we're going to sprinkle on our Tajin and I also of course went overboard and added a bunch of citric acid and I think a little bit too much tajin I found this one was like a little bit salty and like I love salty so it was all good but just a heads up less is more you can always add it after but you can't take it off actually you probably could just take it off by kind of sweeping it off with your fingers but that makes mess and we don't want that and I spoke too soon our last treat is the infused nerd rope so I'm gonna do these one by one because I'm not sure how well the mixture is going to be able to get on it just because of the larger shape that it is and my make sure it's starting to be a little thick and harder to get to evenly distribute so you could also throw it in the microwave for another 10 20 seconds to just kind of make it a little bit liquid here and a little bit easier to spread now we're gonna add in our Tajin and sugar so you guys the chili powder etc I kind of just have a mixture going on the side there and then we're gonna shake it up and then repeat the same process with the other nerds rope and there's our last one excellent they look wonderful I am totally in love with Mexican style candies we don't have a lot of this type of stuff here in Canada so please let me know for something you guys think I should try that I would like if I loved this type of thing which I totally do [Music] it's so good with the spicy on it spicy and three everybody loves spicy and sweet thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much have a great day [Music]", "DxZBva6YLVE": "now we'll use a sport or you could use any other stirring item and we'll just mix this until the corn syrup completely dissolves okay that should be good we'll take this to the awesome stove and pour it into this pot Willy to pouring two packets of unflavored gelatin go ahead and do that and then we'll leave 85 grams of jello for this part you could pretty much use any flavor you want you don't have to follow ours but we'll be using strawberry mmm this is the good stuff now I'll just get our wooden spoon mix this thoroughly until all the powder dissolves still need a stir in a bit more we could still see a few chunks [Music] okay once you get it to look like this you could stop stirring and then turn the stove on to low heat while we wait for that are gummy tray it pretty much feels like one of those rubber ice cube trays this set also comes with this dropper tool but wool actually be using this condom it squeeze bottle it'll be easier and faster to pour into the mold so after about 5 to 10 minutes on low heat your gummy syrup should be ready the texture should look something like this alright so at this point you're ready to pour but you may want to place your mold onto a plate or a cutting board it'll make it easier to transfer into your fridge you don't want to wobble your mold all the way over and accidentally spill it yeah that would be bad now that the gummy molds on the plates we'll pour the liquid into the condiment squeeze bottle it did where parents and sweet jelly hurry some sweetly catchy song right just made it up all right let's put the cap back on and we are ready to pour stir with this one on the bottom left if you guys are using a condom and squeeze bottle to be sure not to squeeze too hard it might overflow you want to just gently squeeze it and if you're using a dropper it might take a little longer but the gummies will still taste the same okay so I'm pretty much doing the same thing over and over again so let's fast-forward to near the end you had a few more left three two and the one whoo we just made fifty gummy bears here's a closer look at her beautifully filled gummy bears ah some of you may be impatient like me putting a lot to leave this in the fridge overnight boo and it's the next day I'm sure you could already tell just by looking at it but the liquids have turned into a gummy texture let's take one out whoa that came out pretty easily and the multi is pretty clean well I'm pretty impressed okay so this gummy bear came out in perfect detail you could see the arms the leg", "O9WSv_-t7Gc": "learn with Eddie hi Eddie Eddie hey what are you looking for need help haha you can't just eat sweets all day Eddie don't you fancy something healthier like fruit for example he don't be like that fruit can also be fun and gummies can be healthy I'll prove it to you we're going to make homemade gummies you'll see how easy it is we just need gelatine and fruit juice we have those right great let's get down to rock and you guys pay close attention and you'll learn how to make your own gummies what flavors would you pick you can tell us in the comments hey Eddie what flavor would you like our gummies to be we have many options in the fridge Oh strawberry ha ha ha I need you to pick that flavor we just grabbed some strawberries and put them in the juicer and done well the juice is ready but we're not done yet we still have to heat up the juice in fact since we're already at it let's make them in two flavors like some to be orange flavored I bet they're really yummy too as I was saying we have to heat up the juice and then add a few spoons of sugar but not too many ok Eddie a couple of each will do ha ha ha don't worry fruit already contains sugar when it's hot and thoroughly mixed we add gelatine it's a powder we have to add to the juice so that it has the consistency of a gummy when it cools down oh that's right I haven't told you we have to wait for them to cool down before we can eat them hahaha be patient Eddie it will only be a couple of hours here and check out the phone shapes no half when the Jews and yellow team are thoroughly mixed we pour the mix into a mold it can be any type of baking molds or even an ice cube knowledge the more origin of the shapes the better put it in the fridge to cool down on Harden and now we wait well done Eddie I'm very proud of you you were able to wait huh Eddie the gummies are ready ha ha ha yes yes just a sec tell me what do you think delicious hi how are the birthday party preparations coming along ha ha yes it's a lot of stuff isn't it well I told you I help you eh hey let's see last time we made invitations so today we have to make the cake you haven't even made it and you already

Eddie's Party here we go what flavor would you like for your cake Eddie yes Eddie I know you love chocolate but we've already made a chocolate cake before remember oh I have an idea do you remember that rainbow cake with ruins hey what do you say we bring it to life ha ha I knew you liked the idea that's why I brought it you sir we can set it to cream mode and here we have the sponge cake layers for making the birthday cake layers ha ha let's see Eddie for example the first layer is red so we could use strawberries for instance we put them in juicer and done now we have a red layer see it's very easy if it come on think of a fruit for the orange layer of course Eddie the orange that one was easy wasn't it although a mango or peach would have worked - come on Eddie the next color is yellow a banana perfect Eddie you know your fruit really well a lemon or pineapple would have also worked this is coming a long way Eddie come on let's do green next and Eddie apples are green on the outside but not on the inside we need a fruit that is bring on the inside a Kiwi yes that will do now there are only two left Eddie next is the color blue I know finding a blue fruit is rather hard what do you say we use BlackBerry's if we are blackberry Queen okay it will turn dark blue sea it doesn't look half bad come on the only one left now is the color purple well done Eddie grapes will be I feel [Music] and now we have all of the colors of the rainbow but what kind of icing should we go for maybe one that looks like sky or like clouds oh but of course Eddie cream cheese this way it will be wide just like clouds perfect oh but wait we forgetting the most important part happy they LD then we did it daddy we have a rainbow K well that's one more thing we can cross off the list next

had a guest and tonight's the night we have a guest and he has one of the premier barbecuing channels on youtube and you're like why are you bringing a barbecue guy on we have a plan i'd like to bring up my buddy greg from ballistic barbecue greg how you doing good man how are you doing i'm so glad that you could join me here oh yeah it's been a blast and so can we tell them what we're doing i think you have to tell them to explain why a barbecue guy is on your channel yeah i think you're probably your guy's a sexy shirt greg reached out to me and had ideas about helping boost the breezeway cocktail hour show and i was like well you have a zillion how many subscribers you uh like 340 350 something like that i don't know 300 something you entered some change lots so he was like i'd love to help you out and i was like i would love some help out so i i was like what there that doesn't make a whole lot of sense about doing barbecue with teak oh wait there does we found out a way trader vic not only put out a couple of incredible bartender's guides but he also wrote what's it called trader vic's tiki party yeah he had that one and then i think he also had a guide to food and drink and a couple other things there are some ribs that trader vic had in his recipe book menu yeah recipe [Music] and and so greg's going to be cooking those i thought we would do one of the oldest trader vic cocktails and then do the whole thing together let's do it so let's do it so the cocktail that we're gonna do shows up in the menu as trader vic's own punch it says fresh fruit find jamaican rum with a flip philip with a phillip of almond so i don't know what a phillip is but there is uh or jot in the drink so that must be what they're talking about when i went to research the cocktail i found it in trader vic's bartender's guide from 1972 and then i went deeper and it showed up in a little bit of a different version in the 1947 version we're gonna do the 1972 version because it's a little bit more refined so for this cocktail we will be using lemons oranges rock candy syrup or jot syrup hamilton white stash it's like a light puerto rican rum and greg brought me this incredible gift appleton 21 was it 21 years 21. that's a lot of years it's old enough to drink that's a dumb joke this is an incredible rum so thank you again for the kids welcome and let's drink it this is where i get hung up in some of trader vic's recipes i'll i'll make the drink and then in the description of how to make the drink uh he says some bizarre stuff like don't actually measure anything just squeeze it into the glass and you're like that goes against everything i've learned about tiki cocktails for this one he says what we're going to do is we're going to squeeze orange juice over some shaved ice then we're going to drop the shell in the glass then we're going to squeeze in lemon juice drop a shell on the glass so that's what we're gonna do we need a half an ounce of each of those so let's start with a lemon you know that you want me to get a real knife we're gonna use this little cheeser like what kind of knife this is like the night for the breezeway show what do you have i have a japanese shun yep you mind yeah i just like this is kind of the yeah i mean i you know i've always thought that the ceramic one was good enough no you need one of these but you know i may have to have to hook you up with one of these oh really yeah oh you got the connection oh wow that looks like something you'd fillet a fish with well this i mean i'll be honest with you this is a boning knife but so not usually meant for for cutting fruit but it will cut through little cup fruit i'm not giving him crap about his little knife i'm not i mean i i respect your knife but i i just like the way you're holding it delicately since you're making me do the cutting i'd rather use a tool that i'm familiar with how's that i think that makes sense okay because we don't want bloodshed right are you ready yeah half yeah yeah i guess that'll do it right tool for the right job see we have a couple of glasses here i have a trader vic's brand glass here and i have spikes breezeway cocktail hourglass i just ordered more of these so more of them are on the way but i'm going to give this to you once we're done so appreciate it certainly half an ounce of lemon juice and i have good eyesight except when it comes to things that are close so he's gonna hook me up with his eyes yeah all right you ready that's good right there glad you were here bro okay so it says that you're gonna pour that over ice in the glass so that's the way we're gonna do it we're gonna do they said half a scoop of ice and since we're using kind of a small scooper we'll do it like this this will go into mine can you get another half ounce out of that lemon i think i can make sure you totally keep going keep going keep going yeah right there is perfect now we're going to drop the empty shell in there i had to ask him what a shell was i was thinking like pecan shells or something yeah do i put it in there no well i it says it to to put the empty shell in the glass so we only have one and two drinks you want to cut this in half doesn't it feel like that's too much shell to put in it seems like it's ridiculous in my opinion but i'm not trader vic i'm not trader vic either it says squeeze the orange juice over half a scoop of shaved ice in a double old fashioned glass drop the shell in the glass this is a double old-fashioned double yeah it is okay squeeze in lemon juice drop in the shell so you heard him look can we cut it in half i can that's again i yeah that's a lot of women yeah use your uh super knife yeah so we'll put that in each glass that is just bizarre it is that's a lot of shell and then let's do the orange and we'll do the same thing we're going to cut this guy in half and we are going to do half an ounce in each cocktail and that is very efficient yes i'm telling you we'll get one for uh not nearly as adorable as mine though it's not you want to squeeze that you could probably hand squeeze that okay half an ounce yeah i'll let you know [Music] that's good right there and then we will pour that into here all right that's great right there okay another half an ounce right there why don't we cut that thing in half and then i guess we're gonna drop the shell into the glass and if you people out in internet land think that this is ridiculous and we're doing something wrong let me know but literally that's what it says in the bartender's guide okay it's a punch trader vic's own punch it calls for a dash and i want to make sure the dash is so when trader vixx talks about a dash that is not bitters he actually means a precise amount like a half of an ounce or order of an ounce quarter of an ounce so for the next ingredient we're going to do a dash of rock candy syrup and a dash of orja so let's start with the rock candy syrup rock candy syrup of course is three to one sugar to water so you can squeeze a little bit harder there who is it that's good right there who sing the song rock candy is it ufo was it i don't know another song yeah all right quarter ounce is that good yeah that's good right there quarter ounce of rock candy syrup in each glass okay now the urjot and of course is like an almond liqueur i know super good smells almond this one's from our friends at bg reynolds delicious delicious or jean thank you bg reynolds a quarter ounce go ahead that's good right there perfect okay quarter ounce here one more that's good right there perfect that's really perfect okay so we're getting the ingredients here now on to the fun stuff the rum we're gonna do one ounce of light rum yes yes and then one ounce of dark yes yeah tell me i think i see the one but i'm gonna go off of you okay a little more i'll keep going so you can use a hamilton white stash for this also i love bacardi eight for uh the light rum i'm looking no a little more a little more sorry i know it's nerve-wracking when you're like i don't know okay perfect no one's going to complain too much about an overpower anyway no not at all and now for the appleton 21 i'm sealed oh wow this should be a sponsored one by appleton look at how fancy come on appleton yeah appleton this is a cool bottle yeah super cool bottle and what is that a cork cork oh that smells good smells really good yeah it smells smooth what else keep going keep going keep going keep going there we go one ounce there [Music] that's perfect right there great okay so there's the drink now i would imagine that if they were making this at the bar at the restaurant bar or whatever they would make it like this and then they would move the contents into yeah i was going to ask you is it shaken or stewart or anything yeah it it is shaken most trader vic's cocktails are shaking and the most done the beachcomber cocktails are actually mixed with like a gotcha mixer i'm gonna put another scoop of ice into this i'm going to pour the contents into the shaker and i guess i'm going to shake them with the fruit in here too yeah i can smell the fruit yeah it smells good smells really good and then of course you want to shake horizontally look it won't work until the tin is nice and frosty and a quick little tap there goes whoa there it is nice wow okay looks nice kind of a peach color yeah let me put some ice into the tin and then you can do the same it seems like one scoop gets you close you ever done this before we've done it without but with two tins oh okay i've never done it with a glass okay now i'm gonna shake until the tin gets it's already frosty it's already done yeah baby there we go oh come on show off you made the fruit disappear oh there it goes have you ever been drinking with an iced like iced tea or something and all the ice comes into your face of course yeah it's pretty comical okay so we are going to uh top them off with ice of course that is super fancy ice from sonic and then we're gonna garnish with a fruit stick and a little dude and a fruit stick and a little dude of course that's the menehune that we learned about a couple episodes back and then a whole bunch of mint here's your mint you know what to do with that see professional do i just jam it in there or what do you do jam it in there like this oh i mean sorry manahuni [Music] all right and so from pre-1947 this is trader vic's own punch looks good totally does i think i did a good job with the mitt too yeah super good job cheers cheers interesting yeah it's good yeah very light it's very light i was expecting a little bit more kind of a medicinal punch you know what i mean yeah yeah you almost don't taste the alcohol you know that it's back there but it's it's a light cocktail there's kind of more orange than lemon i would say the thing i'm really loving it though is you're getting just so much in your face i mean you're smelling all this stuff yeah and that that's the intention for the mint it's awesome is it when you bring it up to your mouth the mint goes into your nose not digging on the two star little mini straws i'm telling you that what you don't like a little straws i'd rather have one decent sized straw oh you mean one from surf side sips a glass straw yes in fact i don't know i'm just being real with you though what i don't like these two stories you don't like the little straws no i don't that's what cocktails have i know but i'm it's gonna i'm gonna blow a gasket here yeah that but the great the great thing about this drink is it has these big pieces of fruit in it like a punch would you know if you had a big punch bowl it's got the mint that when you bring it up to your mouth you're smelling the mint you are you're you're gazing into the eyes of the little hawaiian what's his name again dude menehune manahuni yeah so the ribs should be done just about now yes so i'll tell you what let me grab my camera stuff so i'll have something to put on my channel yeah and then we can try it out okay cool we're going to do a simulcast does that work yeah let's do that all right so we have spent the last four plus hours creating an original trader vic's meal right right we did that for hours it was from trader vic's tiki party trader vic's tiki party he's looking down and smiling right now yeah i think probably laughing at the knife i think he'd be stoked at our two-person tiki party that we're having two persons and a dog yeah well can we try them let's do it brother all right which uh can i have whatever one you want okay that's the end one yeah is that good yeah i mean it will be a little bit crispier right here on the edge oh wow mhm this is good mm-hmm really good let's see what i mean though the ends always a little crispier the sauce i i think just has like a the spice to it it's really nice the sesame seeds and it just it has a that was the great thing about tiki is it's not only polynesian but it's also asian and parts of african it was an amalgamation of exotic cultures but that brings me back to dining at trader vic's in beverly hills it brings me back to dining at trader vic's in london never been there what london or trader vic's paul been to grass skirt in san diego yeah so how did you get into tiki my wife was into it a lot earlier than me i still have food in my mouth i'm sorry right now um i've always liked tikis and and the polynesian kind of works of art you know uh figures and such but um it's a it's her she she got me intro i mean she drugged me to a couple events and a couple tiki bars and i just really had a blast yeah you know it's funny i've always had worn hawaiian shirts of course when i was in junior high you know i had tiki shirts well southern california yeah it's so light it really is so like light and refreshing it's getting better now that they're that it's getting a little bit more watered down yeah and that's part of tiki drinks is like the the water really helps it's like an old passion right yeah water is part of the ingredients and that's why if you use you know not good tasting water it'll affect the taste of your old fashioned just like but it's it's actually easier to drink now too with these stupid straws so when did you start your channel your youtube channel oh i shot my first video september 2009 okay but i wasn't real serious about it at that point i i honestly thought that first video was going to be my last i just i mean i just shot it on a whim i know what you mean yeah now i'm trapped trapped forever doing these videos you get hooked and that's what happened to me i started uh from that one video i started noticing interaction from all over the world yeah and again this is a long time ago and youtube was still fairly new yeah and yeah it just became an addiction well i think my favorite thing about youtube is just like the the relationships and the friendships you end up well that's the best part of it it really is and and not only from viewers but also from people who want to collaborate and uh you know i don't think we would have ever met if had we not done this thing and and it was a it was a super fun afternoon yeah it really made it out we did have a good time well it was four plus hours like yeah it takes a long time to make these things happen yes it does got to meet your dog astro yep you know it was uh yeah it was good and you're right youtube's brought me many blessings my household many blessings but i always say this the best blessings have been this sounds so corny but the legitimate friends i've met over the years yeah um not just not just fellow creators but but also some of the my viewers you know become friends with and yeah i mean like really really good friends yeah yeah it's cool it is really cool and i've got friends people that i call friends all over i mean all over the world now yeah where where i mean there would have been no chance of meeting any of these people it's just really wacky sometimes i cannot believe it's real yeah well yeah i mean it doesn't seem like it should be a thing but if you do a good job on your show what has been your biggest accomplishment well it's brought me a lot of opportunities yeah you were telling me about nashville right yeah i was the official girl master at the 2017 country music television awards yeah and country south socal he was a metal head they didn't know it i snuck through the snook through the cracks yeah and country people know their barbecue yes they do that's in that's incredible so you were flown out to nashville yes paid a bunch to barbecue and that's not a bad deal my yeah my wife went with me and yeah and uh yeah that i've done a couple books that i never thought i mean in a million years i never would have thought i would say you'd write about author yeah i mean really my high school teachers are laughing yeah and then you have a new channel that is specifically for hamburgers right yes and what's that channel called so creative gray ballistic burgers ballistic burgers yes the interesting thing to me is one of the things that you do is you recreate popular hamburgers yes so in and out burgers or it's one of the things what a burger yeah what did you do what do water burp you did do a wooden burger between the two channels i have they're not all copycats i call them copycats yeah but i have probably 153 hamburger videos i've done and um 153 hamburgers yes and and i always do a call for action to hey give me suggestions and i have a list a mile long yeah and the cool thing is again so many of the requests are not just you know you think of america you think of hamburgers yeah but i mean i have requests i've done burgers from amsterdam wow you know great britain which that's kind of obvious but it's italy yeah japan i did i did a burger it was a it was a recreation of a japanese burger king burger and and the bun was jet black the cheese was jet black wow and the sauce was jet black wow that sounds disgusting it was well it was actually good yeah but it had crazy ingredients like i had to make the buns i had to make the cheese wow the american cheese yeah and i was using ingredients like uh cuttlefish ink you know uh-huh oh my god yeah it didn't even look real but it tastes just like a hamburger yeah yeah i'm sure a cool taste but but sometimes like part of food is visual so if you're looking at like a black hamburger a lot of food is visual oh yeah yeah yeah so when you i know that you did a version of an in-n-out burger and in and out happens to be my absolute favorite burger place did it taste like a nut burger yes i mean a homemade burger even though i i love in and out i mean honestly they're great because of just how fresh they are yeah all the ingredients are so fresh but i think any burger homemade is always going to taste have a little bit of an edge oh yeah better than in and out yeah i've uh but but i but i'm not taking away from a minute yeah i did um an old video where i did their animal style okay double double yeah and then i did a just a standard double double it's a newer video and so if we if we watch those videos can we learn how to make them ourselves yes you can oh man we were talking there's a debate about the fries i like them love them yeah yeah the key to the fries is eating them on site yeah you know you don't take them home because they degrade quickly right yeah well um unless you have anything else i think that's i think that'll do i really just want to i really want to shut off the cameras so we can finish this plate ribs because i am they're so good and i'm starving sounds like a plan brother all right let's do it so greg thank you so much for joining us on spike's breezeway cocktail hour thank you for being such a gracious host yeah yeah no problem and uh go go to his channel check out all the stuff subscribe do the things and we'll see you in the next cocktail video cheers he has one of the premier barbecuing channels on the youtube on the youtube i'd like to bring on my buddy greg from gregory or greg greg it's called uh tiki party trader vic tiki party traders yeah trader vic's tiki would say that again there are some ribs that trader vic created god damn it this is the whole thing just hold it like here a little higher literally that's what it says in the in the in the bible let me see i think this is going to be amazing what the drink is drink or the video oh so we're going to do one ounce of rum in each rum we're going to do one ounce of rum here what get out of here oh nice on my dog oh sorry sorry astral of course that's the menehune that we got what's his name yeah okay like camera stuff the best blessings oh my god right in the middle of this heart kills this heartburn hey you're going to be heartfelt again no i can't now no i'm not and now i'm back to my like cow they're spicy too they kind of have like a spice to them i just gave them meat with no sauce oh spam they love spam in hawaii they do world war ii has influenced a lot of this you know that just it's like a byproduct of world war ii the pacific campaign have you done a video with spam think about maybe making spam oh like making it from scratch i've made bologna from scratch oh i know what's he doing is he looking at you he's looking at me he loves me he's wearing this too see he's looking he's like a junkie you've got him hooked now you push her i plan on making a spam video someday okay like i said i've made baloney from scratch jack daniel's confused bologna smoked it's good really it was good this is good brother it's almost right now i know you're you're drinking the hell out of that thing and i'm like i can't get enough of the ribs can you get this at other tiki bars other than trader bix this drink probably not huh it's just i don't think so yeah astro you got to stop barking he's just looking at you like come on man you hooked me up earlier i'm jonesing what's your favorite tiki bar well again i'm so young i mean i'm going to have to say based on the very few places i've been i mean i told you a list of places i've been which is i mean probably what seven i guess tiki bars total um my personal favorite is grass skirt just because it's so immersive yes you know the um and you live really close also to um or what was it a false idol false idol false idol we haven't been there yet yeah we that was again we had plans but things changed in 2020 yeah false idol is absolutely incredible yes again it's really on our list and then we frequent i mean it's not a tiki bar but valley high oh yeah we go there for like oh that's right i mean it's a tiki restaurant you know yeah from uh i think the first war never second war yes i don't work the first yeah but the second war i think they had pamphlets on the uh the tables of the bali high saying that if you see anybody with binoculars looking across at the at the warships yeah to say something yeah the north islands literally right across the bay yeah and back in world war ii well the warships were around the corner and then all the that's the air base the naval air base so yeah they used to have all the sea planes faced there oh okay the seaplane ramps are still there wow i used to before before 911 when it not 911 changed a lot of security protocols there but i used to dive scuba dive underneath the um seaplane ramps for lobsters wow no way crazy lobsters oh really yeah wow you've been to bali high a bunch a bunch of times have you had their drinks oh yeah yeah they're good they're they're no they're good if you're trying to light something on fire or get super yes i'll say super drunk well yeah and the other i'm not an aficionado i'm trying to learn that's why i'm watching so i'm trying both thank you so much i went to that tiki event there oh yeah you said it was like a tiki marketplace or something yeah yeah i don't care what my wife would remember what it's called sure they were selling as a zombie it wasn't a zombie no i mean it was literally you know just a bunch of fruit juice yeah and then three different types of rums yeah and that's that's like what ends up happening with a lot of tiki drinks is they just kind of make up something and they called a zombie or they call it a mai tai and half the time mai tai isn't really a mai tai i had a my tie in catalina island yeah oh wait that at that tiki bar luau larry's or something yes and it was i was damn near hallucinating it was really strong it was probably pineapple juice and myers rum and orange juice and grenadine and this dog if you look at the historical cocktail recipes for the balihi and you make them like the mr bali high they're incredible drinks i've had that drink yeah i've had i've had a lot of them not at the bali high or or made it at home no at the belly high oh yeah they don't make it the right way i know you'd think it was their namesake dude you would think that they would make it that the way they made it for forever and ever but i don't know what happens to these drink programs and and i don't know maybe it's too complicated for them or you just forget yeah they just get set in their ways or whatever but if you can hear my dog right now we keep giving him pieces of red ribs and now he's hooked like a junkie and finish our conversation now he won't bark at us up here okay okay can you stop so we can have a conversation yes he's under the influence of spare ribs i know he's like whatever the hell that is i want more of it so yeah the thing about the bali high is is their drinks are aggressive yeah they are they're high acting yeah yeah high octane for sure but the building is gorgeous the food's great like and and those drinks are great when you're there as long as you don't have more than one or one some cool history there incredible history yeah the bali is it's a survivor it's a survivor i never want to talk poorly on vintage tiki bars restaurants because you never know how long they're going to be around yeah i feel like you know my wife and i we've really missed out on going to some we went to you know we were on a road trip and we swung by to try and hit on the beach camera but it was we just missed it it was a himalayan restaurant but there was still the big swordfish up there it was right it was heartbreaking you know yeah i know what you mean and for a long time oh i don't want to get into this but yeah for a long time there are a lot of people talking down on the beach palmer the sam seafood version and i just kept going you better stop it it's not going to be around forever it's not and it's gone now so we had a we had 10 great years there and uh you know now it's gone so there's more on the chopping block unfortunately yeah i think so too by doing this we're able to time travel and we're able to sit at beverly hills trader vics and uh enjoy some of these incredible ribs and some of these incredible drinks so yeah yeah thank god people wrote this stuff down can i put this dog down now i think he would love that all right i think we're done i think we're done thanks dude thank you brother yeah it's super fun it was really fun yeah are you gonna eat that one no if you want it yeah oh i love them [Applause] thank you for stopping by blessed barbecue and today's video i'm going to be cooking up sugar cured baby back ribs it's off the menu from the legendary trader vic's tiki bar so as you can see i'm not cooking at my house i'm cooking in this tiki layer just about an hour and a half north of where i live and i'm being hosted by my buddy spike from the hula girls channel come on in spike your house thank you yeah thank you so much for having me so spike we're doing a collaboration here he and i are going to cook these ribs together and then spike's going to treat all of us to i don't even know what cocktail you're making trader vic's punch trader mix punch traders we're going to be making trader vic's punch wait where's my book thank you so much for having me on your show at my house which is so weird to come like to my bar as a guest behind the bar it's really weird for me to be here actually because spike has a channel that my wife and i have fallen in love with it actually kind of helped us get through the very being of california you get it the very intense beginning of the lockdown you know we didn't have any place to go and we kind of immersed ourselves in youtube and we found spike's channel and we fell in love with it so thank you for that one of the things that that drew me to this channel to spike's channel is he's obsessed with the history of these drinks and you know he goes over the top finding the correct spirits to use the correct ingredients and a lot of these these cocktails were lost in history and they're just now finally you know being uncovered and i'm the same way when it comes to you know these really iconic historic hamburgers you know i go above and beyond i mean drives my wife crazy trying to replicate these recipes i'm digging it and this is why i'm here and i thought that that's why we were such a good good uh pairing is because i saw you doing the historic hamburgers and stuff and i was like oh man maybe if we could do a trader vic's meeting yes then it would make sense for my channel it makes sense for your channel it makes sense for america or wherever you are anywhere really my half of this collaboration is we're making the sugar cured on the menu it's spare ribs but i'm using baby backs because of the cooker i'm using it they'll fit easier but the sugar cured barbecue ribs i'm running off of the book uh trader vic's tiki party yeah and you're using i mean uh i'm using a barky loud dog so so the interesting thing to me that stands out right away is that already we're using demerara's here ah so the interesting thing to me is that right away i noticed that we're using demerara sugar and demerara sugar pops up a lot in tiki cocktails yes so this is a pretty healthy meal right oh it's very very healthy feels like benihana's you know what that is right ginger yeah you just had some drinks i uh ginger syrup yeah okay yeah did you uh did you like ginger or marianne better actually mary ann those little daisy dukes they really like mary actually where am i calling daisy dicks those pre-daisy dude they're i guess they should be calling them mary ants so let me let me just teach you the maybe the most important fact about trader vic bergeron he is credited with inventing the mai tai in 1944 wow okay that's cool okay wow yeah it smells peanutty yes it completely changes this would not be the sauce this is going to be without that wow so if you are allergic to peanuts can you still sesame seed it's not peanut oh yeah yeah science science this is pepper from vietnam it's a little uh region in vietnam supposedly the world's best pepper really amazon wait can i have some of that pepper that's way that is way more than i needed you said some yeah a little yeah it's just pepper i mean it tastes it's good honestly there's nothing crazy special about it but i've read somewhere he gots pepper i read somewhere it was the best in the world so don't do that [Music] you", "TRYuPHLJNZo": "presenting the one and only fruit-bearing gummy bears amazing fruit made with real fruit juice amazing fruit is so fruity you can hardly bear it tropical flavors too", "cFCRxry7_8E": "[Music] hey guys if you haven't seen my Angry Birds fruit gummies video part 1 well I recommend watching that before you watch this as you'll need to understand that information if when you grasp a hold of this information hey guys welcome back to another Angry Birds merchandised video and today is part two of my let's talk fruit gummies video the year of 2012 saw many new additions to the Angry Birds fruit snacks an entire second series was released when you character boxes and new flavored characters to collect series 2 had 6 character boxes to collect Matilda Stella Hal bubbles BOM and happy expression of red [Music] however 10 packs gave way to 2 additional characters king pig and female red or as the community likes to color ruby the new gummi flavors were watermelon for Hal Peach for Stella orange for bubbles and fruit punch for matilda and red and BOM would return with their cherry and grape flavors in some 10 packs Ruby would actually replace Stella for the peach flavor additionally every 10 pack would come with a 7th gummy it was King pig and he was apple flavored but really it might as well be the rerelease of the minion pig gummy series 2 could be found overall in theater boxes or 10 packs no peg bags and no bulk [Music] along with the second edition gummies for a few holidays during the year special edition seasons gummies were released for Valentine's Day there was a hugs and kisses themed box for Easter there was an Easter eggs box for a Halloween there was a Hamill ween style box and lastly for Christmas there was a wreck the halls themed box these boxes had seasonal detailing that related to their in-game counterparts snow Easter eggs pumpkins hearts etc depending on how you want to look at it sadly the season series continued using the wave 1 style gummies so no special seasons gummies were ever produced but they did make special pack sizes now available were the 24 seasons pack in the 15 seasons pack otherwise these came in theater boxes and 30 packs [Music] speaking of special series a new space series was commissioned in March of 2012 to coincide with the release of Angry Birds Space unfortunately this way suffers the same fate as the seasons wave no special gummies were ever produced they simply z' the waveone releases there was four boxes to collect overall super space bread fire bomb laser chuck and the space bubble pig once again these either came in theater boxes peg bags or ten packs [Music] it wouldn't go without mentioning that healthy food brands also released a Star Wars series man they almost got the entire classic saga and gummy form of course besides Rio the Star Wars series had special intergalactic detailing and design done its packaging and there was five different boxes to collect Luke Skywalker Princess Leia Darth Vader Han Solo with Chewbacca and c-3po with r2d2 so clearly they wanted to keep the amount of character boxes down but also have a good selection of flavors thus they doubled up characters on the boxes not only that but they also doubled up on one of the gummies that being r2d2 and c3po shared a flavor so unlike the aforementioned they did create new gummi molds for this series and the characters didn't exactly correlate with the flavors Luke was cherry Leia was strawberry han was Apple Chewie was raspberry they doubled up on c-3po and r2d2 which was lemon and Earth was great I've never understood why they assigned certain artificial flavors to certain characters in this set I can understand Luke and Darth but I don't understand Han and Chewie it just seems like healthy food brands was trying too hard to keep the same flavors as waveone but also fit them in with the characters that they had here interestingly a 20-pack of Star Wars gummies was offered as well other than that you could buy them in ten packs Peg bags six packs and of course a theater boxes that was some part too huh Thank You Birds gummi flavor may be gone for good but that doesn't mean we can't look back on a great product also if you hadn't noticed healthy food brands phased out the bulk boxes I'm assuming they didn't sell very well so they stuck with what did sell the theater boxes and the PACS for the most part oh yeah and if you can find an image of the female red 10-pack let me know down in the comment section below please before this ends one last thing a lot of people wanted me to talk about Fraser the other Angry Birds fruit gummy manufacture well they're a completely different company that does things in a completely different way so they deserve their owning your birds merchandise video I review certain companies not certain products but that's gonna do it for today's video guys come back next time for another ring weaver his merchandise video because we do a ton of on my channel like and subscribe for more awesome Angry Birds content leave a comment down below sling whatever that you want and I'll see you guys next time", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "z4DvXP1HGE8": "what is up guys welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be making like gummies they're very easy to make and they're super delicious let's get started guys so today we're going to be using oh and by the way the main rule for these gummies is we're going to be using like um fruit juice it has to be clear which means no fruit pulps or anything has to be clear or the gummies won't look like gummies so i said i i'm gonna be making like two diff separate like colors and like flavors so for this one i've got some pomegranate juice and some gelatin and sugar i've also got some clear apple juice and the exact same thing gelatin and sugar and i've got some lemon juice um i'm gonna halve it for each each of the juices guys so i wanted to do my pomegranate one for my my pomegranate juice first i put in my pomegranate pomegranate juice my gelatin my sugar and half of the lemon um juice now i'm gonna put it on the fire all right guys so i put my like gel like i guess you can call it juice on the um on low fire you've got to keep mixing it until everything dissolves but you don't want it to bubble to start bubbling so yeah as you can see not everything has dissolved yet so i gotta keep on mixing guys my um liquid have got warm and now i'm going to pour it through the silver into the measuring cup because then like you see it has this little thing so it'll be easier to pour in and do be careful the mixture is hot and i'm doing this because like there might be some gelatin lumps in there which we might which we don't want perfect i've got a board here because we're gonna like carry this into the fridge and like i can't just carry like this real spill first i'm using the santa ones because close to christmas am right oh i'll take those ones too dinosaurs why not so guys they're gonna they're gonna like be like so you don't want to feel it over feel it because we're gonna have to carry into the fridge later on these are gonna be some they're gonna be really good i assure you so i i still have some leftover i'm gonna pour it into the dinosaurs let's make the they just let's make these ones and then i'll make my apple gummies guys so i want them to be clear so i don't want these like bubbles floating on the top so i'm going to use a napkin and gently press it down so then the bubbles go away magic am i right placing it down all right guys so i i made like the full santa and one and one row of dinosaurs so i'm gonna um put them in the fridge and i'm gonna do the exact same steps with the apple juice though see you then all right guys my apple uh my apple jelly is ready as you see like now you don't have to go to the shops and buy them you can just like make them yourself and will cost them less i think these will taste much better than than the school ones so i'm pouring in finishing off the dinosaur molds hi guys so i'm gonna need another mold i'll bring out this love heart one these love heart ones and look so i'm not sure how they'll do this but i bet they'll be real good like i can't wait to taste them i just want them to freeze already so then i can taste them guys so i'm going to blot them again with a napkin so then the bubbles will go away so i just thought maybe this would be a bit quicker if i did this yes it was indeed quicker yes it worked it actually worked all right i'm just gonna blot these hearts off and then we'll send them into the fridge for a few hours so see you then so they look amazing see they're not falling out in any way and um i'm going gonna take them out with clean hands oh look at this look at that so easy and like making this was actually like like really fun like making like all the flavors and you don't have to use the flavors that i used you can you can use like i don't know like any fruit um juice you want just you have to make it like clear without like any fruit things in there so like orange juice wouldn't really work in this in this situation they look amazing guys so guys like i've been excited this whole video i was like are they gonna work are they gonna work well they worked out amazingly i kept them in the fridge for about two hours i would say and i expected them to not be ready but well that was expected so you gotta really like push from that there you go guys look at how shiny this is like oh my god these are even better than in the shops these these gummies are particularly like more better because you can make them like any flavor you want but i would say these are perfect stretchy i should probably take them out now instead of like eating them so i'm gonna take out the dinosaurs and the hearts i can't stop myself hey guys i just realized the softer the molds the better they come out like i've got some extinct dinosaurs here more fossils than dinosaurs look at this because the the molds they were a bit harder like pushed through and the santas they came out clean because the mold was softer and see what i meant by clear juice look look at how clear that is i can see through it now we're gonna taste the apple ones yes that is better than the pomegranate ones these gummies are fine dude i love them um guys they're not as sweet as you'd find them in in like the stores or something but they're still so good but anyway guys if you like this

How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

probably twice as many products that will carry anticipation is growing for the day edibles hit the shelves you get a lot of people especially asking for gummies and that's a really popular one so I

fears of overconsumption he'd have suspended dion Waiters that may have been what happened to dion Waiters on thursday multiple reports say he had a panic attack and needed medical attention after ingesting a THC infused edible sports media can't confirm exactly what he took how much or even if it caused his attack dry mouth rapid heart rate palpitations I think I'm feeling like I'm gonna die no you hear me fine this ER doctor says he often sees patients suffering from anxiety after taking too many edibles often what happens with people ingest one they don't feel any response they ingest another and another and then a couple of hours later it feels weird and more weird than you would expect in people's reaction as a panic attack the other problem he says is that the THC may not be equally distributed you get the side of the brownie tray that's got more of the THC and the other person gets some that's less you know it depends on the concentrations how many milligrams you want Travis Peterson prepares cannabis infused food he says it comes down to proper technique a lot of these stories we hear these brownies and that were made in people's kitchens where they don't really know what they're doing they're just putting the cannabis in there you know they're not properly emulsifying that butter into the batter of that the higher the better he says not everyone knows what their tolerance level is which is why consumers are advised to take dosage limits seriously and pace themselves start low go slow or else what is supposed to be an enjoyable experience system may be

Instagram and YouTube so I want it to make them and see how they turned out so of course I turn to Amazon to get some silicone molds I ordered bears and then I ordered snakes because I know Hannah like snakes and I like bears so it's a perfect job all right so ingredient-wise let me show you what you're going to need you're gonna need sugar-free jell-o you get the Walmart brand or Target brand whatever brand you want I just happen to have the jello brand and then you're gonna want some plain unflavored jello or gelatin actually and this is the Knox brand I got this at Walmart you're gonna need one packet of the unflavored jello for every box of jell-o you use and I forgot to say this is the point three zero ounce box the four cups the dogs are wound up so we're going to deal with it and then for each box of pudding and unflavored you're gonna need a third of so I'm gonna get this started over here I'm doing two boxes today just because I'm not sure how much I won't have to fill up my mold so you're gonna want to get a little saucepan out and put on your stove and put it on medium heat and then you're gonna add your two packets of your flavored jello and your two packets of unflavored gelatin [Music] and then I'm adding 2/3 cup of water here 1/3 of cup for each package of jello and then you're going to let this warm up and you're going to want to stir everything in here until it is dissolved [Music] okay so it looks like all my jello and gelatin has dissolved in here and I don't really want to bring it up to a boil because you know when it starts boiling jello starts to get frothy and I don't want it to be frothy for when I put it into the molds so I'm gonna pull this off the stove and then we'll get filling our mold up okay so I recruited some help here Hannah's gonna fill the snakes I'm gonna fill the Bears up and we're gonna see how this goes [Music] hi guys so we finished up filling our molds I got like one and a little over a half of a gummy bear mold and hand I got maybe a little over a half of the gummy worm mold filled up so we definitely need more jello or fill our two molds up but that's okay I have the Mod baking sheets which I place the molds on before we start filling them up so it would be easy to put them in the fridge since Silicon trees are pretty floppy so we are gonna go stick these out in the fridge and check on them in a couple hours all right guys probably about an hour to oh I kind of lost track of time I've been longer that has gone by and our jello gummies have set up so I'm gonna get ready to pop them out of try here all right so all right just flip it over and pop them out like this and as you see they just pop her it out you probably get through that thank you so here's one of Hannah's worms they popped out really nicely there you go and I'm gonna get popping like gummi bears out here alright guys so there are my gummy bears let's do a close-up they are so tasty they really do taste really good it's not exactly like a gummy bear but it's pretty darn good see and they look like real gummy bears too so I give this recipe totally to thumbs up also it's quick it's simple and it tastes really good and it's just sugar free jello which is basically no points and barely any calories alright guys I hope you enjoyed that video if you did please give me a thumbs up if you haven't already please subscribe to our

gotta [ __ ] later but you'll be fine i [ __ ] pissed myself [Music] you", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "H0azVjvwgLA": "hey world's greatest review channel here look at this it's a little gummy bear from a pack of harebo gummy bears i like it don't forget to like share and subscribe and leave a comment about an item you'd like me to review next", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

leave me a comment thumbs up on the video if you like it and if you want to see the keto gummy recipe this please stay tuned [Music] okay guys back with the recipe for keto gummies I have all of my stuff right here I'm going to read you the recipe I'm going to show you what I have and then we'll get on with it so basically the recipe says one small box of sugar-free jell-o one packet of gelatin powder and 1/4 cup of water okay and so I'm going to show you exactly what I have here ignore the washer in the background if you hear it I'm going to make four different kinds of gummies of gummy bears and whatever I can but I'm going to show you what time I have I have a these are all kroger brand no they're not all kroger brand okay I have a Kroger sugar-free raspberry okay so we'll have raspberry gummies I have a Kroger sugar-free orange orange gummies I have a jello brand sugar-free lemon and I have a kroger brand sugar-free strawberry oh I have five cards actually I may omit one I'm not sure important make four different cons I like different colors so I may take out this strawberry and then I have kroger brand sugar-free line so I'll probably do a lime a lemon orange and I think I'll do strawberry and I'll take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito

popped up people from fishing fights at the dispensary the other day and I'm trying out a few other products try them out bring a review for you cuz she punches they sell paper risers they sell disposable vapes and they also sell cannabis and food gummies and CBD products I don't happen to have any CBD products on hand today but I do have the other products so the first one start off is the cannabis infused gummies it's California so right now they change it up in our gummies and everything these have a unique little safety feature chopper would you do chatterbox but you basically just fold it in and it pops right up once you fall the size and little safety feature in your box come out like that they also offer disposable rates which is something new to me they've been out but something into me I've tested it for about a week or so so you talk about that and then they also have a cartridges one gram vent cartridges first thing I will start off with saying is good products I like the product there how quality products a lot better than some of the other ones I've seen their cartridges or VAP cartridges they actually have a metal tip for metal with glass which I was surprised of a lot of them are just plastic with some little plastic tip on the disposable cartridge just have a ceramic tip and a battery and I've been using this thing and it is powerful I'll just pop this one out we'll start with this so here go there vaporizing this one is particular in particular is our granddaddy purple indica but they come in a bunch of different varieties flavors you know how to grow the information on the back paws didn't take a look let's just start yourself cuz I I was interested in he's because I've never had nothing like this before I'm used to the ones that you load up as it normal like a little right here with legs but this one is different this one is basically you use it and get rid of it but they made it pretty high-quality this is ceramic has a ceramic together glass that's the battery and therefore the gums the gummies look like this any strong all the products are between 80 and 90 percent THC then they build big class and you see I've been enjoying these gummies and then come in a 10 milligram measurements that they all individual two milligrams I wish they would have been a little more separated but that's not a big problem I just bite it off [Music] these they actually portion of proceeds from this special edition product will be donated to military charities talking rock with that but there are southern california-based company and the products are really good I really enjoyed the product and this is they've a cartridge real high quality I noticed that very clean too very clean taste and very good taste straight metal I like this style of tip they put on here a lot different than all other ones other ones you basically get something either like this style or well this is very innovative to me this definitely gives them a

is powered by the loud pack group so shout out to loud pack vegan gluten free uses distillate sour fruchu we're gonna do a one bite review i'm gonna talk to you guys about it here we go here we go oh man i'm excited [Music] this one's being tough to get out it's the last one i let i told my lady it says save so you can eat the other ones but i need you to save me one for the final review and it's tough right now to get to so what we're gonna do is just rip this open a little more there we go all right all right so she's the sticky one we've got a nice chewy gummy here it tastes to me like the sour patch kids the watermelon candies this is exactly what it tastes like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this product is almost a perfect product you know no gelatin made with pectin it does say distillate on it i think this is a 9.75 for me out of 10.", "dEBwlj6KCDM": "so I'm always looking for more ways to get collagen into my diet every day and what a great way to accomplish that is through just simple gummies on this episode I'm gonna show you how easy it is to make some delicious blueberry gummies whoa [Music] [Music] okay so blueberry gummies this is going to be so ridiculously easy and simple then it's almost gonna shock you blink we're gonna be done but anyway what we're going to be using is Lakewood pure blueberry organic no added sugar just straight blueberry juice this is my favorite supplier of beef gelatin this is by with proteins what we're gonna do is I'm gonna pour one cup just one cup okay shake it up just a little bit one cup okay to 6 tablespoons of beef gentlemen now what's so important why is beef gelatin so healthy this is predominantly collagen and you're gonna start seeing a theme that I try to get collagen in my diet is often as possible why because it's the most abundant protein in the human body and we're talking about the memory that's being responsible for skin hair nails all the connective tissues with carla tendons ligaments at collagen so as I poured this in here I'm gonna stir this up okay I don't know if you can get in there and see that it's starting to come Joe already and that's okay that's when we tell her what you happen then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let this sit for three minutes so and three minutes I'll be back it has been three minutes so as you can see what it does is kind of look solid right but you still see it's kind of grainy in there so what we're gonna do is we're now gonna keep this stuff okay let me get this going medium to high heat we're gonna do this until it actually starts to melt and it gets hot we don't really want to boil but we want to do we do want to get this hot so add this sitting here and it loosens up a little bit and starts to melt I'm gonna start stirring this stuff to get it ready to actually put it inside the mold so you know the cool thing about this not only is it super nutritious but this is a project that you can actually involve the whole family especially kids this is actually kind of fun so well we later on go into where I'm actually putting the concoction inside the mold you'll see that where you know some kids will actually probably enjoy this and then we'll do the taste test to reveal all that good stuff and these things are actually phenomenal um you don't have to just use blueberry juice you literally can use them with any type of juice you want I've made all kinds of gummies before and some later episodes i'ma be doing some very very cool gummies probably gummies that you've never really combination never even thought about but like for instance a good combination with collagen so remember the most important ingredient in the beef gelatin is collagen vitamin C and collagen go together very well so you can make a gummy that involves you know a good organic orange juice and gelatin those are a phenomenal gummy but this is all about blueberries today so now it's starting to loosen up a little bit so I'm gonna start stirring it and if you can get in here you can kind of see it's melting right so I'm gonna completely melt this start to stir it and like I said we don't want to boil we just want to get nice and hot okay and now it's completely melted okay see some smoke coarse obscene coming out of there so that lets me know it's pretty warm etat I'm gonna give it just another 30 seconds of salt that's good all right now the next part the final part almost upon the part the final part would be a kneading action but the second-to-last part is gonna be actually getting this bad boy into the mold so I will see you in two point two seconds again now it's the fun part the wriggle fun part so I got my son he's back again this is Tristan if you missed the first episode and then the second episode so now we're gonna do is when you decide drop it right here okay word of advice for whatever reason don't turn these up after you pull up the actual solution because if you do for some reason they projectile explode all over the place Flynn at the hard way a couple times right so what I'm doing right now is gonna suck this up alright come on over and we're just gonna start filming off each one of these so even some of the younger kids I think would actually enjoy this after the process of making some good fantastic snacks and then even educate them along the way collagen is very very very important for kids because they're constantly growing and like I mentioned earlier collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body a good way to keep your skin healthy your nails healthy your hair healthy your joints healthy is with collagen in your diet every day I can't stress that enough having 400 all right and now what we're gonna do is put these bad boys in refrigerator takes about 60 minutes for these babbling stick and gel and then I will see you on the other side the taste test and see if these things actually are delicious be back shortly so it's been approximately 60 minutes I just pulled these bad boys out of refrigerator son are you ready yeah you ready yeah you ready yeah all right so what you do is grab the tray and then it's real simple all you do is just pop these out okay oh isn't that cute thank you all right but now do they taste cute Cheers no scared me for a minute man all right so a delicious way to get collagen in every day if you really want to you can't let your own companies um the next thing that I want to talk about like I don't have any sugar to this okay so and I usually don't add sugar too many things but if you wanted it to sweeten it up a little bit get some organic turbinado sugar organic cane sugar even use honey if you want to just a little bit sweeter but if your being conscious about losing fat losing weight you might not want to add that for sugar these taste fantastic just the way they are but anyway so let's recap this final proteins beef gelatin you can take your favorite juice I actually use to feel good live good you know some Lakewood pure blueberry organic juice like I said if you want to get a little extra bump in vitamin C vitamin C and collagen work synergistically together you can use orange juice in collagen it's very simple use about one cup of juice to about six tablespoons and voila you know all within about an hour and what probably ten minutes of prep time you have delicious snacks that the even the kids can enjoy these are young men and young women growing up they need more healthy options and collagen remember is the most abundant protein in the human body so we need this new connective tissue suitable skin you see what does for my hair you know me alright so like always help me help you and let's just get healthier one day at a time", "3j2v1S3jr7s": "hello everybody welcome back welcome back to cook miss so I apologize if I look like death I'm just getting over since food poisoning so bear with me welcome to the second video today and this is the second video that is new Earth's New Year's Eve inspired so these are some champagne gummy bears and I thought this would be so much fun they do taste alcoholic so if you're too young to drink alcohol or don't like alcohol I wouldn't recommend making me but if you want something that will give you I don't think they'll get you drunk but they're really cute addition to any New Year's Eve party or any Christmas party and they have some gold leaf in them so this is edible gold leaf kind of expensive but if you want to go all out for something special for Christmas or New Year's this is like the cutest treat and it's so fun of putting the gold leaf in the gummy bear containers I don't know why

trying so hard not to swear I can feel it release it oh my god sorry for nothing we're good", "w4dOiiEDVP4": "Hello and welcome to Savoury Days kitchen today we're gonna make gumdrops or gummy candies this recipe is a really simple one it only requires gelatin, water and sugar and its texture is really close to the famous gummy bears from Haribo which is gummy, chewy and sticky another very nice thing of these homemade gumdrops is that we can make a lot of different flavors of these gumdrops or go for a healthy version of gumdrops by using fruit juice instead of water so in the next minutes, I'm gonna show you how to make gumdrops with gelatin sheets then with gelatin powder and fruit juice and in the end of the video there will be some tips and notes for you to make perfect gumdrops at home first add gelatin and cold water into a bowl and leave it there for about 15 minutes or until the gelatin is completely softened note that the water should not be warm because it will harm the gelatin while waiting for the gelatin to get soft add sugar and hot water into a sauce pan and bring to a boil on high heat and stir to help the sugar dissolve when the water starts to boil reduce the heat to lowest and let it simmer for about 15 minutes after about 15 minutes when the gelatin has already  turned soft we add all of the gelatin, including the water... that we used to soften the gelatin into the sugar syrup in the pan stir very well to help gelatin dissolve and combine with the sugar syrup let it cook for another 2 - 3 minutes then turn off the heat we now have a very nice and thick candy syrup what we're gonna do next is to quickly pour the syrup into the mold for the molds, you can use whichever tools that you have at hand like a baking tray, silicon chocolate or ice-cube molds or just a normal box is also fine next we're gonna add some drops of flavors and colors into the sugar syrup and mix very well don't skip this part because it gives taste to our gumdrops and for me this is actually the most interesting part to do because I can create as many variations of gumdrops as I'd like repeat with the rest of the candy syrup and when finish, skim of the bubbles on the surface... of the sugar syrup if there are any let these gumdrops cool down and put them into the fridge leave them there for at least 4 hours until the gumdrops have become very very firm to take the gumdrops out, first dip the knife into hot water then run this knife around the edge of the mold to take the gumdrops out the gumdrops will be very sticky so we need hot water to cut them more easily if you have edible cake spray, you can spray the mold.. before adding the gumdrops, it helps as well and the last thing to do is to cut these gumdrops into small pieces using a sharp knife if you'd like, you can roll them over granulated sugar like this and after coating them with the sugar leave them stay at room temperature for 1 - 2 days for the sugar to crystalize which means that the sugar turns harder and stick to the gumdrops creating a thin layer of sugar outside the gumdrops so that was with the gelatin sheets now I'm gonna show you a quick example on making gumdrops with gelatin powder and orange juice the method is actually the same just substitute the gelatin sheet with gelatin powder then add the water with the same amount and stir very well to help the gelatin softened and for the sugar syrup, we use orange juice instead of water but feel free to change it to another kind of juice to your taste we bring it to a boil then simmer for about 10 - 15 minutes then add the gelatin that has already been softened and stir well until the gelatin has dissolved completely and lastly, pour the liquid into the mold let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours for the gumdrops to get completely firm then take the gumdrops out as you can see, the advantage of a silicon mold is that we can take the gumdrops out really easily so in this last minute, I'd like to share with you some tips and notes on making perfect gumdrops at home first, the amount of sugar can vary depending on your taste if you don't want to coat your gumdrops with sugar you may want to increase the amount of sugar (in the recipe) by 10-20% for a little bit of sourness in the gumdrops add lemon juice into the syrup while you are simmering it or adding some vitamin C is also fine third, the longer we simmer the syrup the firmer, harder and more gummy the gumdrops will be this means that you can adjust the gumminess of your gumdrops for example if you don't want your gumdrops to be too gummy or too hard then you can shorten the simmering time and vice versa fourth, the gumdrops should be very dry when coated with sugar otherwise the sugar will get lumpy like the gumdrops on the right hand side of the screen these gumdrops should be stored in air tight bags.. or boxes in a cool and dry place and they can be used in several weeks thank you very much for watching this tutorial and have a lot of fun with making gumdrops at home we see each other again in other videos of Savoury Days Kitchen Goodbye!", "JDbazWjashQ": "[Music] but mr. gummy princess toy review hybrids and princesses it's a team I bet the president's missus fans today we are back with another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of today's video maybe like more signs experiments give you a big thumbs up and subscribe bye remember this is fine",

me quick fast and was like you got to take that down yeah because i think i mean it was a great idea because it was like days six years just [ __ ] say you're about to die but i'll say this about david cult leaders don't die is a great fun and he worked it at the very end that he was like dead silent i thought the video was just gonna end and he's just like cult leaders don't [ __ ] die from covet that's a [ __ ] way to go out go leader don't die there's a t-shirt it's gonna take the [ __ ] national guard to get me out of here all right buy the dip if you want [ __ ] i don't care i'm not going anywhere you think this is gonna [ __ ] take me out i got [ __ ] covered right where i [ __ ] want it i'm lying down it thinks i'm going out i'm [ __ ] got it in a reverse chokehold partying the [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not like his corona buyers i think he's just being an [ __ ] i think he's being a 45 year old trying to be a 21 year old like he always is and it's eventually gonna catch up with him [Applause] [Music] i once in traffic in florida had a couple there was a black couple they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my face and now i have like [ __ ] milk cake and up my [ __ ] hair just to try and counteract this disgusting like i can usually handle almost everything that vivs has

world's hottest gummy bear the gummy bears was the worst one and this was our first episode back in a very long time and i don't know if people will do next week's episode like we're going to think of something very easy like i'm honestly thinking about doing a sunday bar and giving them like a stuffed animal just for a week just to make it easy on them because they won't come back to the bar if we keep doing the gummy bear that's how bad it was [ __ ] like my stomach is just in a [ __ ] knot right now so just ate that [ __ ] thing vibs after i ate it he was like just you know if you have heart problems you shouldn't have eaten that if you get heartburn you shouldn't have eaten that and also it's really gonna [ __ ] up your stomach for the rest of the day and i was like would have been good

for you i mean i feel like i feel absolutely awful there's in the episode there's er no in the deleted scenes there's one point where kfc is like oh well vivs is doing it with me so it can't be that bad and i was like no it's that bad i'm just doing it because i want you to do it for the camera i'm drowning i really will i mean you can't do this anymore hot we're not doing hot anymore yeah do it

ice is worth it i think i'm gonna have ketchup goodness my issue isn't like my mouth isn't spicy my issue is my body is rejected [Laughter] i [ __ ] pissed myself [Music] [Laughter] full control of

gonna throw up no you're fine it's easy dude i come back to this office and it's like i go back into vip's torture chamber it's [ __ ] crazy someone asked me if i look for like certain people like

to be an italian could not handle hot it if you're italian and you're watching that kind of embarrassing probably it's that [ __ ] bad how bad though like like undoable it hurts to breathe do you have

back of my throat hit the back oh i just hate that thing that dangle in the back of the throat yeah yeah that's why you play the game though spewing moments like that when it was happening i thought

corp has a very diverse portfolio of investments ranging from ufc licensed gyms car dealerships as well as real estate what factors do you look for when you're investing in assets and what is the common denominator between all of them what the what that was a real question great question i feel like i'm on cnbc yeah great question really yeah i like it i like it um first of all we like three things we like things that we understand really well we like things that we can bring more than just capital and things that we're really really passionate about like presidente would be a great one um and then we like great people to manage these businesses so like in baseball we like playmakers in business we like playmakers all right any other oh jake do you have anything you want to say

fine dale ever hear about it broadcasting yeah favorite announcer of all time mike tarika and what do you feel about michael k i grew up the yankee fan like big hat mentioned so i've grown to love him um i could see how some people have an issue with him having a talk show and offering maybe too many opinions as a play-by-play guy on the call but i like him and jack buck i mean joe buck love joe buck okay what's your question so on that note as a analyst what are you looking for as a play-by-play guy to make your job easiest ah great question i i think we're looking for just first of all chemistry uh in someone who is selfless that wants to put you in a position to win it's like anything else in sports what made magic johnson so great i mean he will just pass the ball and you would dunk it he'd put you in a position to win um i think that's what uh joe buck or matt vasquez does so well kevin burkhardt thanks man that was fantastic awesome that was fun really good question great

s stool stream stadium we're trying to develop some new games figure out new things we can get into the app marvel racing you know people always talk about it they always you know tweet us like do marble racing do marble racing uh so we decided to try it obviously you just have to build it yourself so and the interns around here do nothing except for sit in the gaming cave all day and talk [ __ ] so i was like billy i i was like billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i i didn't mean to do i was like i don't know what you're talking about she's like you've been have you been talking to me in the controlling for the last half an hour i was like i literally just walked in the door and then billy had like his little smirk on his face like yeah we've kind of been telling them just like that you were in the in the control room the whole time billy's a menace he's an absolute menace uh he has no supervision he's just gonna who knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles you know so you're actually serious you guys are standing like like we're not gonna do the real one jake we also wanted to test the integrity of this and also the camera like where's ashton kutcher like i feel like actually it's gonna come out yeah i'm so sorry we thought that was fake what do you mean when we kept laughing like you were saying that i was being [ __ ] annoying you", "itjKYWD-H50": "as i made this chamois and gummy bears it's so good", "SLdFyYKzxiU": "hello everybody welcome to my channel I'm going to go icicle and today I'm presenting you with something but I had bought like sometime back and just arrived today and that's a gummy bear Clint yes I said gummy bear cleanse it's a seven day gummy bear cleanse that you do for seven days here's a little vial and underneath this has the days and there's gummy bears in there of course haven't tried them yet because like I said I got them today but it's by just wonderful luxury candy boutique sugarfina and they also wrote a personal note said enjoy the sweets Seraphina but um I was going to read all of this but if you rather go ahead and know more about it I put all the information in the description because it's really a lot for me to say and this is like the fact that they have what really surprised me was that when the package arrived I was expecting a small little package like this but it was this big giant box it's so much wrapping around it and I only get why they wrapped it in such a big box it's so it wouldn't get destroyed on the way here which is very amazing because nobody or no company ever thinks about really doing their items or inventory or whatever they're going to send out to a customer really good you know those other companies that have broken glass or not in a bubble wrap or paper and everything gets moved around well not this is not the case it was wrapped several times and it was perfect I was a bit worried that they would not get here in one piece and it would be melted because here in Texas everything melts but to my surprise it it arrived perfectly so I'm I'm really highly recommending this company they have they have like gourmet gummies and other candies like the champagne gummy bears made with Dom Perignon vintage champagne and I just thought I'd give this a try because I thought it was interesting and it was really good and I was worried that okay well maybe this might not taste good because it says that the Bears are made with apple lemon ginger and greens no official colors or flavors fat-free and non-gmo the gummy bears which is amazing it says do you know and they have a little fact here did you know sugarfina first announced green juice gummy bears as an April Fool's prank in 2016 when customers started calling in to purchase they teamed up with press Juicery to create the real thing and I try to order it before they went really fast so I ended up being on the waiting list and as soon as they were available I jumped right to it and these are the small little gummy baby bears and they have once just purchase on its own you don't have to buy all seven days but I was looking for a way to get healthy but also have my veggies and I don't like the way a smoothie taste so I'm giving this a try you guys let's see how it tastes really good and yummy oh man and it smells so good so yes I highly recommend sugarfina company they did such a fantastic job I would love to do business with them again there's such a great company and everything that they have there I want to get but I can't afford some of it and some of it well I shouldn't really eat my tight pennies so thank you for tuning in I hope you enjoyed this video give them a look-see and I hope to see you in the next video stay I see bye", "6tjwNDYi9Lg": "hey guys it's Mariah and today I'll be showing you how to make your own gummy candy or fruit snacks at home this is a super simple two ingredient recipe which you can make for your kids for their lunchboxes for parties anything really it's super healthy or natural and can be vegan so I'm gonna show you how to make it you will need 1 cup of fresh fruit juice and a squeezed store-bought it's really your choice also three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or if you're vegan agar agar or Vegeta which is a plant-based gelatin these are optional you can use honey as a natural sweetener your juices sour or vitamin C or citric acid for a sour kick and ulead silicone molds or ice cube trays or anything to form shapes for your gummies let's get started so before I start I want to show you the molds I'll be using these emoji molds look super cute but the thing is they have small indents which won't go very well with our gummies so if you're using a mold like mine try skipping it and using a mold with deeper indents like this animal one because deeper and then said to show more also these hearts are super elegant for maybe parties or something but yeah this is the juice I'll be using it's strawberry juice which also happens to be vegan although you can make your own so you know that it's super healthy and here's my gelatin powder again you can use agar agar powder or flakes or Videl I'm going to start by measuring out a cup of my fruit juice I'm pouring that into my saucepan but before I put that on stove I'm going to sprinkle in three tablespoons of gelatin if you prefer your gummies to be harder like the store-bought ones go ahead and add another tablespoon mine turned out quite a jelly-like almost so go ahead and add another tablespoon so you just want to let that sit for around three to five minutes until most of it has sunken in and after it has done that we are going to transfer it to our stove on low to medium heat and mix it up until all the gels and crystals have been dissolved into our liquid and you end up with sort of a syrupy looking consistency also make sure that it is warm and not boiling as you can see we have some bubbles going on so you can either skim off the top with a spoon or you can pour them in your moans and skim them off which is actually easier if you pour them in share molds and give them off but more time consuming so you choose then I'm going to transfer my silicone molds onto this tray for easier transportation now all you have to do is pour in your warm syrup you don't need to let it cool otherwise it might sit so just pour it in it's not going to damage your molds you and once you pour that in put those bad boys straight into the fridge for around 45 minutes to an hour then they're ready to be popped out we have smaller molds like the emoji ones I'm using be careful with those because they will break and you can make like cute little intricate plating design like I did with the hearts we can package them or do whatever you want and give them to your friends or family make sure you store them in the fridge because it is gelatin and it can melt in the hot room and as you can see the emoji ones do have some small designs and they show when I reflect them in light but the deeper indents like these animal ones are so much better Wendy I hope you guys enjoy this video I hope you found it helpful if you did have that like button subscribe and tell me what is your favorite gummy flavor thank you so much bye guys", "eCgLs3IYk0E": "[Music] and fries today I got my big mouth oh okay this is what a Big Mac looks like check it out it's not big enough we don't want the Big Mac fries look at them they're tiny I know I know go down master like when you guys know I need my good luck for my gummy videos let's try and a 200,000 thumbs up you've been killing it lately so I know let's get started so today I'm back with not only myself I know I'm the dummy god but I don't just Beth combine the camera so obviously we're gonna need some gelatin okay guys and you guys know I go hard on the gelatin so I got some gelatin bro are you serious am i serious about what - hey sugar flavor what it's a boy stuff this is possibly gonna be the biggest DIY I've ever done so basically you know I would explain everything I got but I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing so we're gonna figure out what we're doing as we go through the video basically what is in a Big Mac is there's bun meat lettuce pickles okay I'm not doing pickles but we got cheese more button more meat and fries so I got this mode for the top of the bun this mold for the bottom of the bun I got wolves for cheese I got wolves for tomato because you know you can't miss out on the tomato on a [ __ ] burger okay Big Mac I need to add tomatoes your burger you don't even like tomatoes I don't like tomato but everyone likes Tomatoes except for me I [ __ ] hate to me but I'd love to me exactly the Big Mac these Tomatoes we got molds for the patties we got moves for more patty we got molds for the middle one and we got normal for the lettuce and last but not least I got some primal picked up every [ __ ] morning all right this better be enough if not I'm really gonna be disappointed okay I don't want like in the story but you guys know how to make gelatin I don't know how to do it cuz I failed all my gelatin DIYs but Dustin knows how to make it so first step is to warm up what's first up water water big pot Brown cupboard that covers that cover right here okay I definitely lived in this house for a long time another one so everyone knows I'm the king of measuring on my channel obviously I always like to measure my stuff we're gonna measure half of a quarter of a Richter scale okay following along you're not I mean you gotta clean this bird but Richter scale measured me all you man circle shape and that's I'm pretty sure that just equals out to one of those folds now you need the hexagon oval oval shape and then just do it so let's fill it up guys and obviously you know what I'm filling it out there's this way you can do it but there's also this way so what I like to do is sometimes have a little fun with my camera mom just come in are you serious okay so we got one but it'd be the same technique with the second row this sprays too much mom come here for a second I need you to walk under this you don't want to come here so what you're boiling water guys it's a common misconception everybody think mom does wrong it off put it to medium-high and then to the little guys because we'd like to be productive on my channel in the meantime we are gonna be making this McDonald's fry box and my mom's actually gonna be making it I bought some [ __ ] marker to do the shading so mom when you can't make something yourself guys you got to get your arts and crafts mom basically if you want to make anything into the magic shape anybody watch Wizards of Waverly Place cuz I [ __ ] did I love that show okay I don't know if you guys know but Justin Bieber got his instagram back so you're gonna be like Justin Bieber got a finger back touch it in a [ __ ] turn into a fry box let's do this you do it I don't know what I'm doing recipe right yeah you gotta commit to it we'll do it together three two one Justin Bieber guts fry box just like that there's nothing over here you need to worry about nothing over my dad look we're gonna do the end on this box I know it looks better with an Emmy my mom drew this and that's definitely not this do the comparison this looks like Whoopi and this looks like a Ryan's reason not to mention it might not fit on the box guys the box is so blessed so let's go through the GI Bill I bet Raghu lon Eli beeline so as you guys can see the pot is steaming hot right now we're gonna put half the band in each pot like so and it's already starting to solidify oh we're supposed to whisk it this is the small way where's the biz Rick it's not apologetic you can never have too much gelatin I don't know if your science teacher told you otherwise they were wrong wolf he's always right [Music] now that the gelatin is a bit warm we're gonna put the sugar into so we're gonna use half of it in this one this is enough to give you instant diabetes so what is high laid everything out on the table guys we are gonna have to fill all of that up with do you like be alive heal I'm feeling the rest of the gelatin is going in this one and you have to whisk it right away otherwise it will get higher the amount of gelatin I got could feed six hundred families you know throw the bacon and we're gonna pour it into each of the mold so we're gonna start with the buttons tell me that doesn't smell yeah [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] okay we got the top button now the bottom button so now that the top and bottom funds are good we're gonna grab the middle one oh my god that's uncontrollable it's leaking every why is the price old brown so when you [ __ ] up guys don't worry we're recovering I did that on purpose guys I'm gonna teach you guys what happens when you [ __ ] up we're gonna pour this into this well just a nice yellow fry like so there we go so while that gelatin is cooking I'm just gonna add some food coloring in each thing fries need to be extra yellow so I'm putting a lot of yellow food coloring just to make sure they stay golden yellow crispy McDonald's fries you know how they are I also got a little bit of icing coloring but this stuff is super saturated super concentrated you don't want to use too much of this otherwise it'll turn oh I forgot to tell you about that your stained that's it no no no 100% staying for a week oh my god my fingers are now tinted yellow forever it's gonna put a little bit of that something okay guys we got the brown icing sugar I'm not saying my finger Brown I don't want you did you [ __ ] him wave your eyes it does not clean it we got to be very careful with the brown guys oh I said I'm talking about okay got my strawberry flavoring we're just gonna be flavoring the patty strawberries super strong yeah it's super strong okay so you use it all right tuberous Robbie said to crush me oh it's all gone okay so for the button we're gonna do a little bit of pure lemon extract apparently it's not sour I don't believe it that's heat units our boat holy [ __ ] that's bad next one we're preparing the lettuce the tomatoes and the cheese we're going to need our pan dusting can you take the top off for me please I like that nice and oily there can never be too much oil there as if you actually made that we're gonna be making the lettuce you want the legs to be nice and crinkly oh that's a good idea where he's pulling it through the door how is he still pulling it so like I was saying guys we're just gonna need about this bigger piece for this okay we need this lettuce shape number one BAM that's that romaine right there that's that good [ __ ] she's a little bit of orange oh that's nice that's what I'm talking well that's that expensive cheddar cheese that you get from the gums actually dogs are not about expensive stuff quality it's quality you know it's part to be pleased so for the tomatoes we have red food coloring and red icing color we're gonna use the food coloring because we don't want it to be too red three dots of that should be good enough those are nice tomatoes those are really nice no you would not so basically now all we have to do is leave all these to cool down for like the next eight to ten hours but I'm just gonna leave them overnight for a full day so I can make sure they solidified and I will be back when they freeze tomorrow all right guys day two we are back everything should be gummy let's go to the washroom and check it out as you can see you guys I told I'm gonna put a sign do not enter a gummy inside so that's how you know shit's important yeah so here's what we got it smells [ __ ] absolutely delicious actually let's see how one thing is that's [ __ ] gummy it doesn't even look fully gummy but that is way more successful than I thought so now what we're gonna do is bring everything out to the table and make the DIY biggest gummy burger McDonald's Big Mac burger in existence I don't want any of you guys telling me I'm not the goat I'm the DIY gummy goo right and I got check this out this is like some thin plastic looking material the buns are nice tomato and ketchup are nice we're gonna start with the fried okay so Dustin's working on taking out the fries we're gonna take them out and then put them on a cutting board and cut them after that's the way it's gonna go they just can't break on us if they break up this it's about to [ __ ] swing down and smoke you in the head yeah anyways like I say hopefully they don't break on us please gummy just come out in one piece I need everyone to smash that like button right now if one thing breaks then basically were [ __ ] so give me all the good luck guys I'm not good with gummies you know I fail all the time let's plop this over and see what this bad boy is saying three two one no nothing it's not coming out this is not good right now oh it's coming it's coming it's coming when you just suction it's gonna break let's go look at these McDonald's fries just finishing up on the fries guys we hold the knife so it is just gliding in like butter this fry is a little broken by the neck but we're gonna try and MacGyver a way to fix this but at least these fries are flawless so in order to get the fries to stand up we need to have a backing behind them otherwise they're just gonna snap off so we're gonna use wrist the board that I got but the thing about this is I wrap the tape around it thinking it was a good like life hack but it's now stuck I pull it and my mom gets pulled with it we're pulling the wrong way we got it off okay so now we are starting with the bird the first thing we need is the bottom of the bun three two one oh let's go okay so the next thing on a Big Mac if we look at this cheese we're gonna put on some cheese nice lay it on so that it hangs off the front oh my gosh delicious next is the Patty three two one oh yeah look at this concentration guys it needs a magic Wolfie top that is a patty if I've ever seen one that looks beautiful the cheese on the front of patty god damn what is next on this boiler oh yeah dehydrated drop cake okay we gotta be strategic with how we place these now we need to go a little bit to the left because it's tilting a bit to the right more cheese align it with the other cheese some lettuce because you know diet Wolfie is still alive and well so here we go let's go let us look at that so I'm over here too even though the weight will do Tomatoes next quick little yay whoa Oh tomato god this is just getting more unstable by the second yeah yeah I'm really scared we are limited on time all that's under the patty we have another yeah but the Patty's supposed to go under the tomato you have a Big Mac right there how did you yeah the party goes on top really patty goes on top confirm that it's the last thing the hell is Hattie bun Big Macs also don't have tomatoes do they don't but my Big Macs I've tomato this cannot breathe hi this is it too many I say we go over there right a bit there's a good balance drop panicky the ketchup does not want to move ketchup done three two one will expand kick the table world [Music] yes we're just taking the thumbnail but the burger is starting to crack my mom is behind me and trip me it's all good take the fries away this is way behind the scenes overthrown there looks like behind you the fries in front of the price where the burgers don't panic you're good you're good 100% you can you see my mom my right arm is numb I'm taking that time now bro it looks beautiful though it looks good it looks great Oh still looking great all covered so guys check it out basically we have the fries these are definitely hard to like just keep up we have to put some support sticks inside each fry just to make sure they stand up but compared to regular McDonald's fries and the burger I mean there's not much else to say compared to a regular Big Mac anyways we're just gonna get a nice cut through the door any other nice burger I feel like once we start cutting it's okay it's not sharp enough you got a machete guys be very careful okay yeah good I'll give you a fried first yeah here's your fries I need to have a McDonald's try to compare it pretty good cuz I wanted I don't want to eat too much down there yeah it looks good oh my god it's not bad yeah take a slice people are you doing that's been said you would take a slicer boom got some nice slices I've ever seen one that's all you need neat ketchup you need tomato can't stands on me if you got a compare so that's a Big Mac those for real good the badge real quick it's all good right Barry actually what it's just so good oh my god so the white bunnies like 2d fruity then we put that in that that was actually blessed this one this one this one this one and I see this one this one and this one and

took\nthe world by storm with his invention\nof the gummy bear. These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear.

guys requested that I make a cute back-to-school treat so we're gonna be making something from my new cookbook look what we're making fruit gummies they are so cute look how cute these are I'm gonna be using our little nerdy nummies mold but you can use whatever silicone mold you have at home that you find and you think it's so cute and you want to make it into a little fruit snack they're gonna make some fruit gummies today let's get started okay so Lindsey you've been on the show before we bake together before yes we made some treats we made a cake and a little tart but have you ever made gummies like candy before no this is a first for me and they look delicious so let's get thinking and look also how simple this is I was gonna say that what the ingredients here yeah now this is for three different flavors you could just do one if you want to like if you have a favorite gummy flavor hmm do that one I can do just watch out the like like these are the examples you've given but could I do like a grape if I love grape yes you can do any make gosh yes you could do grape fruit juice but we're using grape juice orange juice and it's strawberry puree that's what I'm excited about so I'll be putting all of these ingredients and their measurements down below so if you want to follow along go ahead it's down there for you but for the grape juice we've got the gelatin and maple syrup for the orange juice gelatin and maple syrup but then for the strawberry gelatin and a little bit of honey a little extra sweet yeah and we just make them each one at a time and then we fill them into this cute little mold and again is whatever mold you want I'm just using the nerdy nummies one because it's so adorable and I thought how perfect for back-to-school has a little smart cookie yeah oh my gosh I do a little smart cookie so hard yeah a little bit hard a little dinosaur Stegosaurus all the cool things in school this mold right here is from the road baking mine and if you're interested in it I'll put a link down below and what's cool is they have these little squeezes yeah Oh new step ones a little bit of prep Lindsey hold this cute little Bowl okay and then you want to spray it because these are very detailed designs and you want to stick he want him to pop out easily all right just just move it over there I don't want to get you too bad oh geez here we go here oh oh put the tape on this okay that's done and now Lindsey which one do you want to make first which flavor I'm kind of feeling the strawberry puree okay all right so I'm gonna hand this over to you okay and a medium sized saucepan so we're gonna add the three ingredients pour it okay yep everything oh it smells so good it'll delicious smells like just pure strawberries fresh movie though it it smell is this literally just a blended up strawberry or pureed strawberry yeah that's it that's amazing okay and a little bit of gelatin shake that in there shake shake deep deep deep deep DDP and honey it's a little oh my gosh that looks so good I can't strawberry and honey I can freeze that and just do a popsicle right now we could oh no no now your next cookbook I like to stay focused ro okay okay cool so di Lindsey I'm gonna have you do this it's super easy just whisk together those three ingredients together get everything mixed in get all blended and then we're just gonna let it sit for five minutes to bloom once it's blue we're gonna take that little pot and head over to the stove I could tell that you like your advancer cuz you're like you have such good posture and you look so pretty when you're doing it I'm like it's like a little little lady I was imagining pictures cauldrons call me witches but I'll take your magical [Laughter] okay my arms getting tired I need to get on your leg at work okay I'm good good we'll let it sit let it use this this little muscle right that's how bakers are so buff I mean really though we've already got the arms as Baker's right yeah we need the core in the squat so sometimes I like to do these when something's microwaving or baking because it really helped my arms are getting a little strong from all that whisking and also I have to carry around cookie all the time like your cute little dog Luna I can tell her with my finger is cookie she's 25 pounds right now so Lunas six pounds so that's a big difference like cookies like a you-know-who bowling balls I remember when we were at Justine's birthday and we were like standing around holding hot dogs just talking and I wanted to feel like a part of the group right so I pick up cookie this huge double bowling ball after a while like am i starting to lean back just like oh oh thanks Mike see this is what I looked like at the party oh yeah same girl I mean the other day so we're I mean at all okay clean clean she just don't kiss it it really wants to kiss your face and you didn't let her I'm sorry about it all right it's been sitting for five minutes and it is only bloomed look at that it's thickened it's a little firmer now we're gonna take this over to the stove on a medium heat and we're gonna let it simmer for just a couple minutes and then we bring it right back here okay do it girl okay it's like Oh medium we hurry iris yeah here I'll go oh as it starts to warm up it it gets all liquid me again just whisk a couple minutes then we take it back over here we take the little dropper and put it in the mold done all right we just took this off the stove be careful it's really hot and we're taking these little teardrop urse which come with it and you just you suck up a little bit and then put it in the mold I love the way this smells by the way isn't this so cute so we just oh yeah it doesn't have to be perfect and you're just gonna keep doing this fill up the whole tray and once it's full we're gonna pop these in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour and while it's chilling we're gonna make another flavor okay here we go okay here we go in Oh a G in the fridge so while those fruit gummies are chilling in the fridge this is perfect we're gonna make two more flavors and I want to eat these like now yeah this is perfect so we can make two at a time we can do these together so I gave you the grape if that's okay Fanta I've got the orange the orange juice so pour in your grape juice and I'm gonna pour in the orange juice to a pot a little bit of gelatin or the gelatin first is it important to put the gelatin in first you can put it in second but I like to put it in first so it starts reacting right away so we don't have to wait as long for it to glue and then remember for these recipes I'm using maple syrup instead of honey this is just a sweet knit some nice natural sweetener I always like cooking with whenever I can honey or maple syrup I love that about your recipes actually they've been getting more and more like that over time and even you know if you're vegan and you don't want to use a gelatin they have a lot of gelatin replacements oh nice you could customize it you can make it for you all right let's mix these up and let them sit for five minutes I feel like this is a mix challenge I know who can with faster let me get my posture [Laughter] all the squats farther go home I just learned that the farther out you put your knees like the war at burns okay let us sit for five minutes five minutes to recover okay whoo litter bloom and let her burn bloom man a bloomin bird only a witch would have this and she's trying to block it with her body you show nymphal back your apples you found me out why do all those out there like big dip in the big boys oh man they're like okay now do the same thing is before I get your low-tier droppers and just plop them in the bowl oh yeah this is a little more liquidy this makes me want to drink a huge glass of orange juice right now it smells so good oh dear Oh Wendy you're so fast well I just had an accident but you know it's nice about this dropper accidents are very easily fixable yes yeah yes you can just flick it off or once they're done setting you just peel it so don't even worry about spilling you could use a little spoon I just like the dropper as they make a lot easier but you could use a spoon okay well no rush but I'm gonna play with your pup so Q are you adorable girl what a beautiful color like she actually is like blue yeah she's like this beautiful like blue-gray color and she's got these funny Sharky want some I know it kind of reminds me of like a Rottweiler oh my gosh Lindsey how did you beat me you really did such a good job motivation to play with the puppy is like I got a hurry you think I'm moving I'm gonna go so fast that I love her you're just also I think that's what makes you such a good you know baker and so inventive is the fact that that's your process fact that you're very meticulous you're very detail-oriented it's so and it's good it's slow it's good and that's why your cookbook is amazing I know everything you do amazing cuz you don't speed through it alright lanzhi let's put these in the fridge okay oh then we'll pop them out oh look at you look at you here I'll come help you not let me go the dog okay the gummies have chilled we've popped a few out here's what they look like look at they hold the shape so perfectly you can see all the little details and they're really easy to get out because this is a silicone mold and not a hard old like a like a metal one the metal ones are harder because you can't do this the silicone ones you just push them and boom look at that I have one Rhino I want to eat a dinosaur mmm I really want to try a strawberry one me too I think the puree one is gonna have the strongest flavor all of these gummies are a fruit gummy so the flavours are light and very natural but if you would like them to taste more like a candy like the gummies you see at the store like the gummy bears you add a little measurement of citric acid it's so good it makes it a little bit more tart and tastes more like a gummy bear so it's really up to you especially for kids whatever one you'd like you can't go wrong tada here are they delicious little fruit gummies that we've made today the recipe is in my new cookbook and I'll be putting a link down below and all the ingredients have you'd like to follow along a big thank you to you guys for suggesting

what happens if you deviate the giant gummy bear for seven days as you can see I have one pound gummy bear here or 624 grams it's obviously the way dehydrator works and basically get the water out of the products I don't know how much water this gummy bear has but I thought it will be interesting to just put it in refrigerator and see what happens [Applause] there you go it's huge this Wow that's pretty big and it very soft you can see I can easily bend it like this I'm trying not to build it too much so I cannot break it it said very cherry flavored gummy bears so I'm gonna try it first pretty good then I just wear it like this here I'm going to turn it on at the highest temperature here a 164 in hate is the highest temperature here and I'm gonna put it for I think it's 23 hours the highest so I'm gonna say it's gonna turn off in 24 hours so each day I'm going to be turning it back on for 7 days [Music] all right it's been exactly seven days let's put this coming beer out and see what happens oh it's kind of warm sharing this table I'm actually quite surprised to what happened to this gummy bear it takes about eight hours in dehydrator to make a jerky but this one was in there for like seven days and look is a little bit hot in me check this out it's completely stuck oh man look at this so it's hard to even get it out from all the sides look it up the upper part is kind of hard but inside whoa oh wow let's see if I can cut it yeah that's not easy to do and cut uh-huh look at that Oh check this out oh now I'm like stuck I'm all covered in a gummy beer yeah check this out oh look at that it's very gooey you know it's like a glue well I'm gonna try it again really good we stuck to the teeth your son uh-huh okay oh yeah now got stuck I can't get up alright yeah so instead of actually being dry out completely it became this super glue looking one and like I said it's like look at it I I'm stuck I can't even oh okay okay so I'm trying to release my hand somehow okay fine I'm just gonna be like this it's okay it's just became totally like groovy and right now like if you look at this you cannot even tell what is it it was a gummy bear but actually you cannot even tell it was a bear because right now is just a big mass of blue and that's actually we just drawn if I'm just gonna put my hands like this oh no it's stuck over there check this out I don't know if I'll be able to get it out maybe it's not a good idea actually ah check this out that is hot I'm still trying to get my hand out of this all right there you go almost well don't try this at home guys look what happens well I don't know how I'm gonna get this out later but it's not gonna be easy this is just crazy you know look at my hands well anyways that's what happens when you put the giant gummy bear in the dehydrator for seven days well I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't try this at home stay safe and I'll see you next time [Music] now is a bad bad idea", "3ec_gYDrfpI": "hey guys welcome back to Facebook your kitchen and remain Quito listen so today we're going to make something kind of fun and energetic for sure we're gonna make some energy gummies okay so um I do have a website spirit looks like with energy gummies using vivia drink energy drink which is of course a little bit healthier but I'm going to use today the main energy drink and this one has 300 milligrams of caffeine in it so you'll really get bang for your buck I guess you could say and they're not going to expensive at all and a lot of people and killed have been using these faint energy drinks my husband using on occasion and he's doing overnight but other than that they're pretty good they have super lips in them and vitamin C b12 in here so pretty decent not the best thing but you know when you need that energy kid go for it so each can has about two cups of liquid in it so what I did was I pour that inside the small pot and I'm making it nice and heated up okay so I haven't on medium high I'm gonna turn it down a little bit cuz it's starting to bubble up then I took unflavored gelatin now I got this at my local store up over so if you have a Smith's or you can get it anywhere this one comes with for 1/4 out packages so what I found to get a good texture I use one whole box which is for the packages and one more package out of another box which you arm comes up to about 1/4 cup okay the unsleep now the sweet gelatin now you can use on sweetened or sugar-free gels and I'm sure but I like this texture on this one so what you're going to do is once you heat up the energy dream of choice and if you have a energy you like someone who have a little coloring in them some of them jump okay this one is pretty much clear this flavor is cherry blade lemony all right guys so what I'm going to do is turned on the liquid and what I what you're going to do is whisk it in really really well so you risking your unflavored gelatin and okay it may pop up some because it's on the mg grade so this keep on whisking it really good because you don't want your gelatin to get all hung okay we're gonna let that with in the whiskey on the occasion let it cook for about one minute alright so this is nice and clear and all the gelatin has dissolved well so what we're going to do since it's chewy and lemony and there's no coloring in this one I want to try a little a couple drops of food grade edible food coloring so what what about let's see but three drops in there oh yeah that's pretty so now that looks more like the cherry lemonade really pretty guys go keep like look at that so cute it looks pretty it looks like cherry lemonade just for a little bit of eye appeal guys alright okay now we're going to warm it to our mold okay so we're going to pour it into the mold slowly to see if this works and you get about 24 if you have a different shape in wall that's fun too but put a nice and even and you can always go back in and fill the other cavities up if needed can be sure guys when you do this to completely dissolve the gelatin because you want it like you know when you make jelly or sorry not jelly but when you make um jello okay so now I'm going to pop these in the fridge it should take about an hour or two just like when you make jelly I should take a hour to even longer if you want to be really solidify so we're going to do that and let me show you what our bang energy drink um is alright guys so I'm back in the energy gummies have been a motive now mind you can use any move that you like to make a small gummies like gummy bears I don't have a gummy bear mole and I need to get one but you can make a gummy bear moles which is really fun to take with you you could take these to the movies guys cuz they're really sturdy look and when I was unloading in the earlier some duopoly and one pops off the counter because it's alright so about the-- look at that window but it's just like a gummy and it can be outside the fridge ready to so you can carry with you in a little bag so I'm really do want to bite brilliant now depending on what type of energy drink you use guys it'll be sweeter or Leslie this one has like the perfect amount of sweet but if you have an energy drink that it's not a sweet guys you can just add a few drops of liquid stevia into them in the pop when you're cooking it and then it'll taste whatever flavor or whatever sweetness that you want okay guys but I think they look amazing especially with the few drops of that food coloring in it so definitely give this one a try guys and use any energy drink you like a healthier one or wallet more clean them if you want guys but either way it's gonna be delicious so I will talk to you guys soon and if like this video definitely give the thumbs up and subscribe to the channel guys if you want to see more videos like this and ring the bell so you don't miss out on any time I upload a new video so I'm Rosemarie with faithful killer kitchen I love you guys god bless you and have an amazing week bye guys", "c7Z6ZSQZhz0": "Here's a fun recipe for grapefruit gummy\nbears from chef Jon min-ji's at Le Cuvier winery in California. This is\nserved as a pairing for one of the Le Cuvier wines but it has no alcohol in it;\nit's great for kids, it's great for anyone who likes gummy bears or\ngrapefruit juice. The recipe is very easy; start by putting about 120 milliliters,\nabout half a cup, of grapefruit juice into a bowl. Take about 22 grams, or about\n3/4 ounce, unflavored gelatin and sprinkle it on top of the juice. While\nthe gelatin is softening you're going to take about 177 milliliters, or another\n3/4 cup, of juice and put it into a small saucepan, and 59 milliliters, or\nthat's 1/4 cup of sugar, to the juice in the pan and you're going to heat that\nuntil the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot mixture from the pan over the\ngelatin in the bowl and mix it up until it's very smooth. If you like, you can\nwhisk it to get rid of any small lumps of gelatin but then you're going to want\nto let it sit so that the bubbles subside before you pour out the mixture\ninto the mold. Gummy molds are not hard to find; I bought this one online, you can\nget them in department stores, housewares stores, and they come in different sizes.\nThis is actually considered a jumbo size, gummy bear although they really are pretty small, only about an inch in length. Since the mold is very flexible, it's a\ngood idea to put it on something solid so when you put it in the refrigerator\nit doesn't bend and make a mess. Take the grapefruit mixture and pour it\ninto a pitcher, and then use the pitcher to fill the mold. When you're pouring the\nliquid in you don't have to fill each little cavity individually, you can just\npour it in and then spread it with a spatula, an offset spatula is helpful.\nNow these will firm even if left at room temperature, but if you refrigerate them\nit will happen a lot faster. These are chilled, but they're not going\nto melt at room temperature. They're really fun and they taste good!\nThanks for joining me for One Minute Maven; for more tips look for us on\nYouTube!", "SZuJbQ4tcnY": "this treehouse is a lot of fun and this swing is awesome

this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe

drink is called a gummy bear it's another variation of the gummy bear there are a couple of different ways to make it this is one of the more popular ones and this is going to be a shot okay so first of all let's start off by getting a shot glass then our greedy n't sar gonna be raspberry vodka sweet flavored raspberry flavor peach schnapps sweet peach flavor sweet and sour bar mix which is just a reconstituted citrus juice usually lemon-lime sweetened non-alcoholic and of course some lemon-lime soda sprite 7up whatever you have so let's get going making the drink right now so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a shot so we've got to chill it before we put it into our glass and just put it in our mixing Cup let's get it over here we're gonna use 3/4 of an ounce of our raspberry vodka 3/4 of an ounce of our peach schnapps 1/2 ounce of our sweet and sour mix ok now we're going to shake it up to get all of these things mixed together alright here we go fill it up about 3/4 of the way there we go alright then what we're going to do is add a little of our lemon-lime soda so we're gonna give us some carbonation here here we go ok there we have it gummybear enjoy it you", "ljcgjjlh8-o": "today i'm going to explain to you how to make infused gummies now this is assuming you already have some product to put into the gummies in this case i'm going to use two and a half grams of fico that i made you can also use infused coconut oil or shatter if you're using shatter you have to decarb it first you're also going to need a non-stick pan a spatula a dropper three ounces of flavored gelatin one box which is one ounce it contains four packets of unflavored gelatin a juice of your choice but it can't be citrus so it can't be grapefruit or orange juice in this case i'm just going to use some peach juice one and a half cups i've divided them up you're going to need a half a cup of honey and you can also use some extra flavoring this is very super concentrated actually and since mine is lime today i'm going to use about eight drops of this you're also going to need silicone gummy trays size is up to you completely and a cutting board the first thing i like to do is to get my unflavored gelatin ready which is setting it to bloom so i'm going to take one half a cup of my juice and i'm going to pour it on the gelatin and i'm going to let it bloom for five minutes so we're just gonna set that aside for now generally like to give it a little bit of a stir and we'll just set that aside next what we're going to do is in this saucepan on medium to low we're going to put our flavored gelatin one cup of juice our honey and our product and now we stir you're stirring until everything is combined it can usually take 8 to 10 minutes and we just stir and stir and still it until it starts to thicken and then after five minutes we will add our bloomed unflavored gelatin now that our unflavored gelatin has bloomed and it's very chunky in consistency we're going to add that in and we're going to start mixing until it's all dissolved at this point if you want you can use a whisk as opposed to a spatula i like to use a spatula you can also use an immersion blender if you want i like to use a spatula because it lets me scrape the sides the longest part is in fact the stirring once this is all dissolved we can add some of our flavoring if we want and the flavoring is completely optional you do not have to add it once everything is blended nice nicely now i can add my extra flavoring i just added about six drops it's important that you keep stirring at all times i'm going to turn my heat down a little bit because i don't want it boiling we mix that all in and now we're ready to transfer it to our gummy trays the reason for the cutting board is because the gummy trays they move around a lot and if it's full once your trays are full then it becomes a little bit of a chore to try and get it moved once they're full i take my dropper i feel it yes it's time consuming but i like things neater some people do messy pores and you will spill some but the benefit is then you get to eat it after it hardens you're going to fill all your trays and then you're going to let them cool down to room temperature then you can put them in the fridge i like to air dry mine for 48 hours once they come out of the fridge on parchment paper so that they aren't very sticky once again once all your trays are full you're going to let them cool at room temperature and then you can put them in the fridge overnight works great and then pop them out in the morning onto parchment paper and let them air dry for a day or two some people roil them roll them in sugar or you can just enjoy them thanks", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys",

fruit gummies when you can have peanut butter and jelly gummies or Nutella gummies hello everyone starting off with a medium-sized saucepan and you'll need one and a half cups of nut milk like almond milk or cashew milk or you can even use coconut milk for this then add in one tablespoon of honey if you want these to be a bit sweeter you can add more than one tablespoon then 1/4 cup of smooth peanut butter now heat this over medium heat stirring until it comes to a boil and by that point I switched to a whisk just to make sure all the peanut butter had melted and dissolved into the mixture and once it comes to a boil as soon as you see it boiling take it off the heat and you're gonna add in four tablespoons of unsweetened gelatin powder now don't add it in too quickly here I add it a little bit too much you can see it started clumping up so I used a whisk to try to break up those clumps what you need to do is just sprinkle a little bit in at a time over the surface just let it sit for just 3-4 seconds and then take your whisk and I just kind of gently poked at it to try to get it into the mixture and then whisked it and it was fine now if you do have cups of gelatin left over after you're done stirring it in put it back on the heat bring it back to a boil give it another whisk and you'll be fine they'll dissolve I poured mine into another container just because it had a spout for ease of pouring now it's time to pour your hot mixture into some molds now the plastic molds that you use for chocolate work really well the only thing you have to do with the plastic ones is to lightly spray them with cooking spray it's just so that when the jellies are set they're easier to remove from the pan the silicone molds II don't necessarily have to grease and less they're very intricate and have lots of detail and then you can let them sit at room temperature or put them in the fridge until they are set completely now I decided to make some filled gummies kind of like those fruit gusher candies that have the liquid in the middle so I took these little miniature silicone muffin pans and I fill it halfway up with the hot mixture then I put them in the refrigerator and I let them set until when I touch the surface it felt like the surface had a skin on it like the surface was set but it wasn't necessarily set all the way through then I put some Nutella in a ziploc bag with a corner cut off and I put a little tiny dollop in the center as you can see as I'm putting the Nutella on it kind of stinks it down a little like a waterbed but the reason you wait until you have a little skin there is to keep the filling from sinking to the bottom so I did some Jam as well for peanut butter and jam and once that's all done you're gonna take some of that mixture and you're gonna pour it over top of your fillings now if the mixture in your porn container has started to set all you have to do is put it in the microwave for 10-15 seconds give it a stir and it'll be melted again and it'll be usable so pour it over let them set at room temperature or pop them in the fridge and you have some filled gummies now for Nutella gummies it's the same process one and a half cups of almond milk then you're gonna add in a quarter cup of Nutella I don't add honey for this one because Nutella has lots of sugar in it to begin with same idea heat this until it's boiling and for the Nutella I found whisking it quite a bit was required because the Nutella kind of stays clumpy so I had to keep whisking it to get it nice and smooth once it comes to a boil take it off the heat and they're gonna do the same thing you're gonna sprinkle in four tablespoons of the gelatin over the surface just lightly sprinkle it stirring after each time now four tablespoons of gelatin equals about five of those little envelopes that are usually in the Knox gelatin boxes if you know what I'm talking about if you have Knox gelatin where you are in envelopes you need five of them okay same idea pour them into moulds now where they're set remove them from your molds and you can store them in a covered container in the refrigerator and there they are now how did they taste well it's a little strange the peanut butter ones taste like peanut butter it's just a bit strange because you don't expect the flavor peanut butter to go with gummy it's just a very strange kind of a combination and the texture of these they are a little like very firm jello they're not that gummy like like I like a traditional gummy that you would buy at a store they're a little bit more tender and that because of the nut milk that's and then they're a little bit creamy now that my favorite ones were the peanut butter and jelly gummies or the jellies or whatever you want to call them when you bite into them because the jam is sealed in there and you squeeze it and bite into it the jam kind of squirts out and anyway it just tastes really good tastes like peanut butter and jelly and my second favorite one or my next favorite one I should say were the peanut butter and Nutella ones so when I make these again you know I don't know if I would make him again they were fun to make the first time and it was very interesting to try and it's just a very strange texture when you're talking about peanut butter the Nutella ones were good except I found that the Nutella flavor was kind of mild they weren't all that more all that flavorful to tell you the truth so anyway it was fun to try and maybe you can give him a try and let me know what you think now if you're looking for more traditional style gummies you might want to give these ones a try these ones are fruit flavored and they use a jell-o gelatin as well as unflavored gelatin and these are more gummy like thick they're quite stretchy and they're quite firm when you bite into them more like a traditional gummy if you want to see this video go ahead and click right on your screen or look for the link in the

amazing and they look pretty cool to take 100 grams of tequila 35 grams of grenadine about 210 grams of caster sugar along with 30 grams of orange juice which I forgot to show here and 3 sachets of gelatine okay you're going to want to put the tequila and orange juice into a pan on no heat and stir in the gelatin until that's all dissolved once that's done turn the heat up to high and add sugar and then just mix that end into this all result then you're going to want to pour that into a pan and you have to put in the fridge for about 4 hours so they're set then you want to measure out 35 grams of grenadine and add 35 grams of water then we're going to repeat the process again so add the gelatin into a cold pan and stir it until it's completely dissolved and then add the sugar turn up to high and stay there until it's all resolved then you get your mix out the fridge and pour in the most recent mix to create the second layer and then just put that back into the fridge for about another four hours once that's done just get it out and cut it up into squares if you want at this stage you can add some icing sugar to make it look cool those were delicious so a magazine how you

like a flatline okay point 14 you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't

child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "Eur8gsv2FT0": "hello guys and I will be showing you pull punch with snacks cannot turn so tastes like to punch and carry this s we're here so tell your dog where's our biggest juice phone condos apple grape peach up over here so like", "0LmNPBhX0n4": "hey youtube its idea Sanders of urban spinster comm where we are creating our own agenda dispelling societal myths and redefining the word spinster well if you are like me I'm working from home during this coronavirus pandemic I'm able to go to work maybe a day or two out of the week it just really depends on what the demands are I do work in a essential field I work in health care but I am in the corporate area of help healthcare finance patient financial services billing collecting customer service that type of thing so we go in as need it but we can primarily work from home so I'm glad about that what I wanted to talk to you about today is CMOS there is this trend of CMOS for your nutrition it's said to boost your energy be helpful for joints can help with your immune system inflammation and of course with the corner virus going on people are trying to push self care and health more than ever I think because it was happening at this time so what I did was I bought some CMOS gummies a lot of people are putting CMOS in a kind of a gummy bear type of form the kind of bots are from a company called kinetic Science Institute their bottles come like this it's kind of like a handmade label the print is super tiny I don't know if you can see that but CMOS elderberry gummy bears so they're gummy bears the ingredients are elderberry CMOS agave spring water lime and love they taste pretty good but they are not a gummy consistency so I'll take one now I took one earlier this morning so this is what they look like and then kind of like just disintegrates in your mouth but you need to keep these refrigerated if you're gonna buy gummy CMOS gummies are any kind of gummy type of thing online make sure that you do not skimp on the shipping these because they are organic they break down really quickly I can see it just kind of like dissolved so you need to keep them refrigerated I got two days shipping the company does pack it in a styrofoam box inside of a box and they put a little pack of ice so it's like a generic ice pack that you would get from a drugstore and she might put on your head your shoulder whatever so that's where it comes in and with the two days of course that ice is going to melt so as soon as you get these you need to put them in the refrigerator right away I just took mine out for the video but I found within five or ten minutes I was feeling the effects of the CMOS because I have a lot of allergy symptoms science sinus inflammation and stuff like that I'm waking up in the middle of the night to blow my nose because I can feel my nose running so just one nostril is running the other nostril is completely closed so I'm having a hard time breathing I've always had allergies pollen dust found I was allergic to wheat recently and because I was just sneezing sneezing and sneezing I didn't know what it was and someone told me well why don't you try to eliminate wheat from your diet wish I did and then I felt a lot better but right now in LA it's windy it's a lot of dirt and dust flying around so that's probably what has me irritated I'm trying to stop taking allergy medication every day especially something like like a allegra d sir-sir tic or something like that that's non-drowsy because of course I need to function during the day but what really knocks my sneezing and itchiness out is benadryl and of course benadryl it dries you up and you're gonna be asleep so I didn't want that but this CMOS I immediately felt my nostrils opened up the mucus that I had it was basically thinning it I could breathe I took one as soon as I got the package delivered and that was around maybe like 1 or 2 o'clock yesterday and then I took one before bed now this does not give you any kind of instruction as far as how often you should take it I'm taking 2 a day because I was on Instagram and someone else was selling CMOS gummies and that was their recommendation now there's the other company does not have elderberry in it elderberry is supposed to be the thing that I'm online right now James your inflammation lessen stress some experts recommend elderberry to help prevent and ease cold and flu symptoms so this is what theorist is infused with I've seen apple or elderberry either one I haven't seen really any other flavor than that so I don't really know what the Apple is gonna do other than try to make it taste better but these cost think I've paid about $30 before the shipping and I get 50 of these I've seen people sell a bottle of 30 gummies for 60 bucks if you're taking them twice a day you're in two weeks out of that so that's kind of expensive I think these are really went with them because they were cheap but they do work so you know think about your price point and what you want to use them for now I will say iodine is commonly found in CMOS or has a lot of iodine in it from from what I'm reading it's a rich source of iodine so you have to be careful with that especially if you have acne prone skin like I do noticed that the more iodine I have in my system I'll break out especially on my nose specifically when it's iodine related and that is a shellfish I eat shrimp or a dish with a lot of shrimp in it sometimes like maybe I'll get a rice dish or something and I know they only put like two or three shrimp in it and I'll get extra shrimp the next day I have a pimple here or here it's always my nose so think about that when you're taking supplements that have iodine you don't want to put too much especially if your body is reacting and sometimes you don't even know what your body is reacting to you just see the blemish there my dog is just walking around aimlessly you hear all that tap tap tap and that's her nails on the floor and they're already short so no her nails don't need to be good but what are you doing penguin she's had her walk she's fed she just has nothing to do so but that's my review of the kinetic Science Institute gonna do it there they haven't really taste like anything I mean it doesn't have a bad flavor it has a slight berry like I showed you it disintegrates you gotta put it in the fridge be careful of taking any supplements and have iodine when you have acne-prone skin I'm taking two a day they don't say how many didn't take but it's a supplement it's not food it's not for you to just be popping them like candy okay so if you have any other questions for me you can put them below in the comments let me show you that I am wearing my merch my never set on urban spinster this is the slouchy shirt so it has like a a wider neckline that you can you know play around with if you want to be sighs I'm where it is medium so this is a medium I could probably go bigger to make it kind of more slouchy but this is the fleece kind of like a spongy fleece is very very warm so that in mind comes in multiple colors you don't have to get this color so go on to the link below in the comments and you can get your merch I have this slouchy neck sweatshirt and I also have one that's a crewneck so it kind of comes up here again multiple colors multiple sizes so check that out if you didn't already make sure you're listening to my podcast my last topic was are you dating a narcissist so some people don't even know they're dating the narcissist and not only identify if that person is a narcissist or not we are also talking about how to break up with them and break that cycle okay once you identify this is a type of person that you're dealing with so make sure you check the podcast out again urban semester comm I have my single women's agenda guided journals there online for PDF download and please share tell your friends if there's some other product that you want me to review let me know in the comments you can also email me if you don't want your comment to be public alright be safe out there make sure you I don't know if you supposed to wear masks or not they keep flip-flopping and going back and forth I have no idea but I have my mask so if you have to go out in public wear your mask here in LA our grocery store or one of the main chains they're gonna start putting up plexiglass which is kind of hood ish but I guess they're trying to protect their employees primarily and then of course the customer so the plexiglass is supposed to go up at the cashier's check stand or whatever you want to call it the register this ones be putting all this glass stuff so we'll see it happened in one store that I'm aware of I have a senior someone told me so it's supposed to be coming I do know someone who has passed away Jory Bohannon RIPT to him and condolences out go go out to the Bohannon family he was 39 years old bus driver in Santa Clarita Area California and it's very unfortunate because now you know we cannot have funerals you can't have large gatherings so I'm wondering how they're going to celebrate his life so you know you guys be safe out there I'm really tempted to get my nails done see if my girl is working still working from home or or what but what I may have to do is just file this gel off and this this is hard gel this is not gel polish I can't soak this I got a file and I do not have a drill so that's gonna be a project so I may do a video on that and then which products work best for very brittle natural nails as long as I get out of this my nails are gonna be super super weak I haven't worn my nails with nothing on them no product on them for many years alright so wish me luck on that alright I will talk to you soon and you guys have a good one", "FwBHy9h2iPk": "[Music] we are not just sweet tooth we also love our sweets to be huge when it comes to gummy bears they should be giant we prefer enormous cookies and gigantic candies watch large versions of sweets in our new video my friend enjoys her Ferrero but she knows that I love it too I wonder how she will react to my version of this candy add Nutella to Nesquik breakfast cereal mix it crush some of the cereal into crumbs and add to the mixture stir it nicely and let the mass harden in a bowl melt 18 ounces of chocolate in the double boiler add 4 ounces of ground hazelnut or some other nuts take the hardened mass out of the bowl turn it over and cover with Nutella put one more identical half on top shaping a ball and cover it with a melted chocolate and nut mixture wrap the candy with golden wrapping paper when it hardens decorate a baking mold of an appropriate size with a golden paper strip [Music] put in the giant candy print out a label and attach it on top my friend even drops her candy when she sees my Ferrara giant a huge Ferrero is like hitting the jackpot in the candy world we unfold the wrapper and bite off the candy there is so much chocolate we can't do without a spoon even two of us won't be able to cope with this gigantic candy a tender macaroon is so delicious and so small I wish I could make a bigger version of it thoughts are things a big macaron is already on our table we will need a few sponge cakes of identical size sprinkle colourful sugar paste with powdered sugar and roll it out wrap the sponge cake with it fold the edges inside wrap the second cake the same way melt confectionery glaze in a double boiler and spread it over the sides of the third cake it'll imitate a cream layer roll out the sugar paste to make a thin flat strip fold it several times and roll it out to create a macaroon middle layer [Music] attach the folded sugar paste to the edges of the top and the bottom layers cover the cakes with condensed milk and assemble the macaron put the cream sponge cake in the middle and the sugar paste cakes go on top and bottom the giant macaron has a royal look the only thing left to do is to cut off a piece of it when macaron will be enough to treat all lovers of the delicate dessert my friend promised to make a surprise gift for me I love surprises I'm looking forward to see what she's prepared I tried to restrain myself from peeping well I'm ready now you may look Wow holy guacamole is a gigantic milkshake I can't believe how lucky I am add 50 fluid ounces of milk to nine ounces of raspberry jam or syrup with it with a mixer beat up five ounces of whipping cream separately [Music] cover the cocktail with the whipped cream decorate it with candy fruit and marshmallow on top redhead adds a wafer cone to the cocktail it's really hard to cope with this amount of whipped cream even for a true sweet tooth for starters we need to take a cocktail straw I choose the nicest one I will name this gigantic cocktail friendship because you can't drink it alone for sure you need a friend to help you this huge dessert will be enough to stuff both of us there are very marvelous and colorful candied fruit here well you shouldn't have touched my wafer cone I saved it to enjoy the whipped cream later on look what is it oops my friends nose is covered with the whipped cream and I look like a unicorn there are never too many gummy bears my friend and I eat them trying to outrace each other but the package is empty now and we start fighting for the last gummy candy as usual my friend doesn't want to give it up at all look the bear dies a hero's death but what do we see it's resurrected as a gigantic fair Idol add water to fruit jelly powder make a highly concentrated mixture pour it into a bear shaped silicone mold and let it harden in a cold place [Music] take the bear out of the mold when it hardens it doesn't matter how big the bear is we will cope with it any way we argue to the bitter end and draw lots for the right to eat the bear rock paper fair at last we meet halfway we cut our giant gummy in half now we face a challenge of eating it the one who eats it first wins we tie after a persistent chewing fight the plates are empty and the Bears are over a big tea party is going to begin it's high time to bake a big cookie for it draw a grid on a honey cake to imitate the real cookie use a wooden skewer cut out the squares carefully score notches across the edge of the cookie with the blunt side of the knife cover the second cake with a thick layer of Nutella put the cake with a grid on top leave little cookies for the next time we have the gigantic cookie you can hardly hold it in your hand a big cookie has only one disadvantage you can't dip it into your teeth because it doesn't fit into a regular Cup but it is easy to fix wham now it's a different story giant cups and a giant cookie is a match made in heaven we will need corrugated tube and two pieces of foam plastic trace the diameter of the tube on the foam plastic and cut out two circles make a slanting cut on the ends of the tube and attach the foam plastic circles [Music] attach the tube to a white flower pot this is the handle of the cup paint the tube white and put the cup on a white coaster [Music] you can dip an entire cake into such a cup as for the maxi cookie you can easily dip it into your tea and crunch the yummy I love juice which one should I choose orange mmm yummy or cherry I will mix different kinds of juice into one cocktail to solve the choice problem pour cherry juice into a wide container use a funnel and a slanted straw to pour orange juice on top put the straw to the side of the container in this way the juice will not mix creating a separate layer put the straw into the middle and pour carrot and apple juice between the layers decorate the prepared cocktail with a slice of grapefruit and add straws well you will get a year's dose of vitamins from the cocktail like this it is not just healthy it also looks lovely it's the cocktail with an ombre effect blondie is amazed it will definitely be enough for two of us I treat my friend to it this cocktail must be served only in a bar for Giants this is what we call a long drink redhead doesn't want to wake up she pretends to be ill and lazy but I know how to pull her out of the bed she won't be able to say no I will cook my signature Awakening toast cut a loaf of white bread lengthwise we will need the middle put two pieces one on to another and cut off the edges forming a square put the bread into a toaster flip it over when it gets fried from one side spread Nutella over the big toast there is a secret of enormous toast the more Nutella the better I add a thick layer and go to wake up my friend redhead wakes up when she smells the toast though she couldn't tear herself off the pillow a minute ago my toasts are a universal remedy eat one huge

flavors and I'm gonna show you how to make these hi everybody today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears make with these cute little gummy bear trays I got these off of ebay and I'll leave you the link below it comes with even this little dropper so you can put it in there easy we're gonna make three different flavors so the first one we're gonna make is blueberry wait 1/2 a cup of blueberry puree I just warm them up a little bit some frozen berries and then I blended them in my blender and it makes perfect PRA like this okay so we're gonna warm up in a saucepan the blueberry puree 1/2 cup and you add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice so I was just gonna blend this up and then we're gonna add the honey when you need 2 tablespoons of the honey like that we're just gonna melt this together really nice and then we're gonna add the gelatin right now I need to add the 3 tablespoons of gelatin and just kind of spread it around so it doesn't clump up in a spot okay just mix that up until it gets kind of glossy and all the Delta mix is off okay this one looks ready okay now we're gonna make an orange juice flavor orange one so we're gonna use a cup of orange juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of honey and stir that up and now we're going to add the gelatin again three tablespoons of gelatin and stir that up till it's dissolved and it's nicely coat it together and it should look a little bit glossy so just cook it up for a little bit okay that one's ready now we're gonna do the last flavor we have strawberry all right we put the strawberries puree in there half a cup of water a tablespoon of lemon juice and again two tablespoons of honey okay on three tablespoons of gelatin that's it stir it up really good let it cook up to dissolve all the way okay that's it now I let the three flavors cool down okay I've got my trays ready I put them on top of cookie sheets so they won't be so floppy because we're gonna put them in the freezer so I'll just go ahead and fill up your flavors here I'm going to start with the orange one and I did not strain the pulp out of my oranges so we'll still have that in the gummy bears so if you want to strain yours that's fine but I did not okay now we're gonna do this strawberry too much okay okay now we're gonna do the blueberry okay if you don't have a gummy bear molds you can use any kind of pan as long as you line it I got it's a wax paper and then I'll the wax paper you can pour it in there and then once they are cooled you can pop them out I'm just have so much left over I'm just gonna mix them together kind of make like a mixed berry now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all these in the freezer and they have to freeze for about 30 minutes now if you didn't have a mold and you did it like this just let it freeze first and you could chop them up into whatever shape you want or if you have the molds that's fine you just pop them in just like this and the cookie sheet or if you don't have those molds you could use any kind of silicon molds that you have I have these ones silicones and I have these ice cubes I only have the silicone on the bottom I can't really show you now has silicone on the bottom so that they'll pop out so any one of these methods will work if you want to just try it ahead of time you don't have the gummy bear molds this you can try it like this and these I got on eBay like I said they were eight dollars and I'll leave the link in the description down below if you want to check these out they're totally a good buy so I these I got 200 gummy bears for seven dollars so that's pretty good and I came with their droppers okay so now we're just gonna put them in the freezer like this for 30 minutes and this is how they turned out we got the Stars and the leaves in strawberry and the blueberry flavor and these are the gummi bears whole pile of them here they're really small cute perfect size little gummies and then these are the ones that we had on the tree cuz we didn't have any cut out and I just cut them into cubes shape I'm they're perfect - they're really nice you could try any one of the shapes or if you have something else go ahead and try it and our favorite flavor was these strawberry ones here so let's you try it and tell me which flavor you guys like and like subscribe", "mgllweLNll4": "hey hey guys and welcome back welcome back to my channel I know it's been a minute but I'm back and this morning I'm coming to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work thank you guys for watching if you like if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel I'm sorry I've been away for a while but I will be more consistent with posting videos so I hope you guys have a great great day do great things for you and your loved ones and until next time see you guys later bye", "E3aJKfETuaQ": "who wants to talk CBD this guy does and let me tell you what today I've got the fun stuff the CBD gummy bears oh yeah [Music] what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do um with these I'm not gonna lie there's a whole lot of things that you can say and you can't say about CBD because obviously like we covered the FDA hasn't approved of anything but let me tell you what they do for me what they do for me I'll leave these at night right before bed like a half hour hour before bed somewhere around there I'm out like a light I sleep I mean I'm out I used to be the guy who tossed and turn to go to bed sit there flip through my phone for you know an hour or two no I go right to bed I also have a day job believe it or not this isn't the only gig work at a warehouse I walk around a lot a lot a lot and with all that walking around you know I got aches and pains these these help with the aches and pains okay um and that's that's personal experience that's just me telling you again the FDA didn't doesn't say that's what it will do what it won't - etc etc I'm just telling you from personal experience so again check the description below you're gonna find a link delivered directly to the product get yourself something all right trust me get yourself something just try it do yourself a favor and just try so until next time it needs your boy big J for

time watching the channel and you love watching Harry doozy on this occasion pure Hellfire synthesized into a tiny little bite-sized piece of food then you're in the right place so think about subscribing but today we are doing the today we're doing the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear now this thing clocks in nine million scovilles which is not the hottest thing I've ever eaten but it's not enough that has got me very worried that means it's 900 times hotter than a jalapeno I'm like three times hotter than police pepper spray and I'm three for three now on spicy challenges I successfully finished the one ship challenge the Death Note and the world's hot chocolate bar but I failed the tuatara which was 30 million scovilles almost call an ambulance the toe of satan and the chicken wings britain's hot chicken wings from a couple of weeks ago so i'm hoping to make it four out of seven today which means i'm more successful than unsuccessful but as most you know by now I really hate spicy food I actually got this from a very kind subscriber it came in a big care package full of stuff but I've gone back to our messages and I can't find out the name of the person that sent this to me but if you did send us me it really means the world to me just hopefully I don't die and we don't get your honor manslaughter charges but um yeah the rules of this thing are two minutes in your mouth and then after you've swallowed it's five minutes after boom that's always the tricky part for me so without further ado this is Benny's food and this is the world's hottest gummy bear challenge right so it's one single gummy bear shouldn't be this hard oh there we go right so far is not too bad you know they said you got to move around alpha he's got very very slowly you start to salivate more now oh I shall we will it's still there well the videos I've seen says don't chew it too much you don't wanna break it down before two minutes but now that's not it's not melting so my troops I can swallow after two minutes so it's hot hiccup results when you know if you hiccup it's like a million or so at least your alternate hook is long well why not this wins but both see around the mouth it's not true people won't believe that okay bro but I'll show it to the camera so OD milk me are these two day two days past its sell-by date it's really guess the roof of the mouth it's weird are different things some get you here some get you the throat this is a dry out of the roof yeah the book ready yet the milk ready why do you do this every time just getting ready please I feel like sucking Bartoli helps a bit in a weird way thank you I think it's kind of level it out this is looking secret it's really bright 22nd of September 24th today okay so I got to get to six minutes I think it's taper it off now let's stop like it got a little a little drip on the end of my schnoz didn't you see no camera you look a little bit yeah you look a little bit disappointed I think you expected more pain right I expected more pain thankfully we only have wood anymore stuff right so he finished that kind of was mostly around the roof of the mouth yeah I'm not I'm normally absolutely desperate for it or ice cream or something but get a little on single little face tingle not too not too much it ahead know what tastes good it's not lump it's fine it's it it says it's nine million I'm not sure if it's because of the way it's kind of made into the gummy bear it's nowhere near the toss it table sayin oh but the giant they're really giant gummy bear that'd be brutal we don't normally have whole milk goodness this is this is usually a skim a skimmed milk household so I've got a whole middle but yeah that's a pretty good if you want bragging rights I would say that's a good challenge to do because it's it says it's nine million scovilles but that wasn't quite as far as the one ship the wardship I found quite hard this is unpleasant but it's not I don't think you could do it most people that are you know don't make her enormous salts will probably find it quite difficult and quit but if you don't I mean I don't like spicy food at all and that's doable I'm okay no I'm not absolutely chug in the milk and asking for Ben and Gary sorry I didn't think that will be actually quite a lot more entertaining oh thanks for watching catch catch you at

sure of rosehips red raspberry leaf nettle alfalfa oat straw peppermint and lemon grass it is helpful to have a little funnel when you go to pour into the mold so if you have a little funnel grab it do it together come on back over here to check on our stuff almost there starting to kind of wow I don't even really see it and it's kind of starting to like steam their bubbles are kind of starting in there you kind of see the texture change just keep mixing it up see it's starting to starting to boil once to boil the little bubbles kind of start to form in there it will go to like something that actually looks like a boil here in a second oh yeah we're getting it all right see the little bubbles it's gonna keep stirring yeah and they come on like instantaneously it's almost time all right so that's a pretty good bubble there so I'm just going to remove it from the heat and then I'm gonna grab my my tincture here and my tablespoon eighth guy here all right so this is a 1 tablespoon I'm just gonna get four tablespoons out all right I'm gonna give that a good mix so the reason when we take it off the heat is we don't want to lower vitamins to be leached out by the heat and boiled out so we take it off the heat mix it pretty good in there and that way you just make sure that your dosage is equal and then you take it and you're gonna pour it into your mold but I am oh he's a little more in this cactus guy I ran into this last time that I had a little bit extra so when you have a little bit extra you can put it in whatever you have so let's go see what I have over here these little cups so you can just kind of put them in little like shallow dishes and make other little extra because this will start to solidify so I had a lot of fun eating the gummy out of the bottom of this pan last time I did gummies they were fun or gummies does it gonna be a big gummy so after you get it all poured in God think it's getting don't want to drop out it's gonna be like a jello Cup gummy it's gonna be so good for you so good alright so after you get the port all you got to do is put it in your refrigerator freezer depending on how quick you want them and you're done so if you guys have any questions about the gummies drop them below and I am bored so I will get to your answers very quickly I hope you have a great day thanks for watching if you like this kind of content you can donate we are the human experience we are trying to keep our business afloat in the time where we can't do massage so I will drop the link below if you would like to donate or you can be entered in as one of them I think it is $11 a month and you get a whole bunch of amazing content just check it out message the human experience and see you soon thanks for watching guys", "QovKXCWfXpY": "mine's gonna just try the jello part that doesn't have a sugar better welcome to ryan toysreview yeah so Ryan's favorite color is green so we decided to make green gummies so we're gonna use a hundred and eight of these jello packets and yeah yeah and 20 of these unflavored Lots packet because we want to make gummies so they have to be pretty hard [Music] [Applause] that's how much we can have left to go we're slowly finishing the packets look how much powder we use it almost fill up and I guess we have to use all of this because we wanted super hard gummies right now we're going to add in some warm hot water [Music] now we have to stir it together [Music] Wow so this is super hot so only an adult can do it [Music] and so you got all these residue left over here that we have to just throw away because it will not dissolve it just looks like it's still watering let's see if we can take it out on you joining us is mr any case number last time I ate that gel here I think so huh let's see it's gonna work that means it like yeah [Music] [Music] we can take it out and put it on oh these are hard like nothing but sugar probably very well there's still powder over here feel that big gummy Oh what is it -

To start this project, you\u2019ll need something\nto mold your gummies, and I\u2019m using these Star Wars trays that my brother got me for\nChristmas. You should be able to find them online, or at one of the novelty stores at\nyour local shopping mall. The trays are silicone and actually designed\nfor freezing ice cubes, but they work impressively well for making chocolates, and gummy candies\nas well. Now all you need to start casting your clones,\nis a big bag of gummy bears. So go ahead and dump the entire bag on the counter, because\nthey\u2019ll all need to be sorted out in just a second. The cool thing about using gummy bears, is\nthat the candy is already made. So that means you don\u2019t have to worry about following\na recipe or messing around with food coloring, and flavoring. Instead, all you need to do\nis figure out a way to liquify them so you can pour them into the molds. Get busy separating all the colors into different\npiles, and you\u2019ll probably end up with mountains of red, green, white, yellow, and orange,\nwhich in this case all seem to be fairly even. With the colors sorted out, it\u2019s time to\ngrab a microwave safe container like a glass measuring cup. Fill the container with as many, same color\ngummy bears as you feel like, then simply put it in the center of the microwave, and\nnuke it for around 10-15 seconds. If it needs a bit more than that, don\u2019t go longer than\n10 seconds at a time, because you\u2019ll end up making a really big mess on the inside. The syrup is ready when all the gummy bears\nhave melted completely, and the gummy goo is just runny enough that you can pour it.\nWhich is exactly what we\u2019re going to do next. Slowly and carefully pour the molten gummy\ngoodness into the ice cube trays, and try to resist the temptation to lick it, or pour\nit in your mouth. It\u2019s really hot and will probably burn you, so be careful and use something\nlike a spatula to catch the drips instead. These will need some time to cool, so while\nwe\u2019re waiting, let\u2019s go ahead and melt down all the other gummy bears as well, and\nfill up the rest of the molds the exact same way. When the trays are filled, give the syrup\nabout half an hour to cool on the counter, then carefully move them to the fridge so\nthey\u2019ll firm up as much as possible. They\u2019re going to take about 5 hours to fully\nset, but when they\u2019re finished, go ahead and pop the gummies out of the molds, and\ntake a good look at what you\u2019ve created. You can see there\u2019s a fantastic amount of\ndetail that gets captured in the candies, which is impressive considering how quick\nand simple they are to make. Now with more intricate molds, like the stormtrooper\nhelmets, it might take a bit of stretching and prying to get the candies to come out,\nbut you\u2019ll see that once they release, they quickly spring back into shape. Keep in mind that there\u2019s really no limit\non how big you can make your candies either. So let your imagination run wild with that\nidea, and see how far it takes you. Well now you know how to transform a bag of\ngummy bears into a tasty batch of colorful Star Wars gummies, that you could randomly\nbust out at the next Cosplay party, or simply use to bribe your kids. By the way, if you don\u2019t want to spend money\non big bags of gummy bears, there\u2019s a much cheaper option you can try instead. I used\nJell-O, gelatin, and a bit of corn syrup to make mountains of colorful LEGO gummies that\nlook and taste just as good. Look for my recipe on how to make these, in another project video. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

very small so be very easy for you to carry these wherever you go in your pocket handbag book bag wherever and we have well card from them go you you've got them now clean caffeine 100% all-natural energy locale low carb punched Jimmy's fastest energy there is please give us a five-star amazon review or let us know how it's going yo at punched energy calm use 4-pack review on punched energy calm for a discount hashtag punched energy hashtag be better hashtag deeper wall natural caffeine gummies [Music] all right so I got four of them naturally as with any caffeinated product now you do want to be mindful of your own individual tolerance so can as always consume responsibly because these are caffeinated these are not normal gummies so I wouldn't be handing these out to your kids for tennis treats unless you want them bouncing off the walls and of course be careful how many you yourself consume because too much caffeine can be dangerous all right so we have some nutritional information back here again low cattle low carb real fruit fat-free big boost you go you eat gummies is equal to one cup of joe or one cup of coffee so you use that as it means I figure out how much you should do there's two servings per pack serving size for gummies okay so there's eight gummies in here or in other words this this packet of gummies amounts to a cup of coffee so you be the judge about what that means for you and consume responsibly what we have here is a serving size calorie count of 26 calories there is no fat no cholesterol no sodium there's eight grams of carbohydrates no fiber total sugars five grams protein one gram caffeine 40 milligrams and that's per serving there's two servings per package that means if you eat this whole thing you'll be consuming 80 milligrams of caffeine calcium zero iron 400 mcg vitamin C 15 milligrams and for the ingredients we have natural fruit juice concentrate apple grape lime orange passion fruit peach organic brown rice syrup organic cane sugar purified water gelatin natural caffeine from green coffee beans fruit pectin and pieces citric acid coconut oil natural carnauba leaf wax green coffee being a caffeine clean label I distributed by punch energy made in the USA so this is a United States product so let's get one of these open and yes I am going to eat the whole bag because for a person like myself as significant caffeine and with a little smoke good oh okay well straight away I know I can't communicate smell through a video at least what not with current technology but these smell really good make a Yankee Candle out of this call it punched candles movies Holloway there get some gummies out of here all right so there's your eight gummies now doesn't really say what each of these gummies are but that's okay you're going to be eating them all anyway so here we have it they look like old gummy bears crystallized gummy bears they smell magnificent so no kidding about the make a Yankee Candle out of it because that would be really nice all right so we're going to try we'll sort them according to color hopefully that means they taste the same I'm guessing this one that's gonna be a great because it's kind of purplish I'm not sure it's good that was not great I think it was more I think I was blueberry that was pretty nice all right let me try one of these this is kind of like a red one this must be one of the passion for it ones really good all right so we have kind of like a dark yellow one I'm guessing possibly Apple it's really sweet okay yes see this one is the orange yeah [Music] really good okay those are really really sweet and tasty and smell good the bouquet of these things like I said should be made into a Yankee king candle because it smells so good if punched energy ever sees this video please make a candle I will buy it but their gummies are really tasty each package as it says on the front actually has 80 milligrams of caffeine so again consume responsibly how much 80 milligrams of caffeine effects here just depends on you so just be aware of that and consume accordingly for myself my my range of caffeine tolerance is anywhere from between a hundred and fifty milligrams to 250 milligrams of caffeine a day so if it's less the 150 milligrams I probably won't feel that if it's over 250 milligrams I start to get sleepy but long as I keep it within that range I do just fine in terms of having the energy to do work do exercise so on and so forth I will not be eating any more of these today because I've already consumed a significant amount of caffeine through other ways but this would be an excellent way of having caffeine on demand and a a really great tasting gummy and they just they smell good too they smell so good it's almost a it's almost a shame to eat them because they spell that good so you know before you before you eat them just give it a good sniff give a good real good sniff because they they smell awesome so good so yeah I totally recommend the punched energy gummies it's a great way to have good tasting portable energy that also smells good yes I totally recommend this product buy some today", "cqOSNzxo7Mo": "-Vat19
