t-mobile customers like this one right here so this week so far i got the t-mobile i got a t-mobile uh what is it i think i got a t-mobile face mask at the house i know i got t-mobile gloves that i

grow room or just for the car or something type all right it works oh yeah with the lanyard that's what's up but it's free so you can't go wrong with free see i remember when i told you i was a laborer i'm saying this is my uh my union local 872 yeah i'm saying la una shout out to la una but uh y'all remember when i told you i was a laborer i just got this in the mail a couple days ago i knew nothing about this like i knew absolutely nothing about this i thought i cashed out all my monies and all that [ __ ] but look at this 389 bro i wasn't a laborer since 2017. y'all been holding my money for what four years now well three years about to be four oh man i'm finna cash out give me all my money i need it now i'm gonna use that 389 to pay for like some more grow equipment i'm about to get some seeds online and [ __ ] what else i'm about to get with that [ __ ] [ __ ] i was gonna get some jordans but nah i'm gonna put most of this towards my growth yeah i'm saying so i'm gonna just get some more equipment probably some seeds and put some in storage for the show what up youtube so it's day number 53 from c for my three uh sun dwarf uh sunspot dwarf sunflowers and it's about that time that the pollen needs to get transferred from one sunflower to the other because if not then i will not get sunflower seed you know i'm saying they have to get uh pollinated in order to create seed so um i forgot all about that until i started seeing uh pollen dropping from the like you see all that yellow that's all the sunflowers pollen dropping from the sunflower and i was like oh [ __ ] i forgot i do need to pollinate these so it's easy all you need is a q-tip a cotton swab q-tip and basically all you're gonna do is just you know play uh you know bumblebee you're just gonna recreate what happens in nature you know bumblebees they have all that fur on their legs and stuff and all that fur around their body so when they're going in and you know like taking all kind of like nectar from the flower pollen is you know being captured on all those hairs so when they fly from one flower to the other it's still piling from that last flower that gets transferred to the other flower that's why bees are so important in nature you gotta have if we don't have bees in nature we're done as humans and the bee population is dying down and it's sad to say and it's sad to see but it's just the world we're living in right now so with that being said um this one right here is the most mature so i'm gonna really swab her down and i'm gonna just transfer it to this one and i'm gonna use that transfer to that one and i'm gonna just repeat it you know probably a couple of and i have to do this at least once a day to make sure that it's fully pollinated so i can get the most seeds out of each sunflower plant so let's go ahead and get in there and start so we'll start with this one because it's the most mature look at that just dropping piling everywhere every which away gotta collect all that so you see all that pollen on there it's real yellow basically you're just going to go around each plant and do the same thing yeah i'm saying and hopefully uh i didn't wait too late because uh i didn't even think about it till just now so like i said hopefully i didn't wait too late to do this um but we'll see what i'm saying look at all this popping up and it's like all over this leaf oh yeah we'll take all of that look at that and just gently do that that pollen's flying everywhere you can't see it but i can definitely see it look at that this one was had the most pollen at all of them this one had a lot of pollen but i just kept like brushing it off and when i top uh watered the plants um all the pollen well most of the pollen from this one just washed down and i wasn't even thinking so yep that's how you do it all right y'all i'm out oh yeah did i tell y'all today again it's october 29th at uh 8 a.m and again is day number 53 from seed for each one of these sunflowers all right peace and the georgia southern college green back there in the cut all right peace what y'all want to drink y'all let me know you know what i'm saying nah i ain't frightened though i don't normally buy this much soda at one time but i was at the grocery store and they had a sale it was a four for twelve dollars for these twelve pack boxes for twelve dollars so if you add that up what's that three dollars a box oh [ __ ] i had to get it i'm saying normally these be like what like 5.99 at the gas station they'd probably be like 4.99 at the grocery store but three dollars that's like prices i had to which i want to snack on y'all let me know they also had a sale on the candies a dollar piece and i said hell my weed my medication's gonna be done so why not cause we're gonna need some munchie food y'all what up y'all so i just wanted to get my uh pineapple express fino number one from barney's farm uh pineapple express auto that is um this is the second day of his cure i chopped it down on the what's today on the 27th is the 29th right now of october and i just want to get a little close up on it real quick uh the branches they're still uh they still got moisture in them you see how they're bending like that it's not snapping that means it's still moisture in the branch and that's what you want you want a slow cure you don't want nothing fast you know what i'm saying but let's uh look at this real quick it ain't much you know i'll say eyeballing let me see eyeballing i'll say probably about a quarter ounce but let's let's get some of these shots real quick uh that uh where is that that fungus snap it's so sticky the fungus that got stuck and then died on it i'll just take that fungus nut off it ain't nothing and let me get this back on yeah pineapple express looking nice karen just right hold on let me show y'all real quick one more nude yeah so we gonna smoke good in a couple weeks style what up y'all it's halloween day october 31st uh what time is this about 7 a.m i just got off work i was just trying to show y'all the pineapple express fino number one the results of it now i know i told y'all before that i wouldn't be surprised if i only got a quarter ounce or less yeah i'm saying you saw how small that plant was so this is all of the harvest that i got from it but again it was only a auto it was only grown in a two gallon pot and i didn't do any lsting to it besides pulling a little bit of side branching so i mean obviously i'm not going to get that much weight off of it so let's see how much we got though it's a tear out i want to see all right and let's see what we working with let me pull out a nug and this is the last step before i throw it in the jar because it's been in this brown paper bag for about three to four days now and it's small so there's no need to keep it in there too long so this is the end result of my pineapple express phenol number one y'all know i like to get nice and zoomed in for you for the one time roll that [ __ ] light that [ __ ] and smoke that [ __ ] y'all remember the end of the killer cam song i don't know who the [ __ ] that was he said it's me mizzo what the [ __ ] is mizza all right let's weigh this up real quick all right let's start with this one we were just looking at so just that one nug was a gram and a half all right let's put it up here ah i dropped a little bit a little small but oh [ __ ] we almost said uh seven grams a quarter ounce oh we don't made it a quarter ounce as you saw that's that let me get this last bud that's on the floor and let's add this baby nut boom all right so we got 8.3 grams yes lovely thank you pineapple express fino number one from barney's farm you will be smoked good oh yeah all right y'all so i'm at walmart i got to get some more uh i got to get two of the same size uh containers for my compo 498 for the 18 gallons these something about getting this getting tube all right so i wound up getting these two i got these uh i got two of these the 18 gallon i think this should be big enough for i got two of them one for my veg compost and one for the flour compost what up y'all so you remember that brown paper bag that i used to uh do part two of my cure for my pineapple express before i put in the jar well i ripped it all up and i'm gonna make it a part of my compost because again when it comes to gardening nothing should go to waste not even your your uh brown paper bag that you used to cure with yeah i'm saying so that's the pineapple express in the jar looking lovely imma get it at every light angle so you can see it that look more like og kush when it's like darker like that and this is the pineapple so like i said i i'm gonna use that um that jar i mean i'm gonna use that brown paper bag plus all this because i'm about to eat some breakfast right now y'all know i'm a fan of this organic red kale right here yeah i'm saying about to eat breakfast real quick a little breakfast snack and with all the leftovers from that i'll just feed to my compost because again nothing goes to waste so i wash my hands with some uh what i'm saying with some napkins and right after i washed my hands i ripped it up and this too could go into the compost and i also washed off some of the carrots with it that's why it's dirty and the ends of the carrots compost loves that uh the ends of the red kale compost loves that i'm saying my chopped up a brown paper bag it's all brown and green right here brown and green your browns this is your browns right here this is all your browns and this is all your greens anything that has life to it is your greens and anything dead should be your browns so let's feed this to the compost join me shall we all right so here's my two compost bins one for veg well this is flour and that's veg my flour one is pretty much full because i'm about to use that one and i already used the veg so it's kind of empty so we're going to put all this in the veg compost now what i did was everything that i used i wrapped it up in this uh brown napkin and even the brown napkin could go up in the compost so i'm gonna just throw this whole thing in my hand directly in the compost and then after that you shake it up and it should be good to go the compost will break it down and do the rest of the work so um i keep my compost wrapped up in a breathable blanket at all times to prevent any kind of gnats to go in there and just mess up my whole compost bin with all kind of flies so i'm gonna open this up real quick throw this in there and close it we're gonna do it all within five seconds so let's do it right now so boom look at all that fresh compost all right and that's that and that's the veg compost heat and let me show you the flour so the flower it has some water in there i threw some water in there yesterday so i got to shake that up real quick because you don't want no sitting water like that yeah but we looking good in there though and that's that all right y'all so i'm gonna show you the before and after so this is the after i just shook them up and also you want to have a like a big ass [ __ ] plastic bag to wrap around your bin and tie a knot on it so when you shake it up all like that dookie all that compost dookie it won't uh end up on your floor like how i did mine so since my [ __ ] was so watery again your compost should not be watery but i had fed my plants a compost tea and i just poured the rest of the compost tea in both of my compost bins and it was about uh what was it it was about a quarter gallon i'm saying it was about a quarter gallons worth so um let me show you how the compost looks i already shake it up so i'm gonna lift it up real quick and shut it and after that i'll throw the blanket on it because again i don't want any kind of insect or anything to get in here and mess it up so this is the flowers compost shaken up and it smells like the worst dookie but that's exactly what you want to smell you want to smell that rotten egg dukey smell but it shouldn't smell rancid rotting it should just smell like a freshly like freshly dukied out of a cow's ass right and it's it's different kinds of smells i'm saying you gotta know the difference if it smells rancid then your compost probably to mold it up or something didn't happen in there but if it smells like it came fresh from like out of a cow's ass then you should be a1 but let's check the veg compost all right looking good so we straight you all right y'all so i just wanted to i never i don't think i've ever filmed the process well one of the processes of me germinating which is the napkin method but i'm gonna just show y'all so this is for seeds that don't really like to germinate or they'll just germinate like a little bit of a of a tap root and then it'll just die off in the soil it'll never fully develop like you'll just die so if it if your seeds are having troubles um these i just pulled them out of where is it at i just pulled them out of the water after like a 48 hour um you know 48 hour soap and as you can see most of them the tap roots are showing like you see that one right there that one right there so if it's having trouble germinating because i already tried to germinate these before and none of them came up but this time so if you're having trouble germinating all you have to do is just sprinkle a little bit of mycorrhizae on the seeds not a lot just you know just a little bit just enough so that it touches the root it doesn't even have to cover the seed long as it covers the tap root but i'm gonna just cover the seed anyway yeah i'm saying all right adam did that once you do that then you fold up your paper towels boom and and don't mind the rumbling i just got some uh something on the i'm saying boiling up some uh oily water to make this but um after you do that you want to cover up your seeds boom and boom then after that put it in a plastic bag oh look at that steamy goodness oh yeah that's a breakfast right now i don't eat this every morning for breakfast but i try to squeeze in some fresh breakfast at least once every few days but anyway all right so i just wanted to show y'all um so whenever i get uh fruit or vegetable seeds from like the grocery store that i want to save i always like to first do a test on them first just to see if the seeds are viable now um some fruits and vegetables in the stores um like the companies make it so that like in big farming all that they make it so that the seeds aren't like viable so they won't germinate i'm saying because i don't know why i don't i don't know i guess they just don't want nobody to have their product or some [ __ ] i don't understand it but um i'm gonna give you some examples because i like to test the seeds out before i say okay those are some great a seeds now if you remember a couple weeks back when i was uh taking all these seeds out of the fruits like you remember a couple weeks back i put a whole bunch of pomegranate seeds on a napkin a whole bunch of these candy it was called cantaloupe but it was from the candy company and they tasted sweet as [ __ ] and i got some tangerines that was from peru um and i took some seeds off of those now the pomegranates i don't see not one viable seed and i put so many in there too um and also like uh i put a lot in there so it should be at least one that germinated but since none germinated and i put these in the napkins like i'll say about a week ago so that should give them plenty of time to germinate i don't know if pomegranates take a long time to germinate or what imma give them a few more days because pomegranates are are a tree so tree seeds might take a little bit longer than regular seeds like these tangerines this is a tree as well and they haven't germinated these haven't germinated but these cantaloupes on the other hand i see two right here that's gave me life that's giving me life i'm true but um nah matter of fact four one two three four yeah so i'mma let them do they think for a couple more days and once these uh marijuana seeds are done germinating i'm gonna plant these and these at the same time and these would be considered my round twos because you know i like to do round one plants and then whatever doesn't germinate i'll germinate another set and make round two so these are my round twos my round ones are already in the bedroom under my bloom plus a 3000 watt led and these will be in there in a few more days a chia wanna put your seeds in a dark place and look how dark it is in here um i just had some seeds in there so that's why it's all misty in there but i like to use this raiders uh cup and i name this the seed incubation chamber so basically after i wrap up all my seeds and put them all in their own individual baggies with the napkin in it then i like to wrap all that up in another bag and just make it into a neat little burrito and then after that you put it in there cover it up and then i like to turn it upside down because even though i haven't punctured this part yet um it might still be a little bit of light leak coming through there so i like to flip it upside down like that and then i put this right above my grow light not under it because you don't want any light to hit it but i put it on top of the grow light so um it stays hella hella warm up there i'm saying hella warm like when i took this out today when i took it out and felt this it was like [ __ ] damn near hot it was like hella lukewarm so i'll show y'all in a minute what i'm talking about so let me put this right up in there i'll be right back all right so like i said i like to put it on top of my grow light not under it so it could stay hot and at the same time not have light beaming on it i'm saying that's the grow light well this is my spider farmer this isn't my bloom plus it's my spider farmer but i will be changing this out soon as my other plants are ready for flower but yeah basically i just keep it up here and this is nice and hot up here nice and hot i can't even keep my hand on there too long because it's just that hot and that's that you know what i'm saying a chill what up youtube it's tuesday november 3rd 2020. this is officially week number five for your boy um pardon the lights being off right now um daylight saving time got the best of me and uh my grow timer it was set uh one hour ahead yeah i'm saying so i was looking at that clock the whole time just taking my time watering and [ __ ] and all of a sudden the lights cut off i was like oh what the [ __ ] so oh well i can't cut them back on because i'm not trying to stress my plants out and create unwanted seed just for me trying to review but i will use the light on my phone so without further ado let's get into the plants um a lot's been going on in here um hopefully uh my phone's flash should catch all the goodness that it should but really um i think the night vision will be a little bit better i'm saying because i'll be able to zoom in on the buds more and the light intensity won't be all on my back while i'm trying to get to these nugs so i can give you some good shots but i'm not going to be in here for long i'm already been overdue for the tent to be closed about a half hour um because like i said the lights cut off like mid way of me watering so i just had to finish it's not like you can stop midway so i just finished up and here's the update so without further ado as you can see my first auto is gone smoke so well so grade a probably the best again the best smoke i ever smoked and i think it was due to three factors one my uh my compost uh two you know i'm saying uh not over watering and [ __ ] like you know i usually do because like before i would like water it so much to see like you know some runoff but with that one i didn't water it as much and three you know i'm saying just leaving it alone and not [ __ ] with it every few days and man it grew up to be some of the best smoke i've ever smoked no lie all right so with that being said let's get into tent number one this is this is my blue gorilla final number one let's get into it everybody's looking lovely right now yeah i'm saying this is my thumb so we got a whole bunch of thumb nugs we got a whole bunch of thumbnails yeah i'm saying but it's only week five so wait till week six that's when everybody start bulking up you know what i'm saying oh yeah that night vision you could really see what's going on what did it do oh yeah you can see the trichomes way better really i should start doing night vision from now on but nah let's just keep doing it with the lights on doing it in the dark but how'd it go doing it in the park doing it after dark oh yeah you know what i'm saying the show leave still lime green that's okay as long as my buds fatten up the leaves they'll get cut off anyway oh look at them sugar leaves look at the sugar on them leaves and sorry for the shakiness you know how i had a fan do and speaking of fans on my next grow i'm gonna take this fan out and put another oscillating uh long fan like i got in tent number two so it'll give me more room to put a couple more of these air pots in because this stool right here holding my this fan i mean look i've been riding with this setup since the first time i bought my first tent like five years ago you know

comparison purposes hold on there will you damn near i know she rock solid rock solid let me see you remember when i told y'all last week that this is gonna be probably a quarter ounce nug and all the other ones that was gonna be a quarter ounce snug and all the other ones is gonna be eighths indeed so let's get into it real quick hold on let's zoom in you know i like to get close up close and personal ah it's not the right okay hold on because it's not the right light that i want there we go okay we can work with that she just so white it's hard to again it's hard to get that good shot because she's just so white there we go i think that's it we could work with that i guess i'm just gonna have to keep focusing it just to make it for you to see i'm getting better we are definitely getting better out of the last five years of growing i think this year has been my most improved year at all my years of growing all my other years i was just growing i wasn't even trying to advance or improve i was just synthetically growing and trying to get a harvest and on to the next one but now truck driving has really gave me time to just sit back and really study organic weed when i was in my truck when i was bored you know shut down for the night i used to look at uh organic weed videos and how to make compost teas and how to make compost and all that i never did that before before truck driving i never did that and i just really started researching how to grow organic weed and just that research alone was the motivation i needed to quit truck driving and to come back home and to put knowledge into action i'm saying so all right that's the pineapple round two enough for that let's move on to the blue gorilla fino seven see these nugs are a little bit easier to see because they not they're not glistening yet they not icy yet i'm saying they're not frosty but just give them a couple more weeks and i'm gonna have to keep zooming in on these too just like i did with that pineapple yeah i'm saying black friday i want to go stupid on seedsman.com i want to just go absolutely ridiculous and at least buy a hundred dollars worth of seeds yeah i'm saying half of my seeds that i buy is gonna be barney's farm i really don't need to uh buy any more seeds cause i have enough seeds to last me at least a couple years but i'm just addicted to buying seeds bro just to buy them and store them long term because you never know after this election you never know how shit's going to play out in the economy so you got to be stocked up with your food with your grow supplies with your seeds because you never know what's coming you know what i'm saying all right so let's move on from this one let's get to my blair witch i did get a clone of her and i am happy as [ __ ] because look at the [ __ ] growth on her blair witch right now she's probably about three and three quarters feet tall i'm saying i still don't know what she is i don't know what strange she is but when i smoke her we'll figure it out well i probably still won't even figure it out but i hope it's a scary high cause her name is blair witch hold on let me get to this uh all right this is the back of blair witch right here let's go down this so start from there go all the way down there go all the way down down down and down this is the middle part of her the mid part and let's bring her on up on the other side hold on she dancing right now you got to give her time to slow down all right that's blair witch this is another blue gorilla fino but the one i want to show y'all most is that one right there which is the new york diesel final number two looking righteous but this is the blue cookies fino whatever we're just gonna skim through this one so i could hurry up all right this one is my nyc diesel final number two oh my goodness she is like really maturing on me bro bro so she is really maturing on me bro all right that's that looking good and last but not least hold on let me shut this down this needs to be closed all right and last but not least let's get to the candy kush back here candy kush and i did get a clone of her and the clone of this candy kush is doing the best at all well besides the males the males are doing the best and then as far as the female clones the candy kush is doing the best at all my female clones all right that's candy crush let's uh close up shop and i'll take y'all to the sunflower room cheers all right and the sunflower room so the sunflowers are on day 60 something i'm not sure i gotta look it up i'll put it on the bottom of the video somewhere but yeah i know they're at least in day 60 something i've been uh pollinating them uh each one as you can tell and every time i do it i gotta wear a gas mask or some kind of like bandana because that pollen is thick boy let me give you an example you see all that pollen falling like snow and i'm saying you go from that one to this one and do the same thing see all that piling falling yep and you just keep doing that so here's the first one looking just right look at the back sunspot dwarf sunflower the second one looking nice nice and the one that's about to form all the seeds right now is this one because once sunflowers once their head tilts like that and it gets real heavy then that means all up in here all up in here is creating sunflowers once it gets heavy like this it is already hard all this is rock hard right now i'm saying once it's time to harvest your seeds you got to cut it from the head and just sprinkle all the seeds out the shell so the next step for this one because it's in that mature stage the next step for this one is for all the yellow leaves to die off and for that center core to turn black it's going to turn like pitch black and then after that it'll be ready yeah i'm saying and when it turns pitch black outside usually that's the point where all the like critters start taking the seeds out like all the squirrels they be taking the seeds out all the [ __ ] you know any any little critters all the birds and [ __ ] they start pecking at the sunflower so and that's that all right y'all like comment subscribe and stay tuned to between week six and nine it's gonna be nothing but bomb so you best stay tuned your boy las vegas nights we out hopefully y'all voted for whoever y'all wanted to be in office or stay in office or

after the prince song the beautiful ones and i'm saying because it's just one of the beautiful ones the beautiful ones will hurt you it retails you heard the beautiful ones we got a blunt from the role of it right now um yeah i was listening to that prince song just recently and i put two and two together like hold on this strain was like my most beautiful strain that i had last grow so why not

man so i had to throw in the wu tang shirt with the matching socks we're not really matching this is more of a gold than black and as we get down to schwein these are more of a blackened more of a black and yellow anyway like i say we made it y'all week one flower and also i just came from the mall today cuz y'all know i love my horror memorabilia and wow oh [ __ ] we got a grow room glare on the screen there we go wow you got your man ghost face i got you man i already been blessed enough from this last harvest when i show you the seed bank and how many seeds i got because i was wondering i was like why are the like why is the plant so small like why are most of my plants so small because it was creating seed for me i would much rather get seed than bud any day i'm saying like if a plant's going to give me 10 seeds with small buds i'll take that any day you know i'm saying but yeah i'll show you all the seed inventory like in future flower videos but for now let's cheers it up real quick oh yeah what we got in here is some of my new genetics inspired by method man it's a critical orange punch cross back with itself this is just critical orange punch but my new fino genetics is it's gonna be something good so cheers everybody critical orange punch number one ice cubes let me flip you all over so we can uh get blazed together matter of fact let me flip it all the way over i'll be right back all right that's a better view right there yes yes yes yes all right cheers oh my god oh man i feel it all right here oh [ __ ] it's too much hold on a second y'all like the longer you let your weak hear the bomber it is bro almost forgot i was still recording for a minute um but this is the front view well let me flip it over here so this is the front view of ghost face and

video game of all time good night and good luck out my special kush number one that's what this is and i think this is the last of it hold on i'm sorry if it's shaky it's my [ __ ] hand uh i need to get a better angle but as you can see we got a white grape rolled up just right and as you can see there's some healthy seeds so with special kush's special kush is afghan times kush but my genetics is special kush time special kush you know i'm saying and i mean it could have got pollinated by something else but i doubt it so i'ma just name this crystal lake right here inspired by jason it's just somewhere you don't want to be you feel me it's like once you there you there but you don't want to be there you feel me it's a good feeling but you don't want to be there you heard crystal lake yeah what up y'all so it's sunday august 27th damn near nine at night 86 degrees in my tent number one so i had to just open this up i was alarmed because you don't want to go past that 86 degree threshold that's danger get on the floor so i'm gonna get on the flow i just wanted to show y'all today because i have my scrog at exactly 30 inches which is two and a half feet two and a half feet i got tent number two scrog at two feet because this light is a little bit stronger well a lot stronger actually so but i just wanted to show y'all today is the first day that gorilla glue number four fino number one has officially reached the top of the [ __ ] scroll look at that she's just dancing right there at the top she touching it she dunking like shaq she said [ __ ] i'm growing what up y'all today is sunday september 27th and i just wanted to show y'all the progress of my virginia gold tobacco today is officially day number one we have it's dripping a little bit cause i just water all my plants so as you can see we have three baby seedlings one two and three they're just so small you could barely catch them when you're looking i had to really just stare at the soil for a minute in order to catch him like that but indeed we got three virginia gold heirloom tobacco seed yes sir i cannot wait to y'all mature so i can roll y'all up in some organic weed push up and that's the new one that's the over but anyway we made it to our destination which is did you guessed it cuban food cause i'm finna grub huh yes sir we used to call that [ __ ] procrastinating i don't know if that really goes with the definition but in high school like i said i grew up in atlanta so in atlanta like if you was on some fire [ __ ] everybody would congratulate you if you went to school with jordans and [ __ ] but if you went to school with anything less you would get roasted and toasted and burnt to a crisp like in my high school i don't know about charles but i grew up in a predominantly black high school because i grew up in east atlanta so that was atlanta period is nothing but black people you feel me but let me get out of here it's hot as [ __ ] but anyway um they called that procrastinating when you had on more than one name brand like if it was showing like i got the polo ralph lauren horse right there and i got the jordan like they'll call me procrastinating like [ __ ] you procrastinate if you got two name brands or some [ __ ] i don't know i was just thinking some high school [ __ ] oh yeah so i just got dinner winner winner chicken dinner but now it's the beef yeah i remember that old ass 90s commercial beef it's what's for dinner that was all they said in the commercial i had to get the shredded beef with the plantain with the white rice that's how some white folks say they say the white even uh steve harvey steve harvey he'd be saying white he put a he put a wth on it or why i tell you why is that white in that white meat yes here to you [Music] all right i'm about to go home and eat and smoke weed it is smoking it is smoking by the way look at that frost on it but as y'all could see i still got the seeds in their seed pod i'm about to break them out um i'm gonna name this strain right here imma name it to cal i know method man to cow that's what this is right here bro tacal t-i-c-a-l just like method man song you feel me nobody did method man justice out of all the hard years he don't put into being one of the four uh forefathers [Music] black and red what up y'all some i'm about to test out some of my cub scout cookie fino one um i'm so happy because she's produced so far three healthy looking seeds now my cub scout cookie seeds are different than other seeds because usually seeds have like they're real dark and tiger stripe my cub scout cookie fino it doesn't produce the tiger stripes on the seed it just produces a fat dark seed a fat dark shiny seed you feel me and that's the trait of uh cub scout cookies for sure yeah i just wanted to show y'all real quick i'm about to test it out right now you what up y'all so i'm uh breaking down my chocolate mint one of my chocolate mint oh geez and look at all the presents that it gave me it gave me about three six seven good seeds and that one on the end right there it's probably a dud but i got a good seven so yes sir my genetics line will be coming soon featuring these you again this is sunday september 27th i'm just keeping tracks of the dates for my uh my grove vlog you know what i'm saying but this scrog right here it's at two feet the one in ten one was at two and a half feet and it looks like my gorilla glue final number seven is really trying to reach for that top straw it's like [ __ ] hold on i'm gonna make it this gorilla glue phenol phenol number five is looking more and more like a bonsai tree every day and my afghan kush it's really coming along same with the candy kush i remember when they was just small little runt plants that just didn't want to grow i think they both damn near the same age as these gorilla glues but they were just stunning the first like couple weeks of their life that's why i had to keep them in that ceiling stage for like what like 21 days they was just stuck in the ceiling stage for like 21 days bro and i was about to give up on them and then they just finally started growing like more tops and [ __ ] and i was like damn that's the longest i ever had but that just got to show you you got to be patient as a grower you can't just rush it these [ __ ] take they sweet ass time except for the autos the autos they just flower whenever they feel like it my autos they're currently under a what is it a 18 6 light yeah 18 hours on six hours off and that's a veg light but from the looks of it it looks like they don't mind but it's only going to be for a couple more days before i flip the lights in the flower that's going to be october 1st so let me see how long that is that's about a couple days from now by that time i know this gorilla glue is going to reach that scrog by then and this one and possibly even this one but hopefully these start to just branch out because if not these are gonna reach the scrog before them and then once i start weaving them through the net and [ __ ] it might take some of the room from the other plants so i don't know but let me show you how the veggies tend to all right and this is the veg tent right here my kale is damn near 120 days old i had to get my footing right real quick but my care is like damn near 120 days old and let me flip the light real quick just so we can see a little better it's getting a little bigger same with the sunflowers they're starting to get a little bigger too this is the georgia southern color right here this is the other one the other sunflower so we get in there it's hard work being a grower but you feel me the benefits to me outweighs the labor and the time put into it so we'll just see where it goes from here peace what up y'all so today is a somewhat sad day michael let's get to my kill real quick so my kale's been riding it out with me for 116 days this kale plant is 116 days old from seed i've had it exactly a hundred and no 116 days yep i had this kale plant exactly 116 days and it's looking like her time here is just about done um i've been looking at her growth the past few days and she might just need a new uh pot like a transplant but i've had this plant for too long and it's time for it to go so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna harvest all these leaves um store them in the refrigerator and then i'm gonna eat them for my before work snack you know what i'm saying um she looks like she really wants to be transplanted but i just don't got time for it um so i'ma just harvest all of her i'm gonna use this stock plus her roots i'm gonna grind all that up into a nice a nice amendment you know i'm saying and i'm gonna use this pot and i'm also gonna use that pots soil because uh this georgia southern collard green it doesn't look like it's gonna make it so i'm gonna have to get rid of this too meanwhile my three sunflowers are just looking like they just loving life right now you know what i'm saying i'm not gonna get into detail on them until i do my update video but i just wanted to show y'all just this real quick so that i'll harvest that and eat that and grind up all that soil amend it with this and those two pots combined will will be the starting soil mix for my tobacco growing right there i'm saying so nothing never gets wasted it always gets reused repurposed feel me so michael she's looking a little sickly like i said i didn't had her for 116 days indoors so what are you gonna do you know i'm saying this is her new growth and has been stunted in this same position for about a good like five days now so i know it's either time for her to expire or get transplanted but imma go ahead and expire her though so alright peter the kale you did me well i had a lot of good harvest off of this kale as you could tell every one of these notches is a harvest that's where i cut a leaf so i didn't had one two three four five six seven eight and that's just on this side so it's probably another eight on the other side it's about 15 to 16 good mini harvest off of this cab so like i say we got to go rip kill blue collared kale hold on blue scotch curled kale rip and there it is y'all my kale i'm gonna leave it on the stem but i'm gonna leave it on the stock so it can stay fresh longer that's a little tip if you already know if you keep your vegetables fresh from the grocery store on the stem or on the stock it'll stay fresh longer like a whole a bunch of bananas if you keep it bunched together like that they'll stay fresh longer but uh yeah i just wanted to show my kale one more time before i throw it in the fridge damn i grew this indoors ain't that something look at that this is gonna be a nice meal right here yes sir peace what is this [Music] what up youtube this your boy las vegas nights today is tuesday october the 6th at 8 37 my plants cut off lights out at nine so i gotta hurry up and make this quick little uh flower update video and yes i did say flower because tent number one is officially all in flower and all confirmed females for show we do have one male one confirmed male but that's intent too and i already have a future breeding project lined up in my mind i'm saying i'm not going to tell y'all what strain it is but just know it is a classic that will definitely be a good genetic you know i'm saying to add to gorilla glue but with that being said let's get into here again today is day one of flower for all of this tent and for one plant intent two so tent two is a little more slower growth than tent one but let's get in there it's not really much to show it's just nothing but leaves but i i will show y'all the progress of the scrog and the growth but let's get into my pineapple express pheno number two no female number one i mean round two phenom1 so this is round two final one feel me she's in week number three of flower today is the first day of week three so she's coming along just nicely again an identical version of the last pineapple that grew in this same spot the only difference is is different companies um i believe these pineapples came from barney's farm my last grow those pineapples came from uh where they come from uh fast buds okay they came from a fast buds so let's get to some of these look at the trichomes only in week three and we already furry and frosty that water is just me uh spraying my plants down some growers frowned upon spraying your buds with water i on the other hand love to spray my buds down all the way up until harvest actually i'll [ __ ] spray my buds down the day before harvest believe it or not because the water is not going to do anything to your plant as long as for one your plant is healthy two you have proper air circulation and when i say when i say proper air circulation i don't just mean the the centrifugal fan that's what that's called the one that moves like that so this is the intake fan this is the exhaust fan and this is the centrifugal fan or centrifugal whatever the [ __ ] i'm saying oscillating moving fan so as long as you got those three fans and constant airflow then you could spray your buds down all the way up until harvest that's what i usually do i never had bud rot i never had mold from me spraying it down none of that all right let's just get to the plants real quick i mean it's not really much to see there's none but leaves um there's no buds but uh let's see so this is gorilla glue fino number one we'll just skim through them and look at that lollipop i did some last minute lollipops on them so they're all looking nice and healthy on the bottoms this one right here is gorilla glue xeno2 we're gonna have so many tops this round we hardly have any burnt tips you might see a couple here and there but for the most part is a sea of green i'm saying like i said this is vino number you know number two right here absolutely wonderful this one right here is gorilla glue final number three again this whole tent is in flower and this one right here is gorilla glue fino number let's see you know number four so gorilla glue four final four is this one right here oh we're gonna have so many tops and my math so i counted uh nine weeks from today and if everything goes right harvest day should be around december 8th yeah december 8th within that week sometime in the week of december 8th and i can't wait i'm saying that means if i harvest december 8th cure should take no more than what 14 days i'm talking about that's as far as like hanging it letting it dry air dry putting in the brown paper bag and all that and then i'll say about another week of just curing and i should be smoking on this by christmas day i'm saying the latest my birthday earliest christmas day we should be smoking on this right here that being said let me open this so we can get to these oh man christmas day crush me all right and this one right here is a hairy lemon i cannot wait to put some pollen on her so we can rename this something within the lemon family the show for sure i like how short it is how short and stout feel me she's just a strong short little plant i like it i'm saying and finally in this tent we'll get to the cactus in a minute finally we have new york city diesel fino one and she smells so gassy bro she smells way more gassy than gorilla glue believe it or not i keep telling y'all these short plants they be way more potent and they smell way more stronger and actually out of this whole room this plant right here is growing is looking the most lush green like compared to these this one looks way more lush green than the other ones so yeah i'm gonna have to definitely uh get some seed off of this try to pollinate one of these coldest yes i think that's a white hair you see it with my fingers looks like a white hair right there she isn't flower so white hairs galore come week two all right like i say not much to look at nothing but leaves right now let's look at my cactus so this this cactus right here i don't know if y'all remember but uh it was never this big on the top and that just goes to show you how much a plant enjoys how much a plant enjoys this environment from how fast and quick it grows in the short amount of time that has been here so yeah i'm thinking she's loving it in here and my red cactus my red moon grafted cactus oh yeah she loves it in here she's been riding with me for a minute since the summer time so yes sir all right let me hurry up and get the tent too and i'll be right back all right so before we get to tent two let's hurry up and do this tent because my lights just went out and i don't want to disturb that process so i had to just cut them back on and i got to reset my timer when we get done but so here is my vegetable lineup this right here they're all in uh around day 30ish i'm saying so they're all in their first month from seed and this is a georgia southern collard green and these three are my sunspot dwarf sunflowers let's just get into them real quick not really much to say except omg how did you do all this indoors i'm believing this is where the actual sunflower's head is going to come from right there that's why there's a whole bunch of activity going on right here right now because it just grew like it grew wide like this and then it just stopped growing so i'm believing it's starting to form something right here and then it's just gonna pop out like that sunflower head is gonna pop out it's so amazing this is my best growing one as you can see uh there's not too much biofilm going on with my sunflowers is more there's more hair action a whole bunch of hairiness but there is biofilm on the georgia southern collard green if you look on this one you see all that biofilm right here excellent and look at this collard green the size of my hand down there so same with that and they're growing so well because this is an organic grow it might look like a miracle grow type of grow cause it's growing that perfect but no indeed these are some [ __ ] organic plants and on that note let's move on to tent number two all right y'all so we intent two we only got about five minutes left before lights out um let's just start on this auto right here this is a pineapple express vino number two let's see yeah phenol number two this one is growing more bushy because i'm growing it in the seven gallon pot and i know a lot of y'all see me growing in a seven gallon pot i'm not actually using the whole seven gallons if i was to use all the seven gallons i think i only use about four gallons of the seven gallon pot if i already use if i were to fill this all the way up to the top with soil these plants would be you know what i'm saying but i just don't wanna that's just too much work you know what i'm saying i figure you keep them in the air pot you know you know four gallons worth of soil and a seven gallon air pot and they should grow like some six to seven gallon plants because of the air circulation from the air pot so let's get back to this uh pineapple right here one was more hairy this one is just growing more and it might be a glare because of the water that's why i'm kind of mad that i i'm filming now after i watered them i should have did it before but it's alright look at that cola right there and also let me show y'all the mail so this right here is my afghan kush and it is indeed a male let me show y'all it is a male because if you could see hold on if y'all can see there's nut sex starting to grow right here on the side and that's how you know as a male when you see ball sacks growing it's indeed a mess now this don't get me wrong now it's it's growing it's growing nice you know i'm saying it's going to be a a mini mail but indeed a male nonetheless and the afghan kushmel come on now anything crossed with afghan is going to be some top-notch flame so breeding project will commence with this i got an extra tent that i'm gonna reconstruct into the mail tent with no fan it's not gonna be no air flow no nothing i'm saying i know the i know the uh the gnats they're gonna have a field day in that mail room with no fan they just gonna be flying all around and [ __ ] but i have to not have a fan in there because when it gets a little older when i'm piling sacks start busting i don't need no cross contamination i want to be the only one that's pollinating these girls not this one all right so this right here is candy kush candy kush round one imma just skim through them boom boom this one right here is gorilla glue pheno7 this is fino six this is the only one that's in flower besides my otto in this whole tent so this is the only one that's in flower confirmed i seen the white hairs yesterday i don't see any on these so they might be a week behind but that's all right again uh pheno7 pheno6 this is i think nyc diesel yep fino number two this right here is a gorilla glue fino five the best growing one in my opinion it's just so healthy that i will indeed i didn't clone any of them and i'm not gonna clone but i will try to pollinate the hairs though and get seed instead because seed is so much better than the clone so let's get this last one back here this is a unknown let me uh let's see so it's almost nine o'clock oh all right so this one right here is unknown i don't know what it is again i told y'all the story of um i had it labeled but there was nothing growing and i had like five of them that just weren't growing that were in different pots and i just poured all that soil and amended it and just put it into different pots and then a couple days later a seed formed i don't know what it is like look how big the fan leaves are this plant has the biggest fan leaves out of my whole growth is as big as my hand look at that and is the youngest plant believe it or not this is like i think this plant is like in day like 30 ish or something like that a lot of other ones i think they're like closer to day 60 but um yeah this one is definitely growing i like some bomb and let me just get another fan leaf like look at that wow that's crazy all right y'all we done with this room like comment subscribe your boy las vegas nights out until week two peace oh yeah let me show y'all the status of the tobacco tobacco are also growing and looking well all right y'all i'm out please miss the polo polo swag we decided to switch it up to die switch it up did i yeah", "ICFczCzR8vI": "[Music] hey everyone Arielle Adams here from blog to watch please subscribe to our videos on YouTube and like this video if you find it useful this is a review of the gorilla fastback GT these are the first two versions of the fastback GT which are the Mirage here and this baby blue and orange Tim and the Bandit which is a black and rose gold tone this builds upon the original fastback with a couple of upgrades and it costs three hundred and fifty dollars more retail and so I have one of the original fastbacks here and I'm going to show you a couple the differences in a moment so gorilla is a Swiss watch brand that was co-founded by Octavio Garcia that used to work at Audemars Piguet for quite a while and I mentioned that because he's a very good designer and he's always been inspired by cars this is a controversial design in the sense that not everyone likes it but that's okay it's not meant to be that way it's inspired by 1960s and 70s American muscle cars in the name of the brand the name of the model everything is sort of inspired by that and today it's meant for people that liked the look of those American muscle cars as well as the people today that collect and restore them and that own a lot of the modern versions of those muscle cars so that's the niche of the brand and I think it does it quite well the one downside I would say of these launches is well again you might not like the style that's of course up to your personal tastes is the size it's they say 44 millimeters wide which it is without this relatively dramatic sort of structure here this is a guard for the crowd so the crown guard as well as the crown make it close to 49 millimeters so if you just have the case it's 44 but then with this it's it's over 48 and you can see that it's not it's not thin it's not super thick I guess it's proportional but again it is it is a larger watch so for me this is about the maximum I can go and I have relatively small wrists so if you have medium to large wrists it shouldn't be an issue I do like however how the design of the watch and how the strap integrates means that it wraps a the wrists and is very very comfortable so this has a good sort of all-day wear kind of feel the fast Bank GT does a couple of things new and the most important thing is the new movement so now they use rather than an 8000 series Japanese Miata it has finally a 9000 series which is just a little bit more modern and a little bit more high-performance so the specific movement in here is the Japanese Miata 9 0 s 5 and that movement is typifies by having actually a little bit hard to see here on the Bandit here and open display for the escapement so you can see right there on the dial through this structure it's not perfectly visible but there's a view of the regulation organ whereas here on the original model there was no window I mean I guess I can move the time here you can see that there's no window there so this again older one uses the 8000 series movement so is it worth an upgrade for the new movement sure I mean if you already have them the old ones and you've been you don't feel like you need new colors or anything like that there's not necessarily a reason to upgrade the dial is nice and deep and I think they did you know always a good job this one I like a little bit more I find it legible and again this is sort of the Gulf oil colors now there's no official relationship with Gulf so they don't use the name but if you see the colors you're like look yep that's the sort of Gulf oil colors and I think that from a color perspective they did an excellent job another new thing is the display case back so now you can finally see the movement and looks pretty good here and again on the original fastback you just had this case back that had a gorilla which was fine I don't know some people thought it was kind of cheesy but it was ok but I definitely prefer being able to view the movement through the case back another difference is the strap which is much upgrade and you can see here that they use a a two-tone so there's two pieces of rubber there whereas the original one just had one piece I have to say the original strap was a little bit of a weak point and I knew that they were interested in upgrading and so you can see here on the Bandit there's also that two-tone so the strap definitely feels better so the new the fastback GT versus the fastback strap new movement there might be a couple of little changes here at other changes here and there but for the most part it seems the same oh another another difference is on the forged carbon case you can see here that there is a motif looks like carbon fiber which is funding a carbon fiber motif on a forged carbon case this ring right here that is an anodized aluminum ring that has a color and then there's a ceramic top bezel which here is in sort of a this powdered baby blue which is something a color you don't see very often a little bit more standard here with the black ceramic bezel and here you can see a slightly different kind of motif here on the carbon the forged carbon that is a horizontal line for the bandit watch as opposed to the slightly different one for the mirages put the Mirage went on I don't think I've done that yet again I really like this one it's not an everyday watch but it's something that I could wear on a regular basis and enjoy the colors and again if you're not into the colors don't get this watch if you do go ahead reading the time is straight forward hours minutes and seconds the hour hand is really a disc and so you there's actually a hand so it's easy to read but this entire disc moves which it's gimmicky but it's fun the minute hand is obviously pretty easy to see here because it's high contrast and the seconds hand is moving around which adds an additional sense of movement it didn't necessarily need a second hand but I like it a lot and again the proportions of the hands are all ideal and I think that comes from the fact that the person designed this watch knows proper watch design so again this is the gorilla fastback GT series and the first two again are the Bandit and the Mirage of course you can see the full review on a blog to watch price is 1150 dollars which again it's $350 more than the original fastback huge upgrade no worth the 350 it's a personal decision I think that it's the watch feels a little bit nicer you know you might be able to get one of the new straps and stick it on here and get a lot of the benefit especially if you're not necessarily interested in the new movement the new movement is going to be you know it's for Hertz this was three Hertz this is gonna be a little bit more accurate this is gonna be a little bit less accurate so if money is an issue I think the fastback GT is definitely the way to go but if you already have one of these nice watches and you sort of wear it as a fun piece and the specific movement doesn't matter to you then there's probably other watches in the future that gorilla is going to come out with if you are a fan of this interesting case and the whole theme again this is the gorilla fastback GT the Bandit the Mirage retail price is one thousand one hundred fifty dollars and you can see the full review on the watch watch [Music]", "q8ZrxDmpOsw": "what up youtube this your boy las vegas knights and we made it another week down another week to go uh this is day one of week number three most of my plants are in day number 15 of flower or what's that uh week three that's day number one in week three um we gonna make this uh short and simple today because uh i came home from work a little bit later than usual so i only got about a half hour left uh until lights out i'm saying so with that being said let's get into some of these girls now before we get into anything in here let's just get to this one first now i know i told y'all last week um i was gonna name this one like slender woman but i think i'm gonna change the name to blair witch you know i'm saying because it has that blair witch type of like stick look to it you know i'm saying you remember in the blair witch when they had the little stick figure the stick figures hanging from the trees they looked it kind of like this though loki every time i look at it i'll be thinking of the blair witch project for some reason so the name for this is between slender woman and blair witch i don't know which one we gonna go with but she's getting real tall and lanky on me bro and i like it i'm thinking mainly is because i didn't have time to lst her or do anything to her really you know i'm saying i just threw her in the soil and just let her grow so i'm thinking that most of my plants would have been this tall if i didn't lstm and [ __ ] you know i'm saying but that's what's up though look at that let's get into it real quick and by the way hold on let's just get into her real quick and uh keep talking to y'all look she's getting so tall and sorry about this stuff this is just this catches all the gnats and [ __ ] but you gotta have one of those but she's getting so tall that she's down there touching electrical lights and [ __ ] that's how you know she's loving it up in here i got a clone of her but i don't know if the clone's gonna survive like some of my female clones i mean it's different when you grow organic i'm saying everything with organic is like so much more how can i say this you got to put in so much more effort so much more effort to grow organics versus synthetics when i was doing my clones growing synthetically um it was just like night and day you know i'm saying like i would have roots within like what 10 to 15 days with no no problems and [ __ ] now since i'm growing organically the leaves they're starting to turn yellow on me and it's looking like it's dying up in the clone dome so and i think that's from lack of nutrients cause like i would feed my clones like every few days i'll dip them in some solution but i don't have any solution to dip them in now since i'm grown organically it's just straight water that they're getting dipped into so i don't know if that's gonna have a factor but we'll see anyway that one right there is between blair witch and slender woman we'll figure her out this is part of her this is part of her and this right here is part of her yeah i'm saying bad fat fat all right let's move on to our pineapple express fino number two auto um my autos are in week number five right now yeah they're always gonna be two weeks ahead so my idols are in week five right now um let me get some better angles and by the way my grow room smells like straight doo doo right now because uh i got my compost going and my gosh i got a little bit on my finger and my fingers smell like straight all right so let's zoom into some of these uh pineapple express fino number two nugs looking tasty sorry i didn't give y'all a proper intro but uh like i said i had to stay at work just a little bit longer than usual today some low key kind of burnt out need to smoke something that's what i'm gonna do right after this dammit can we please get a good shot oh no it's probably because i sprayed water on it that's what i'm thinking it's too late to try to pollinate this one um and i'm reaching that threshold to pollinate the other ones if i want to i better do it uh within week three because after week three you know you really don't want to pollinate you don't want to start pollinating if you didn't start already i'm saying because you need at least a good five to six weeks to let them seeds mature so i'll say like any time in week three it'll be perfect to start pollinating your buds speaking of pollinating let's move on speaking of pollinating um my my herme um blue gorilla um i don't know i just don't know about it right now like i mean the pollen sacks they're getting there but they're not busting like i want them to i know if it was a full true male they would have busted by now but since it's a herme is trying to grow both bud and pollen sacks at the same time so it's a little bit slower to give us that good uh piling we need but in a minute i'm about to just bust them open myself just like force bust them open and then chop down the point cause i'm getting tired of having to hurt me on deck it just don't feel right i wanted to hurry up so i can get it in and get it this one right here is our candy kush she's growing phenomenal all back here by she's gonna give herself some nice nice development back there all right and another thing i noticed is that um some of the blue gorilla leaves are starting to yellow out so i had to give them an emergency [ __ ] compost feed so let me show y'all [Music] so under this layer of napkins right here that's compost that i just put down uh yesterday and i watered it in and these napkins are just to keep the compost nice and warm and to keep it a block from that [ __ ] uh from that light so that's what the napkins are for so hopefully this compost will give them some more bright color really i don't care about the color now because we're in flowers so i'm more concerned with bud development than color so they could lime green out on me long as them buds get nice and fat is worse than tent number two this is ten i mean it's worse than ten one i started off in ten two and then we'll move on to ten one all right this is blue cookies i mean not blue cookies uh blue gorilla my blue gorilla og right here i know it's hard to pinpoint one plant from the other but all this right here is uh female number seven right here and also we have more goodies on the way hopefully i have a company that reached out to me well i had a couple companies reach out to me but i'm real picky and specific when it comes to sponsorships and all that [ __ ] so let's see let me open this side so yeah i had a company reach out to me hold on put my magnet on here all right that keeps it right here so it's not in the way but yeah like i said i had a company reach out to me um with a light sponsorship and i accepted the last company i declined because they're too well known and everybody is sponsored by them and y'all should know by now um who it is i'm not going to say their name i don't want to put them on blast but you know i'm saying um all i got to say is it's part of a solar system planet is one of the planets and anyway they reached out to me i declined because i don't want to just be another grower growing for that company but another company hit me up and they're more like low end they're not like on the higher end they're more low end not known like that and that's exactly what i'm looking for because i want to be the start of something great i don't want to be a part of something that's already great i want to be the start of it so just stick with las vegas nights and you'll see exactly what i'm talking about in future weeks um yes yes and i'll get into more detail when i get into tent number one i'll talk a little bit more about it i won't give the company name but just talk a little bit more about it this right here is our nyc diesel uh pheno number two oh my goodness looking just right come on now we only in week three right here y'all look at look at this the nug development on some of these girls this show for shop reach out and touch somebody's head you know what i'm saying it just make you want to reach out and touch somebody make this world a better place if you can i want to hit that high note for y'all y'all don't y'all ain't ready for my high note and last but not least in this tent right cheer is yeah damn it can't get to too much and obviously my phone wants to cut off on me for no reason all right this one is our blue gorilla fino 6 right here again i'm not gonna get into too much detail i really don't like getting into detail on the buds until week four and after like any time after week four that's when i really start zooming in on nugs and getting all pretty like that you know i'm saying but it's only week three though so all right y'all let's move on to tent number one all right so before we get to tent one let's just get to tent number three real quick aka my veg tent because i forgot the lights from the the lights in this room always cut off first before all the other ones and look at my dwarf sunflowers bro look at this bro like this [ __ ] is low-key creepy though like it's creepy how it grew like this like how it grew because i was watching it grow from the seed and they was like they was looking like leaf the whole time in the past few days these heads just came out of nowhere bruh that's how like bro this [ __ ] is like mind boggling and this one right here is doing the best like is like you could really see the sunflower head formed on this one and it's heavy too it's like sunflowers are so amazing because they convert all their energy into making this head you know i'm saying marijuana they convert all their energy into making bud sunflowers convert all their energy into making just this one big ass [ __ ] head and it's crazy how plants operate like you got uh melon plants where they convert all their energy to make one big melon like watermelons [ __ ] cantaloupe they convert all that energy like it's just crazy the transfer of energy but um let me turn this to the side because it's really like turned sideways on when i first came into the grow room i thought like it was broke like i thought [ __ ] i thought it snapped or something because it's bent like this but actually it did that on his own like when i turned it to the side i was like oh [ __ ] is not broke it actually just turned like that what i'm saying ah i got a little bit of my [ __ ] sticky fly trap on that leaf not a lot but uh let me just zoom in one more time on the flower head [Music] wow what you got going on in there man that's tight right there bros this show all right my three and i love how they're dwarfed so they're [ __ ] they're about to be like this small as a mature ass sunflower instead of being like hella gigantic that's what's up this is exactly what i needed for this small tent and this right here is our georgia southern collard green i had to trim it on the bottom so it could start growing more on the top because uh it looked like it was trying to die on me but ever since i gave it a lollipop it just perked right back up collard greens all right let's get up and next let's get to tent number one all right y'all we intent number one as you can see the yellowing is crucial so i think i caught it just in time with a good compost fertilizer uh addition our amendment to the soil you know i'm saying look at that oh christmas tree oh christmas tree i wanna smoke some good let's just count some tops real quick our potential tops one two three four five six seven eight nine you get the point we in there this is the product of a proper scrog well mediocre scrog but proper lst and proper lollipopping and proper training you train your plants right and they'll produce for you yeah i'm saying but yeah like i was saying about that sponsor that sponsorship um because as you can see this is a spider farmer sf 4 000 watt led so each one of these blocks are a thousand watts one thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand and what i'm starting to notice is now when you looked in tent number two you notice that it's not as much yellowing out as intent one now i'm thinking is because of the wattage it's too intense bro i've been noticing that with a lot of my grows the the plants they'll just get up to a certain point and just stop growing because it's so intense the light is so intense they don't want to keep growing up i'm saying so again i reached out to this company they said they're gonna throw your boy two 3000 watt leds because i told him i need something in between 2000 watts and 4 000 watts because this is 4 000 watts and this is 2 000 watts see 1 000 2 000 so i told them i was like i need 3 000 watts 3 000 watts i think is the threshold that i've been looking for all this time now their lights they're dimmable these spider farmers i wish it was dimmable this is the older version the newer versions of the 4000 watt is dimmable so you could dim the light so it won't always be this intense and this bright that's another problem i'm having because it's just too bright bro so again this future company is going to throw your boy two of their 3000 watt leds that's dimmable and i'm excited for this we're gonna grow our next grow under those lights i'm saying the offspring of all the last season that i grew you know i'm saying and it's exciting bro we've been negotiating talking you know through email and it sounds good man it sounds real good so just stay tuned and you'll see what i'm talking about i'm saying and this one i just put in the archives and pull it out when needed so let's get in our pineapple express fino number one she is really maturing on me bro and i gotta hurry up cuz i only got 10 minutes till lights out ladies oh it's getting chunky on me this is how these will look in two more weeks and she's only she's still halfway so i plan on harvesting her between the middle of week eight to the middle of week nine sometime around there it's when she'll be harvested because i'm running out of medicine you know what i'm saying i'm down to my last [ __ ] eighth literally down to my last eighth of medicine i've been smoking uh out of this last cuz it's been smoking so fire bruh i'm talking about rolling up three four five blunts a day of some of the goody good hurt all right so let's move on this one right here is our blue gorilla fino one and that's the final two so we're just gonna get a quick sky view this is fino one not much to see here not much to see let's just wait till next week you know three getting hello three though i ain't even getting no clone if you know three i'm hot that is i think fino four right here final four is like the most mature this is the one i got clones of right here i should have got a clone of this one too oh well this right here is our hairy lemon this is and this right here is nyc diesel vino number one i can't wait to smoke nyc diesel boy look at that all right y'all we done with tent number one um cactus is looking good they over there in the cut chilling we'll get to them next week all right y'all tent one is a wrap let's get to our hermi slash mail slash clone slash seedling tent all right all right y'all so this is tent number four aka male herme clone and seedling tent it all happens in here now speaking of clones and seedlings i already have some seedlings uh germinating right now because i like to start my seedlings while i like to start my seeds right around week three of flour for the previous grow i like to start my next grow right around week three that's when i like to start getting roots on clones uh germinating seeds oh that's a good time because it gives the plants about a good five to six weeks to get to the proper levels of growth before i uh transplant them but anyway this is our herme um not a lot of action because like i said uh is using most of his energy to make uh buds and pollen see if this was a true male then it would have been like pollen would have been everywhere by now but again hermes create bud and pollen sacks so it takes them a little longer for those pollen sacks to bust so i'm gonna give this about two to three more days if i don't see no action going on i'm gonna have to force bust them open and this is probably gonna be the last week of this hermes life you know i'm saying the last week because i can't i cannot risk uh cross-pollinating my girls in there i'm saying like week five six like i don't need that i need to go ahead and collect the piling and move on now let's get in here real quick [Music] um let's see let's see if we could see any pollen sacs that are visible to the naked eye oh here's some right here here's a cluster let me see where is that down right there okay here we go you see they look like they want a bus [Music] it's like two of them right there they look like they won a bust but they're just not busting yet let me get a couple more [Music] here we go here's some more there's some more right there and i'm just going to give them a little bit more time i'm saying some more right there so yeah they getting they swelling up on me not too much to look at right here again no fans on i tried not to water it heavy i just give it just a quick watering so no mildew will start and it's been been doing good i just can't wait personally i can't wait to collect this pollen so i could feed my compost all this soil and all this plant all right let's move on to the clone dome chew all right and this is the clone dome right here now that's what i was talking about i was talking about yellowing leaves all these right here are males and these are females over here um i really don't want to open it because i just got done misting it down in here i don't want none of that moisture to escape right now so but um most of the males have already rooted they got like a couple roots coming out the females they haven't rooted yet they're taking a little longer the yellowing ones are the females like let me show you so from here on this way all these are females from here on that way all these are hermes and males now look how much more better the males slash hermes are doing first the females is crazy but we'll see [Music] all right y'all your boy las vegas knights you about to be up out

thousand seeds easily over a thousand if i got 500 just in this one pack right here but i pulled out these two packs right here because i'm having troubles germinating um because i'm trying to get some mint some collard greens and some strawberry but they're not wanting to germinate for some reason so since they're not wanting to germinate my plan is i'm a plant some dwarf sunflower i got another variety but these should be perfect for the grow room because it's a dwarf so it should be smaller than the average one i'm saying and another thing i forgot to show y'all um so this right

yield medication quality and the overall quality now i already smoked cream caramel special cushion lsd and so far creamed caramel and especially special kush special kush i'm gonna put special kush as far as all four of these that i smoked so far special kush is the number one that got me the highest followed by lsd followed by cream caramel and chocolate kush and really i'll put cream caramel and lsd on the same on the same scale because so i'll put special kush number one both of these two number three and sour diesel is gonna be the next one that i smoke right now in that's what this blunt is right here this is my tester blunt you feel me what up youtube it's sunday september 6 at midnight right now um just woke up you know i'm a vampire so i sleep during the day wake up around midnight stay up all night if i don't have to work but if i do have to work then i'll just be working at night but anyway sunday september 6 midnight we got our whole new lineup veggies looking awesome i don't see no burnt tips this time again we've learned from our mistakes from our first organic growth we learned what to do what not to do how much to feed and with that being said let's get into this garden so right here are a combination of my first round and second round plants some of the smaller ones like this one right here it was just born like yesterday just came out the soil but then other ones like these big mamas on the side that one that one and this one they got too big they were in in here in this little tray but they started uh overshadowing some of these other ones so i took them out and put them on the side let them grow solo on their own while all the smaller ones stay up in here now this right here i'm gonna name this series my gorilla glue run because the majority of my plants in here are gorilla glues from a gorilla glue uh plant you know what i'm saying well the seeds came from a gorilla glue from a couple years ago and i always thought they was gonna be all male seeds but my harvest before this last one blew my mind because i had two females and i never knew that any of those were females and i got hella gorilla glue seeds from that from that genetic move from that uh pheno and that pheno man that pheno is smoking that pheno is smoking so with that being said let's get up in the garden real quick uh let me get my hat real quick all right i had to get my hat so i can get down here with the plants and everything's all good so right here we have a gorilla glue looking marvelous run kind of awkward but that's okay she'll fix herself out no problem another gorilla glue this is an unknown um i gotta see because uh what happened was um i had some round i had like like four seeds up in these cubes like four different cubes that just weren't germinating so i took that soil and i amended it into all these plants and then a couple days later i seen like a seed while seeing a plant pop up from another plant like it was like a plant that started growing so i had to take that out and put it in his own home so this one right here is the only one that's unknown but i'll figure it out in flower just you know see uh which one it looks like and that should be which one it is all right this one right here is our this is a pineapple express it's not an auto this time it's just a regular photo period of pineapple express um next we got what is this uh i think this is another pineapple this one is hairy lemon hairy lemon this is a new york diesel this one is another gorilla glue this one is another new york diesel uh right here uh where am i at no i'm right here sorry about that this one right here is another new york diesel this one is a candy kush right here that's a candy kush this is another gorilla glue uh afghan kush this one is another gorilla glue another gorilla glue and another gorilla glue so add all these gorilla glues hopefully i get at least one male to start the pollination process um this is day one for my sunflowers the they're called sunspot dwarf sunflowers right here just now starting to pop out and also i have some wildflowers this is a mix of wildflowers right here i'm gonna use that for uh mulch and compost when i get big enough and my kale and also the cactus all right y'all just want to give you a quick update they're looking good looking great and i'm happy so peace to the next update what up y'all what a busy night busy night it's like one in the morning i just wanted to show y'all something real quick so i'm transplanting my sunflowers because they're getting uh they're only in day two and i want to show y'all how developed the roots are this is only day two right here look at that i don't want to lay her down because these roots are tender but look at look at that room these are only two days old crazy there we go this is how a pro do it with one hand ah amateur pro yeah [Music] i already got one done i gotta do these last ones right here i gotta hurry up all right ain't nobody doing it [Music] so fresh it's so clean clean we still got one more taco baby but y'all know where i'm at usps about to pick up my grow light for my vegetables so pretend number one flowers could have daylight two flowers have daylight my uh my mail tent is gonna i'm gonna put like four cfl bulbs in there in my vegetable tent i'm gonna put a 1 000 watt led that i'm gonna pick up right now but i'm so fresh so so fresh and so clean got the all red polos all black with the red polo man all ready with the black polo man y'all know what i said last time red and black polo scheme is my favorite color scheme or colorway so that being said let me hold on with that being said let me uh boy youtube paul load out boy well i'm saying loadout keeps my drinks cold all day in the heat for sure man all right let me pick up my led all right i appreciate it [Music] what up youtube so today is around uh i say week three ish today is like around week three ish for the majority of my plants well my marijuana plants anyway it's around week three ish um in veg i'll say about month one from seed because you got to give them that seven day seedling stage you can't count that as veg why at least i don't so um today was today today is september 10th and is officially transplant day i would have did it on saturday but uh this is one of my days off uh thursday so i'm gonna go ahead and take advantage and uh get the transplanted um again uh most of these are in uh week three of veg some of them are in that's well that's for the first round second round or like in between week one and a half the two of edge uh my sunflowers all the ones with the with the long round leaves all my sunflowers are like in day number fourish my georgia southern collard greens they're like around the same age as the sunflowers my kale she's like around day 100 from seed so she's just loving life need a close-up on yeah she's just loving life right now look at them leaves i'll touch the under part of them because i'm in the middle of getting my soil right but just look at that look at that biofilm you see that biofilm on it this kale leaf is damn near the size of my palm so i mean my hand so let's get in there now what i wanted to really show y'all is this right here let me pull her out well i'm not even gonna say her i'm gonna say him because from all my years of growing weed this is exactly how males look when they're in veg they have no let me give you a side comparison this right here is guaranteed a female you see all the side shoot action like you got this one that one you got all these side shoots this one on the other hand only makes one main stem it could be a female but more than likely this is going to be a male right here i'm saying it's growing tough like males do like real tough and sturdy and it's just grown into a long a long plant so this one right here more than likely is a male but the best part about it is it's a pineapple express smell imagine back crossing gorilla glue with pineapple express home that's like the best of both worlds man so las vegas nights this was un unsuspected but this will definitely be more than likely a breeding project on the side you feel me i'm probably gonna put this one in his own tent with no fan on just light because in vegas it's cool enough you don't need a fan and i don't want to blow around any pollen so i'm gonna just put this one in the grow room with just cfl lights only yeah i'm saying and just let it pollinate itself or just open up those pollen sacks and i'm gonna shake it around every day scrape the pollen from the bottom of the grow tent and start collecting it and then when most of my gorilla glues get mature enough i'm gonna start collecting that piling and giving it to them now my plan is to put this one into flour earlier than the other ones i'm gonna keep the rest of these in veg for like another couple weeks while i throw this one in the flower like probably tomorrow type [ __ ] i'ma transplant it into a two gallon pot like this one and i'm gonna put it in the flour so it could be ahead of the game when it comes to flower because i want this one to be bursting open pollen sex when these jizz start to go in the flower just so it won't [ __ ] up their whole growth pattern and then once this one um gives me enough pollen i'm gonna just kill it off like mid and mid flower i'm gonna kill it off so it doesn't uh cross pollinate any of these just so i can pollinate them all myself so that's las vegas nice plan y'all um this literally looks just like a male so i'm gonna put in a two gallon pot and we'll see what it do peace oh yeah and i'm gonna show y'all cause i got two pineapple expresses um i'm gonna show y'all the difference now move this one out the way now both of these are pineapple express but i believe this one is a female and this one is a male i could be wrong they're both the same genetics and also they're not autos like the last pineapple express these are uh photo period pineapple expresses so let's see what it do how latin oh yeah and also this is the last time that you'll see the grow room in this state because i'm gonna transplant them all and get it back to where it needs to be so let's just get a quick little skim of the room these are my young plants right here these are all the just a little bit older not too much older as you can see no burnt tips uh no nutrient burn no nutrient lockout i gave him some nitrogen boost um let's see as you can see right here it's brown right here it's brown right here and right here in the soil that's all nitrogen gave him a good nitrogen boost all of them loved it except for this gorilla glue right here i don't think she loved it that much she just got a couple little spots not too much because i learned from my last growth that less is more when it comes to fertilizing your plants so i gave them just a touch of nitrogen i just sprinkle i just barely pinched a little bit of nitrogen in each one of these containers not even a lot so that's what's up we in here we popping we green and let me show y'all the wildflower mix these are my wild flowers they really starting to grow up in here all right that's the wildflowers and also i put down nematodes so hopefully that kills off some of the nat larvae and some of the soil mites we'll see your boy las vegas nights transplant time all right so let me also show y'all tent number one's progress so this is tent number one hella dusty up in this [ __ ] hella dusty um so what i'm doing is sweeping up the rest of this dust to get it up out of here so when i turn on all these fans they don't blow it up you know i'm saying all my fans are off except for my window fan because uh all the soil is completely dry like like dusty dry i'm saying and this is exactly how i want it because uh if it's wet it'll attract more gnats and all that because i got a lot of organic matter in here so but i'm gonna what my plan is i'm gonna sweep all this up uh my soil's already amended and i'm saying just waiting to be transplanted and after that i'm gonna show y'all the before and after this is how it looks before and i'll show y'all after in about an hour when i get them all transplanted peace got my mycorrhizae right here great white just wanted to film my best performing plant right now one of my gorilla glue four phenos and you got them all legit you heard let's get the transplanted all right so gorilla glue force roots are damn near root down i was wondering why she was drinking so much every day that's the reason right there so let's definitely get her transplanted put some great white on some of them roots and then get the transplant out here way way way on cimarron if y'all stay in vegas y'all know cimarron is hella west you know anything past buffalo is west really anything past rainbow is just stupid west and then buffalo that's just [ __ ] west in cimarron that's like you know saying but anyway i had to come back to star nursery uh re-up on some earthworm castings and mulch because uh this is the only one that i know of that has the best deal for the bag that they have you feel me they got like a big ass [ __ ] bag for like what 10 bucks or something for the earthworm castings and the mulch so i'll get that here and then we got it we got it we got it truck driving skills boom so we'll get that here then i'll get my two gallon pots and i gotta re-up on some uh mycorrhizae some great white and some fly traps um so yeah we're here let's get it they got three and a half gallon and it's the five oh that's my cactus but look at my cactus grown up this is what it's gonna look like when it gets bigger it's gonna look like this wow that's crazy but look at these [Music] wow i might i might get this one bro this one looks crazy i might get it look at that i might get this this the best price i don't seen for the 20 quarts or ten dollars for eight quarts let me get this right here oh yeah all right so we got a little some some i got my earthworm castings because i already got like half of this bag full at the house so this is all this is just extra just so i won't have to go out and get none of this for years bro the only thing i gotta get now is like the cube soil but i'll get that probably another time probably that my next paycheck but for now earthworm castings got my mulch i got two i never knew they made yeah what is it the three gallon three point three and a half gallon buckets before i thought it was only five gallon buckets that's the only ones i've ever seen but [ __ ] a star nursery bucket oh i had to get two but i never knew they had uh this in there oh yeah and i got that i got a new addition to the grow room i need to stop buying plants this gonna be the last cactus i buy it just look so swag i had to buy it i had to buy that but i never knew they had these uh and star nursery because i've been lining my truck with like my trash bags all this time and i could have been lining it with this they give you these if you need it for your trunk all right y'all on my way to the hydro store yo what up y'all so i want to show y'all the newest addition to las vegas nights grow is this weird looking cactus right here i'm gonna try to get a close-up i sprayed it down um y'all should have seen the soil they had this in before i transplanted it this consists of uh some uh what is it some organic mulch earthworm castings and some premium soil amended together but y'all should have seen the soil they had it in before i transplanted it that [ __ ] was so [ __ ] dirt like desert dirt that type of dirt it was so dry when i sprayed it down like i sprayed it down for like five seconds straight the root ball and it was just absorbing all the water the whole time i was like wow that's crazy how dry this [ __ ] was but anyway she's in good hands now with las vegas nights because you know how i get down i will never let any plant go astray unless it goes astray on its own but anyway this is another moon cactus i got it today september the 10th 2020 just documenting it um it's another moon cactus it's just like my orange one but it's just a different design they're both moon cactuses but when i seen this one i was like i instantly had to have it bro like i love weird ass [ __ ] plants like this bro i like i love it i don't know why but uh yeah it's gonna be a nice addition to the grow room and these spikes are like fuzzy they're not even spikes it's just like a like a whole bunch of fuzzy balls stuck together this [ __ ] is weird but i love it though i love it alright let's get her in the grow room and she will love it yes she will yes sir mr polo ralph lauren swag i gotta run some errands so i just put these uh levi cargos fresh out of the dry cleaning you heard the tan levi cargos gasta had apollo man i was gonna wear i was gonna throw one uh at first i wasn't throwing these polo socks then i was thinking should i just throw these polo socks on but then we settled on these hurt fresh hey fresh yeah reberto just came from a reberto i'm saying about to do some laundry right up in yeah i never ever this is a fun fact for las vegas nights i never ever do laundry without having a blunt road like it's so traditional like if i were to come and do laundry without a blunt being rolled i would go crazy because that waiting time that that half hour wait i run straight to my car and get blazed you feel me then you i i know my car is [ __ ] dirty as [ __ ] right now work work life [ __ ] has you in the routine where you just do this then you go home go to work go home i need to start [ __ ] taking care of my car loki because i do have a free car wash that i need to use so i might use that i just want to show you how this roberto sparrito [Music] if you're in vegas you already know what time it is with roberta hunt you already know what time it is i don't like getting the uh getting meat on my breakfast burrito i just get potato see these are uh chopped up potatoes french fries damn near i get potatoes egg and cheese only because if you try to if you put bacon on it or some sausage they be throwing like damn near a pound of [ __ ] meat up in that [ __ ] so i say [ __ ] it i just i like getting a potato breakfast burrito with no meat this is only 569 bro and look how [ __ ] big this is this is like look how heavy this is it's so heavy is oh it's coming [ __ ] over my [ __ ] hand and [ __ ] i'm saying gotta have the [ __ ] secret sauce to go with it because the sauce oh who who know that saying the sauce makes it boss and i say the sauce makes it what up y'all today is sunday september the 13th and the majority of my plants are in well the round ones anyway are in day number uh 48 so they're just one day shy of uh seven weeks uh seven weeks alive right here yeah i'm saying dave uh 48 from seed right here for the round ones not around twos like uh that one that one i think this is around two those are in day let me see uh day 42 yeah so that's uh six weeks so they're just one week behind feel me then around threes i don't even know what week they're in i know they're young hella young but anyway looking good looking good i'm saying looking good to be in day number 48 right here from seed all right so as you can see we have some top dressing fertilizer my secret mix that i put into each one of the pots in tent one and ten two um is a three part mix that i put in here i put a half a half of what is it half a teaspoon of something another half or something else and another half of something else i wanted to just do one tablespoon which is a one and a half teaspoons but i just said [ __ ] it let me just do three teaspoons worth you know i'm saying of everything because i learned from last grow that less is more and i fertilize them way more last growth then i'm going to do this grow also each fertilizer i use i'm only going to use once that was a problem that i had last bro i was using the same uh fertilizers like more than once like twice or some [ __ ] so i was doubling up so my plan is i'm only giving them i gave them their nitrogen already so they won't receive any more nitrogen unless they start to look kind of weak then i'll give them just a tad bit more but when i transplant i don't like to add any more nitrogen because after i transplant a couple weeks after that it's flour and i don't want any nitrogen in the soil um i already gave them their calcium magnesium um what else so all they're really gonna need now is potassium and phosphorus i'm gonna wait until flour to give them those two those are the last two that i need to give them all right so let's get in here um as you can see um i started let's get into some of these notes let's get into some of these notes real quick a lot of notes a lot of things popping just a lot of things i'm saying um this is my setup right here but let's get into and then also i'm gonna be telling y'all about the cure results these are just the first two that i smoked um i smoked some of the cream caramel and a special kush oh my god the special kush literally knocked me out bro like i was so high i i haven't i haven't fell asleep purely from weed since high school days and this special kush i must have smoked it i was planning on watching a movie last night and i just i never made it it laid the smack down on my candy ass literally it just laid the smack down on me creamed caramel is not as strong as special kush but it's it's more of a tasty wonderful high special kush is more of just like like a extreme indica where you damn near almost get a headache cause you so damn high so special kush is is gonna be one of those one of those weeds that i have to grow back uh next next run special kush has to be in the lineup bro i'm saying it's like special kush is like a cousin to like uh og kush because it gave me the same effects that a lg cushion gave me just in a different variety so special kush a1 to be such a little plant it gave me such a punch all right so let's get into oh yeah that's what i was going to do i was going to show you all the notes for that so let's see i started i don't want to give off too much of my info but i started my compost tea at 7 00 a.m yesterday and the time right now is 6 57 so three minutes and this compost tea will be an officially 24 hour brew so compost tea consists of one cup well this is three gallons water let me move this out the way so my compost consists of three gallons water one cup mulch and one cup earthworm castings two tablespoons molasses and you'll get the same results as las vegas nights and temperatures should be between 76 to 86 degrees i had this around like 80 to 82 the whole brew as you can see so much culture so much bacteria so much going on in there the more bubbles you have the more culture and bacteria beneficial bacteria that's forming and my soil needs it right now so i'm gonna pour all this into my two gallon sprayer i'm uh i'm gonna uh filter out remaining mulch or earthworm castings as you can see right here that's my problem i've been having i don't use a filter usually i'll just pour all that in here and then like mid way of me spraying like if once i spray like a gallon's worth once it gets to the last gallon then it'll start getting backed up and clogged up and i hate that [ __ ] cause like every spray i gotta take off i gotta take off this filter head [ __ ] let me just show y'all real quick my routine so it'll get backed up with all kind of just all kind of nastiness so i have to take this off blow it out and take this part out take this part out blow that out and then blow in there and then just do that every watering so instead of being frustrated and doing that [ __ ] imma just use a filter to filter out all that guck so let me pour all that into here and feed them yes we're finally starting to get a clockwork type of routine going i'm saying with this whole organic thing hopefully i don't burn them because i did use three teaspoons worth of different fertilizers and amendments you know i'm saying so hopefully they don't get burned this is their first big feed their second feed i'm not gonna feed them to like week three of flower and then the last feed i'll probably if i feed them the last feed will be like week five flower and that'll be it all right y'all i'll be right back yo all right y'all before we get in the watering i just want to show y'all just the results like i say of some of these strains uh this one right here is the special kush i just pulled out a nug at each one special kush turned out wonderful magnificent one of my top five right now just because it's just awesome even though it grows relatively small the smoke just makes up for just absolutely wonderful absolutely her special kush cream caramel another one that's just wonderful the reason why i could smoke it right now when we're only in week one and a half a cure is because the the nugs are not like fat and dense enough to have to cure for like a whole month you know what i'm saying they're small enough nugs where about a couple weeks should do it then you could smoke without having to taste any kind of earthiness so i grew a total of 15 different phenols i'm only in the second final of testing so 2 or 15. so i still got 13 more to test out all right let me get back to my compost tea see a lot of folk on youtube be faking the phone you heard i said they be faking the fun they don't show you how to make a real west coast burrito baby yeah yeah so i'ma show you that real quick all you need is some sour cream some salsa and some hot sauce i already pre-whipped up the sour cream right here you got the sour cream you gotta put the top back on to the sauce not too much then you gotta add some tabasco you have to add tabasco just a little bit though not too much a couple drops to do and finally no burrito is complete without some chalulas hot sauce boom and that my friends is a las vegas night right there with a blunt of course your jeweler's loop cause you gotta know how your buds looking we out please oh hold on hold on before we go because i say we ain't gonna fake the [ __ ] we gonna uh you hear that crunch that's a real west coast burrito it got a crunch it can't be soft if it's soft that mean you had it in the microwave a real west coast burrito you don't put them in microwaves you put a west coast burrito in the oven only you gotta have that crunch i say it gotta have that crunch yeah i ain't gonna fake the funk with you hold on hold on i'm gonna show you better than i can tell you you heard that crunch whoop daddy that's a real west coast burrito right there that's a real west coast burrito right there you what up y'all so today is september the 14th um today is day number one of week seven um from seed i'll say about week four and veg because some of these girls really needed like a three to four week seedling stage i never i never knew a plant could go through that long of a seedling stage the longest i ever had was 10 days but some of these girls literally was like in a two to three week seedling stage but anyway today is uh officially uh week number seven the start of day one week seven the start of week seven for the majority of these girls from seed um today i fed them a compost tea which consisted of a cup of earthworm castings and a cup of mulch you know i'm saying blend it up real well with a little bit of molasses to feed that uh beneficial bacteria and um i gave uh most of them well i gave all of them their first uh lollipop since transplant i'm not gonna lst them yet because they're not big enough to be lst so i just lolly popped them so that could encourage more growth from the top and then i get lst later um like i say today is september the 14th i'm gonna throw all these girls in flower october the first one i'm gonna switch the lights october the first so i'm gonna give them another two weeks to really veg out and get adjusted that's that's what i didn't do last time i just threw them straight in the flower right after transplant and they were about these sizes so i didn't get a good yield because i didn't train them but these i'm gonna really train them uh good temperatures 77.9 in tent number two uh i'm gonna just glance at most of these uh plants real quick um so right here these are all my sunflowers all the ones with the big uh the big heads all four of these are sunflower these three are georgian georgia southern collards let me pull out a sunflower real quick that's my sunflower right there looking marvelous so happy she just looks so happy a baby sunflower seed it's called a sunspot sunflower put you back and this is a georgia southern collard green right here looking so healthy these right here this is my wildflower mix um with these my initial plan was to let them grow all the way and flour out you know i'm saying do all that and then i'll just chop them down and just sprinkle it into either this grow or my next grow as a good top dressing compost you know i'm saying so these are bred strictly to die strictly to feed them some natural nitrogen while they're in flour without actually having to give them nitrogen because that's one thing you don't want to do is give your plants some uh nitrogen fertilizer and flour because it it'll just throw off their their heart their uh hormones and you won't get as much of a yield if you got a lot of nitrogen in the soil so my plan is to use natural nitrogen from plants top dress it and let it get it that way i'm saying this is my kale right here she's literally beasting out like literally literally beasting out bro look at that biofilm right there look at that biofilm that's all natural biofilm and she is just getting so big bro just damn near as big as my hand and i'm six 6-2 i have a big head and she's as big as my palm feel me i wear a size 12. and she's damn near um like i said this is my gorilla glue run so the majority of these plants are gorilla glue minus these right here pineapple express nyc diesel again they received their first lollipop so if you see a lot of leaves debris under the plants that's their lollipop right there and it's just going to encourage more growth at a faster rate so this is another fino gorilla glue another one another one and that's a baby one all right so let's go to attempt number [Music] one all right we're in tent number one aka beast d10 [Music] so this is the one where i think it's going gonna be a male i'm not sure pineapple express i'm hoping is a male because if it is this looks like a strong phenol right here and how i lollipop is i cut all the bottom growth on the bottom and it promotes more growth on the top that's how i do it i don't know about everybody else this is another fino gorilla glue i don't know why her leaves are so droopy um i already it's probably because this soil is so so moist um and another thing i mastered is i mastered the art of watering i never knew watering in itself was an art you know i'm saying i mastered that [ __ ] to the point where there's no more runoff coming on the bottom it's all being soaked into the soil is the difference between pouring water in the soil when you pour just a cup of water in the soil like that sometimes it drains out the bottom but if you if you sprinkle if you spray with a garden hose that same amount of water if you spray it throughout the soil it will all soak into the soil and you won't have any runoff because it's less weight is less water weight being applied at one time you feel me so that's why i use a garden sprayer like this one i use a garden sprayer like this one right here no sand and just spray my plants down [Music] all right so this is another fino gorilla glue i'm saying gave her her first i'm saying lollipop and she's gonna bounce back and give me so many tops i could already tell one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve this one right here is the nyc diesel [Music] looking bomb excellent this is harry lemon hairy lemon and both of these are two more gorilla glue number four finos really i might rename it because well i don't know i'll just keep it gorilla glue because it's not crossed with nothing so i'll just keep it a gorilla glue yeah two more gorilla gluffinos this one and this one was the only one that's another sensitive feeder so i put her back here because she might turn out to be ugly you see how her leaves are more light than the other ones and also when i gave them their first fertilizer a couple days ago she was the only one that acted up and some of her bottom leaves started turning yellow so i guess she's a real sensitive feeder right here all right so i'll say in a couple more days when they recover from their lollipops i'm gonna tie down the branches should be strong enough for their first lst and i'ma just time that each end of the pot you know i'm saying boogeyman's watching over them while i'm gone when i go to work at night and everything should be all right boy las vegas knights this girl is gonna be bomb i could already tell yes sir and let's just get the temperatures and we're out temperatures for that room it's 81 degrees it's 11 a.m oh yeah i got some burritos in the oven all right y'all like comment subscribe i'm out peace oh [ __ ] i forgot to show you all the cactuses so before we go let's just get one shot of cactuses real quick this is [Music] this is my rider that's been with me for a minute now that's one of the moon cactuses oh my gosh this smells like straight gorilla glue oh it smells so bomb all right so this is one female and this is another moon cactus fino that [ __ ] looks crazy don't it straight crazy transplanted her and she's growing just right so both of these are two moon cactuses just different phenoes peace oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i gotta get it thank you my friend and they got the pink one i'm gonna get the phone on though i'm gonna get the phone one put in in green i'm gonna get the green phone", "jgu0VPkjoZc": "yeah dude he's looking good he's been waiting his whole life for that alright we're back guys back welcome Josh dude it's been a while since I've seen you you just had a baby's number two well you were just at Oshkosh and before that we had flight fest it's been a crazy month or two to say the least a lot of you guys probably remember right before flight fest we did a crazy little project with a 3d printed motor that was actually sent to us by a community member we'll put a link below to that video and you can check out the channel of the gentleman who designed the 3d printed motor right here awesome amazing 3d print and motor and we designed an interesting ultra light around the motor because we wanted to fly the 3d printer motor and put it to the test and we had success - it was really cool to see even a small motor be able to actually lift this huge high lift payload but you know what we didn't want to stop there cuz the awful it feels so good we had a short time to fly it yes we wanted to revisit it and what better way is to bring our favorite p80 motors back in the picture they seemed like they but always we are our high lift solution the p80 motor like Josh was talking about it's been a staple in our big projects for a long time now thank you to team motor they hooked us up with these p80 motors are actually agricultural motors so they're actually used for commercial purposes you've seen those motors on things such as like the giant mini race quad the chair plane what else the cozy COO yeah and what other staple all those projects have in common - is every single time that we've built a crazy project like that we have always been tempted to put our favorite little fuzzy stuffed monkey in there Coco man I you keep putting him out like that he hates my monkey so Coco for those guys that don't know is my childhood best friend we grew up together and he's a giant large stuffed monkey I think he's the cutest thing in the world other people have different opinions on that you know it's a cool monkey and we've tried to shove them in the cozy coop we try to put him on the chair plane this poor monkey is nothing and today the goal is we're going to get the thing air worthy again and fly it and we figured we might as well put something in there so might as well be a monkey he's always had this look on his face like I just got to get in the sky so we're gonna throw them in there and then that way in the future we can do more experiments with this ultralight because we'd like to keep this airframe around to do different crazy experiments so he understands I know this yet but we're gonna basically task him from taking off the 3d printed motor and actually designing a whole new motor instead of pushing it through the air it's gonna pull through the area and the cool thing is there's so many different ultra lights out there we're still not really breaking from scale because there's a lot of really cool ultra lights to have the motor like if you reach forward you get you get your arm cut off yeah so it's gonna look really cool it's and look really sketchy hopefully if this fly as well you'll see the future flight best maybe even dropping some candy so we're gonna let Anders get to work see if we can do anything to help them getting that new motor on there and we're gonna fly this this ultralight see if it still flies as good as it did the first time we tried it I do the ham thing you doing amping [Music] all right things have progressed rather quickly with this guy and Andres you've been a busy guy here's the old motor-mount we had a sweet 3d printer mount and now the motors on the opposite side so what do we got going on here much bigger motor much better prop we couldn't have as a pusher because the prop wouldn't fit so we need to make it track there right and have the prop in the front so I drew up this motor mount it's just kind of quarter-inch plywood so it's pretty thick is pretty sturdy it looks like it yeah dude and then the motor mount part is three layers of that thick that's not going anywhere yeah dude hopefully not I just drew this and AutoCAD match the airfoil shape so it's it's nice and tight it's hooked right here in the front on the leading edge of the wing this way and in the back you know two points of contact there hopefully should be pretty strong thrust angle there's actually a couple degrees of off dress angle you can probably see that from the side okay so hopefully that'll take care of like all this drag underneath and cocoa bean underneath making some weird flight tendencies but hopefully that'll come on man well nicely done thanks motor has been installed and so that leaves one thing to do now we have to attach the payload so Josh I know you've been wanting to send my monkey on a sketchy adventure for quite some time now this is Alex's monkey there are many like it but this one says this no there's not ever seen anybody else like Coco you're good so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna build a seat we can't just shuttle monkey in there we need to make this look scale so we're gonna make a Coco size seat maybe some rudder pedals maybe add some scale detail we're gonna shove Coco where he needs to sit and then once we do that I'm going to shove some raw foam we don't need to draw this out on CAD and I'm gonna use the actual frame itself to trace and make the pattern that we need once we have that we'll put it back on once we know where speed I will put rudder pedals on there we're basically gonna build this around this monkey so we're gonna get busy making Coco a comfortable chair with a nice safety harness so he wouldn't be harmed no monkeys are gonna be harmed during the making of this video unless josh has anything to do with it but we're gonna get busy and we're gonna go fly I think we're just gonna fly it out back here you know why not all right let's do it [Music] all right so things are coming along nicely here as you can see so as you can see KOCO has been harnessed in he has a full safety harness we even gave him a little stick there just hacked together a quick little stick because it you know he's gonna be in the plane he has to be able to fly it now we are just doing some of the final touches what are you guys working on right now we got to get a series there actually a parallel connector for the for the battery so we can get 12 cells of a imbalance where it is life so for those you guys that aren't familiar with like lithium polymer batteries the type of batteries that we use for the Hobby these two guys are both six cell and what they're doing is they're hooking up a harness that you can hook them together and actually use it as a 12-cell battery and what more cells generally do is give you more power I think with this giant monkey in the bottom it's gonna need all the power can get all right it all has been done in one day new motor new P I see new pilot in command yeah he's looking good he's been waiting his whole life for that thing how you guys feeling about it I'm not gonna lie to you I think I didn't like Coco before but now I love who's growing up really growing on me I think it's time from take the air I don't know if she got the ground like he's what 7 pounds she was a 7 pound gorilla he's a big he's a big boy yeah but I put everything in there it has some weight Anders has ammonium on this he's pretty much a building high I'm feeling I'm feeling pretty optimistic honestly hope you guys from 12 cell power now huge motor huge group the team owners have never failed other Stefan probably Stu do with this project for how you feel the chair motor the chair plane flew off that motor yeah the plane was pure Matt I'd feel good about this odor the highlight of my career but now Koko might be my second highlight here not even because I did anything but because get to watch it all right well I'm looking forward to it because I get to chase it with a quad I haven't flown a quad in a while so without further ado let's get in the air he's got more than enough power Ben so are we gonna be safe to stand here once your fly ash or or should I move he wants to go [Music] [Music] [Music] and by the way if you guys are curious about those crazy 360 shots you're seeing right now big thanks to inch to 360 they actually hooked us up with a couple of their Institute cans we've been having a ton of fun with them you guys want to find out more on those you can check the link below alright we're out of the turbulence she's doing a lot better now that we're out of that turbulence yeah you could knock by stream rail knock it out like on your right wing I think I think you could knock it out so that des is gonna be great I mean I see it in there need some surgery or just cut cut the other one off there you go I can envision 20 pounds of candy getting drop on kids thank you you know what we're gonna do a little pass yeah do a little pass yeah I love little pageant I don't move the Quicksilver the cocoa Quicksilver cocoa Quicksilver oh yeah this is ridiculous all right you know maybe we should shuffle because I don't know yeah let's shuffle and risk a shout out to the right tell big Alex I I got you outside do you guys like a pissy little errors keep them shuffling shuffle this way you go shuffling I love focus on our I'm still getting the shot by the way you go dude look at this guy he doesn't come back he'll run we're gonna bring it in here we just gotta get a photo stream come on you this way you're coming we're good here we go dude were like a mountain named final Beauty I'm gonna capture this on camera [Music] so may not have been the cosy coupe or the chair plane but Coco finally got in the air I gotta Josh I gotta give you credit because he was adamant about making the monkey fly and now that it's actually flown it all makes sense everything gets better what it goes one person or one mind to the other and I think this is worth li Yan actually this is a pretty solid platform yeah she had did a lot of the 3d design on the free print which by the way all of the brackets and all the stuff we use to make this plane are free plans so if you have a 3d printer you can print it out and Oersted the building chad is the design it's a great group project yeah and beautiful yes by the way if you guys noticed the cool crazy 360 shots in this video of Coco flying this crazy thing you can check the link below those are insta 360 cams

this before but i want to say it again huge thank you to everyone who's been enjoying this series means a lot to me i'm really enjoying having fun with it and just playing it too uh certainly not like the most popular series by any means i just check in the view count and all that but like you know what sometimes just gotta be okay with that because this is just something that i want to play and i'm having fun playing and that can be just as important let's go get some water so thank you to everyone who has been uh what is that what is this oh it's our chicken i got a water i have to water the chicken okay sorry got distracted by chicken we've all been there uh so i want to say yeah just thank you to everyone i also try to listen to feedback i did swap the screens around so now the main gameplay is down here that way it should be a little bit easier for you to keep up between my camera and what's going on here and hopefully it doesn't make things too weird in between uh in between potential cutscenes all right um here chicken time for water how is it oh dude it's water that does use my bottle okay well that's good to know oh do i get let me get my stylus out take any small animals to consume i did no damn it ass son of a [ __ ] fine it's fine it's fine all right so where we last left off we did go up and get a shortcut out at the um swamp area which allows us to get it's quick back to the jungle the jungle's got all kinds of good stuff so i think i want to do that and i also want to i'll mostly get all of that continue to make improvements around the house uh let's have a chicken breakfast just that but like we're gonna grill up on my rock salt and pepper seed rip never mind all right not chicken duck plenty spicy duck orange duck uh soy duck i don't know whatever so i want to continue to make improvements i had the option to make a bed earlier and i just didn't and i wonder if like how do i get that option back because i want to make us better beds so that we can get more rest when we actually go to bed at night how do i get that option back at least we're healed up we got food we got an okay amount of stamina i could use more find a better bed oh there we go oh let me do you have a [Music] hold on come with me for a second do you have a uh thing on you already you've got water a lot of vegetables and you have a box lunch okay so you won't starve should i leave which i am likely about to go do she's working on some stuff right now um [ __ ] carrying too much stuff yeah i only have i barely have any spots to do anything with anything actually you know what that'd be a good thing to look at if i wanted to improve the shelves what would i need logs which i have and rope which i don't have i think she's working on a rope none real okay i just need to go collect plants okay uh [Music] well i might as well just cook these up then or i'll have us [Music] i guess just make another box lunch do these go bad like everything else i want hold on the chicken mouse just just a small snack of some nice juicy mouse meat yum uh cook up mouse meat looks good i think baked field mouse meat and raspberries it was baked not mystery bake i did that one right it all right hold on to this uh maybe i should take i have one on me already don't they two box lunches that's plenty all right i'm gonna let you hold on to this chicken meat i also need to talk to you right about your feelings ah take that and that i'm gonna take this water and extra food with me along with my sharpened stick uh how are you doing if you checked the beach after storm oh yeah there was a tsunami last night i could go see if there's more stuff all right i'm going out um [Music] i should be back before dark pretty sure yeah i'll be back before dark good job chicken when do we get eggies okay to the jungle to get vines and to get i forgot i could start fishing i have not made a fishing rod yet i'm a fool uh i don't really need extra twigs yeah let's go for the hard stuff i think climbing up this way is the fastest way there i used to worry about how much stamina takes up just to climb up all these that's why i brought the extra box lunches with me just so that yeah actually i'm maybe i will just so that uh if i need to have a sit i can also remember i can drop down two levels and try to use that to save a little bit of stamina and then climb up here yeah oh there isn't like the other side of the um there's more of a swamp i haven't looked at so i could check out more swamp yup yup see already tired and we're just gonna sit for like an hour or two all right better not great but better yeah like looks like on the like right side should be a thing i kind of wonder if there's also that river prairie that i saw earlier maybe we should go look at that some more yeah i'm gonna focus on that there we go back in the jungle baby oh wait i can go up here to another exit just bring me to another part of the swamp it must right where's this go oh right yeah it's just another part of the swamp okay what's up this way yeah pop some guava got some fresh fruit might have some water in it for hydration purposes and that's it that's it okay it looks like you can go all the way around to another part of the swamp okay it doesn't look like i can go anything off to the left unless there's helpful well why do i push this log down if there's nothing here maybe there's some stuff to grab but i don't have yet or more vines i do need more vines and that's it i do like exploring another one oh gorilla hello oh please don't attack me it's a gorilla looking at it from so close gives me chills better not getting any closer i probably shouldn't gorillas will mess you up like no joke they will ruin your life and a that order can i kill a gorilla if i were to kill a gorilla would i get it's meat or furs what would kill a gorilla do for me outside of like you know make me feel really good about myself and my masculinity you know besides that important stuff some more logs i've got an okay monologues back i should push this up nope you keep pushing oh if i climb up this way is that let me go all the way up and around to the uh back to that swamp area oh nope something's up separate oh i guess i did i didn't need to push that because i can just use my boys drinks anything cool around here no okay well how do i i guess i just got that log there in case i never need to take amy with me i don't know why i would oh pineapple god pineapple's disgusting i'm at two percent sounds like i might be needing another sit soon but what's this way oh nanners i didn't get to take nanners last time i want to make a nice nanometer if i can combine bananas with bread fruit can i have banana toast that's how it works right okay so i can continue north from here or keep checking off to the east this should be the planes yeah you never said what time is it it looks late it's late uh-oh i told her i was gonna be back before dark and that was a lie whoops i bet the fish in here is real good though do i need to fish as much anymore now that i'm starting to make all these uh traps though i feel like those meats i've been getting have been super efficient oh here are potatoes and a deer i don't have a bow i have a tree vine can i i can i quickly make a bow and one one arrow i need a stick or nonstick must be a twig i probably need feathers and stuff too dang it oh dear meat is probably pretty good let's get this potato come here title oh it's a bundle of potatoes not just singular give me that i bet there's just like a meal i can make that's just like a classic like sticky potato you know it kind of took me a while to get over here am i going to be able to make it back in time to take it thank you without you know collapsing over dying or draining my health down to two percent oh get the potatoes there's a buggy in here ah snake [Music] frank are you okay i kind of want to see if i can grab the snake i would assume not but i kind of want to try take it okay so there's potatoes here what else is here there's a deer also important uh okay here's a twig a couple twigs oh yeah people are telling me that you can shake the trees if you tap it oh my god i've never done this you shake a [ __ ] shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it like anything nope you shake or shake a shake or shaker nothing okay that's good to know in case i need i don't know more twigs i guess oh no i said pick up the twigs at dingus she's gonna get mad at me and i'm gonna get no rest again oh this doesn't look like it looks like the area kind of ends here like i can't keep going north another section of the island let's go to all honking tree the mana tree protected by the gorilla deer this tree is huge oh and those branches have a nice shape i'll bet you i could build a tree a tree house oh touching the icon here allows you to build a tr what build tree house oh we can move out of a cave and go to a super nice house i want that oh oh my god i should not be as excited for this as i am and yet i am okay i want to build a house i need logs and ropes okay i think she's working on ropes i've got a fair amount of logs why oh do i transfer my furniture over from the cave i don't know if i maybe it's not worth continuing to build out the cave if i'm gonna get a freaking tree house man dude all right new goal we building a treehouse she's gonna be like where have you been it's so late i'm like jump for a second we're getting the house i know i'm so excited for that oh that's so cool okay yeah so you don't really go anywhere else in this area but you do get a tree house okay we getting logs we getting ropes baby i'ma give you the good life but i do need to get home before i pass out and die and then i need to transfer transfer her over here indented rock what is this oh can i use this make a new spear or a clay bowl what is this i'm excavating yes that's like it's not indented rock it's pottery cool it's like some sort of bowl maybe we can use this for cooking oh and i can do more cooking oh my god i know we're trapped in an island and we might die and life is kind of terrible but we're gonna get so domestic grab an extra potato all right i'm going back now i don't want to hi dear i also need to make a bell i can kill you and i'm tired again which means i should probably how late is it ah it's only like midnight you know whatever i have a set she needs to eat something she has to have dude so she'll be okay i'm low on my own stuff okay not more important than anything else i need to make sure i can get back in time which i think this is the way i do the extra locks my backpack is full that's fine i got a couple extra fruit i can eat i was trying to hold on to these potatoes um let's see one of my lunches plus 27. that's a little bit these twigs aren't as hard to find as a straight up logs we've got some logs if i find any more tree vines i'm gonna grab those this is for the tree house now it's like so worth it so not only do i need to have these things i also need to make sure i've got space my backpack to carry them with me to go back and bring it to where we're gonna build a treehouse grab a quick pineapple for a little bit extra food plus some water that's 13 that's not a whole lot of juice i want to get there though there's another log maybe i shouldn't carry so many logs now okay it's uh up this way then through the swamp and then i'm close to home i'll close ish the important thing is like because it seemed like there were multiple steps to building that uh tree house so if nothing else i need to make sure that when i go to build it it's like done in one step or at least livable in one step it's like oh you can't live here until you complete all five building steps because all five buildings will take a lot of time but that is our goal now i am excited to build a street house we're just going to collect stuff we're going to build a new home it's going to be exciting maybe we'll start finding a way to weave rugs or whatever um should i climb back or is it better just to wasn't it this isn't even the right direction what am i doing on juice low on water she's getting tired well then she can bring herself to sleep all right every single of these climbs is going to hurt sorry this is probably still the fastest way back though yeah there we go see we're getting there no problem and i got a bowl we said we could use that for cooking can i make soups or just let me boil like if that kind of boiled that we got all kinds of exciting things happening is my chicken okay it's almost morning i said i was gonna be back before dark she's gonna be mad right time's it it's almost it's almost 5 a.m maybe if i told her i was going to be gone for a while she'd be like oh okay and then she knows just to go to sleep and try to instead of trying to stay up for me so i can walk into the cave and then she lights the campfire and says where were you all night and i was like oh please baby i'm real tired in fact i'm gonna go get myself a drinkie of water before i even come back in because my bottles are also empty because i had i had to water the chicken and i want to get that secret shortcut hooked up though we may not need it anymore if we just end up in a treehouse whatever there we go i can at least fix that part of me did you make me rope or not i should grab some hold on come here breakfast oh damn it that's right crap hold on hey this rock is shaped like a bowl maybe we could use it for cooking or something we sure can it would be great for making soup boyle and steam have been added to cooking that's awesome i'm starving you starving do you want to go like nap for an hour uh oh my god uh this potato soup thing oh it actually actually takes water for my water bottles huh well i'm just gonna make what i know for now that's right i gave her all the meat steamed potatoes just some i don't know how do i steam blow okay i said like blowing up to keep inside that little circle freaky steamed potato freaky freaky isn't what i was going for but as long as we can eat it let's eat freaky steamed potato delicious oh i actually gave back a fair amount of water that's good hey i'm pretty tired i guess i'll go to sleep now yeah me too good night okay y'all we're gonna leave that episode off oh oh look at that we slept for like 30 minutes check out the wind and rain it looks like a typhoon i think we better wait for it to pass by oh i can't go outside can i is my chicken dead ah this wind is crazy walking out in this will wear me out big time better not overdo it okay you know what i we need like a good day to recruit and recover anyway so what i'll do is in between episodes i'll get us fed get us rested up and then we're gonna work on that tree house like new goal treehouse time because that rules that's gonna be so good i don't know why i'm so excited for that and yet i am as always thank you guys so very much

content gorilla 2.0 demo but before i get stuck into the demo what i wanted to tell you about that content gorilla is an amazing piece of software because it does two very important things saves you time saves you money so how it does that is you can take a youtube video put it into the software click a button and it will generate you a piece of written content for your blog your website or your business now if you're looking at a half hour to an hour long video you get anywhere from five thousand to ten thousand words of content and if you were to invest your time to make a 10 000 word blog post that would take hours upon hours if not longer and if you invest your money for a 10 000 word blog post the average price tag on that is around four hundred dollars a month so right up front content grail 2.0 is amazing at saving you time and money it gives you content that you can take from video repurpose into written word to use for your business so i'm going to show you around content gorilla you have your youtube open if you haven't and what we're going to be doing is we're going to go to your youtube first you want to get in here and you want to go to your youtube studio and if you don't have one of these set up the youtube channel youtube studio we can go over that in future videos but for right now i'm just going to show you how to get your video to written content and what this susses out to is roughly 30 minutes of video we'll do a decent bit of content for you so if you're speaking into the camera like i am you can actually talk a lot about a subject but it's hard to transcribe it so what content gorilla does for you is it can actually make it into usable content and you can edit it on the software itself for example i have a video here i just did a little while ago what i'm gonna do and what you're gonna do is when you go to your youtube video you're gonna click on these three dots get a share of a link now that you have copied that you're going to go over to content gorilla it should already be signed in and then you are going to paste that into the search terms and hit search now one of the best things about content guerrilla is you can have any of your videos and turn them into blog posts or other content for your website and that's great because it's your own content it's not copyrighted or if it is it's yours to use because you're the copyright older so what i you know there are various things you can do with this this will do it for any youtube video but in this particular instance i am speaking of just how to translate your own content on video into written content so now hit search and do that again and we have that here then you're going to click this blue button create post then as you can see here in the right hand side it took all of the content from that video and it put it into the written word now that is 27 minute video to give you an idea that came up to 5408 words which is a decent amount of pages for content so you can see that if you average a 10 to 30 minute video one more 20 to 30 minute video that you have a nice robust piece of written content for your site problem is not a problem but this is one of the functionalities of content gorilla it does not punctuate it if you can see here on the right hand side okay so what you're going to go do is you're going to go all the way down here first one we're going to do scroll all the way to the bottom correct grammar that doesn't vastly change your content but it changed it just enough so it reads well there should really be no changes then what we're going to do is scroll back up to the top and what you're going to do is you're going to add punctuation now this is not a perfect science by any stretch of the imagination but there's absolutely no punctuation in this at all and that will slow you down if you have to figure out where you want every piece of punctuation to be so it just makes life easier you're going to have this right here i'm going to do punctuation this will take you a minute to churn and as it's working you can see that lightened up a bit so you almost can't see it don't worry that's normal now i'm going to be taking you through once this is done we'll look at how to create paragraphs look at how to get some of the um's and us out of your written content meaning while i'm speaking into this video i may say um or ah or you guys and that is repeated throughout the written document which can be a pain in the butt so i'm going to show you how to get rid of those also now that has punctuation as you can see it's pretty spot-on you will have to edit that but that's not not a problem and now i'm going to hit create paragraphs and as you can see it just broke it up into paragraphs now this is just a rough guide of what it should look like you can make these paragraphs shorter and easier to read for your content or you can leave them as is as it broke it up for you so now what i'm going to go through is i'm going to look for um's i know i do it too let me find one for you i'll show you the example okay so see here we have an uh uh um what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go up to the top so you know you have some so if you look through scroll up to the top you're going to go to keyword settings here i'm going to click on this box and then it'll have a function that says replace keywords and once you do this couple times it'll pop them up for you but i'm going to put place replace uh with absolutely nothing all i do is actually just click on them replace with box and click replace then i'm going to do um and then click over this box again just to be thorough at that point there will no longer be in your document and if you have a website name that you want to look like your website name you can also fix that here for example training tutorial video for e-money peeps as you can see e-money peeps is spelled differently in the document because of just how it brought it in from the subtitles so what you're going to do is you're going to click copy okay go back up to this function is that in there you can see that's emoney one word peeps another word and i'll actually spell out it looks capital e capital m o n e y capital p e p s okay and then you're going to place it and if you look down here this is the part i picked it by the top so you can still see it on the screen what we're going to do is you're going to see this pay attention to this right here when i hit replace it's going to look like this so that's one of the other cool functions and i'll do that throughout the written document for you i'm going to click replace and see how that's now changed so that can look exactly like your website because sometimes this will say your website name and then i'll actually put the word dot and the word calm after it which is all fine and dandy but you you need it to look a certain way to be on your site so that it you know people visualize the title of your website every single time and the search engines pick it up so that's a little advance for right now oh another culprit gonna okay i always go up back to this in space and a replace it with nothing and i'm going to put them together because there's a very common term that's now used in the english language gonna go nna i want to replace it with going to and it's not acceptable not acceptable it's just ease of reading some people may be thrown off by ghana versus going to so it's just weird what people will be off put by so that's it for the editing functions you've created paragraphs i've gotten rid of ums and oz and like i said it's a crapshoot right here i mentioned lovethefluff.com it did it perfectly but it might have actually put that as dot com dot space cln so um another thing i suggest you get and then we'll look into is going to be grammarly because you see these right here and you can edit it here on the page you can also do that with content gorilla but it's good to have both just so you know and next thing like if you wanted to add an image it'll show you what your featured image is going to be you want to add images i would suggest that you add images after after after you get all this to your website then you copy this and then you're going to take this content and you're actually going to come over to google docs open a new tab go to the docs it's going to bring you to your document this is linked to your email you're going to hit a blank document right click and paste and take a moment copy the right thing folks let me do that again here we go let's try that one more time it'll populate that and just to give you an idea that was a 27 minute video that i pulled this out of 5400 or something words and that susses out to 10 pages so that's a pretty robust piece of content or any website especially related to your business because it's you speaking upon your passion your business your services your products so it's going to be very very very specific and do you a lot of good now i have this in a google doc for a couple of reasons and what we're gonna do is you can get um google docs will have a function where it'll tell you spelling errors but you can edit it here and then once you're done editing it here you'll take it to your website and put it on there transferring it from google docs or wherever else you added it onto your website is content we're going to go over in another video i'm going to hop back to content gorilla now we're back on content gorilla with your edited piece of content and what we're going to do is we're going to go over here i want to show you some more functions that you can do one of which is going to be add an image now to add an image what you're going to do is we're going to look at this editor right here and this is a what you see is what you get editor meaning everything is out in front of you where you can see it one we're concerned with is the picture this little picture in the upper right hand corner that is directly to the right of the chain icon or link icon you're going to click on this actually let me cancel on i'm going to go to yeah i am where i want to be in your document so don't leave your cursor up here what you want to do is bring it down here to where you want your image create a little space we're going to go back up we're going to click on this picture button we're going to grab the image you want it's going to open that right here and then you're just going to click open and it will actually put it right into the document so now you take this copy it bring it to your google docs or wherever you're editing it and hit paste we'll go back to the beginning and we'll see how that looks so as you can see the one i had before was a couple of paragraphs with no picture and now this renders with your picture already done so you don't have to copy and paste it on your website at some point yes we will be showing you exactly how to put images on your website but if you want an easy quick fix for images in your written content that's how to do it with content gorilla so the reason i showed you this is because not only does the search engines like written content it also likes to have everything broken up by photographs as well other images you know gifs regular photos and it would be photos that are congruent with what you are talking about not just random photos so that's a really really good way to get a little more search engine juice something of that nature and it just makes google happy so it's more on your side trying to get more people to your site okay so that is content gorilla a very very short very simple explanation of what you'll be doing with it like i said you can edit on the document like right here if you have another editing software it'll be running in the background and you can edit here or you can actually take it to a separate google doc to edit it which i would suggest you do take it to your own editor to edit it or more importantly if you're editing it here every once in a while what you want to do is you want to well actually what you want to do first is copy it and bring it to a separate document because this has the tendency to time you out after a certain point of time so if you go to refresh it or if you're working on it and then you come back to it the website content gorilla just like any other website will time you out for security purposes so what i want you to avoid is i want you to avoid having all your work lost so always keep a copy of it uh even in the email draft or in another place that's safe that's not on here i've only had it do it to me twice and it's because i took my darn sweet time with it and it just tied me out chances are that won't happen to you but just want to make you aware of that and like i said you can edit it here if you have another commercially available editing program and we'll mention those in a future video so that's content gorilla that's the basic functionality of content gorilla and how it can work for you to create any of your own youtube videos into written content blog posts articles or press releases for your website so now i'm hoping that you see the versatility functionality and true value of content gorilla 2.0 and how much time and how much money and effort it can save you in the long run it pays for itself many times over the first month you have it because if you're talking 400 per large blog post like 10 000 words or if you're talking hours upon hours of writing your own content to get a blog post that big this is an absolute no-brainer for sure thanks again for watching this content gorilla 2.0 demo again my name is celie clark from emoneypeeps.com i thank you for your time and

decent ideas other times whoa hey sorry man how are you guys doing good good busy week right lots lots in the hopper we maybe got a camping road trip coming up with you and i hopefully yeah is that is that two weeks from now or next week next weekend next next weekend yeah yeah christmas is like two weeks away that is ridiculous i can't believe that but i'm pretty excited to that's going to be the last video we're filming uh of the year so i'm excited forever yeah that's the last video we're ever filming together didn't you see that comment from the guy who told me i have to not hang out with you anymore yeah i just i couldn't sleep after that yeah that must have hurt your feelings real bad yeah it's gonna be our last trip of the year so that's uh i'm excited about that because that's gonna be a good trip uh we're meeting up with some other youtubers which is cool we'll keep that a surprise uh yeah how about you clint what do you you had a good week did you have a good week i can't speak i mean i had a pretty good week we uh we did a solid axle swap on a toyota pickup that ate up about three days of this week yeah it sounds like like it would yeah um so i think it was monday i posted on my instagram um this truck started the day at ifs and then it was a picture of the truck with the solid axle already hanging under it nice well you sent me that uh you sent me a picture of a bunch of like parts on the ground uh yeah you said ifs junk all the junk we cut off yeah yeah so yeah that was probably we probably spent at least 15 hours just with grinders cutting all the the stock off of that truck your your ability to swap axles is not i did my own solid axle swap on my truck probably i did it once and then i redid it to lower the truck um so and then this one so i'm i'm pretty well experienced with this at this point you said 15 hours of just grinding stuff off what would you expect a little time it takes you to swap an axle okay so three days just yeah um two of those days were probably 10 to 12 hour days but not even bad awesome that's uh probably more time than i've spent modding my jeep all year i don't know anything about solid axle swaps because every jeep or every off-road vehicle i've ever had which has been a jeep already had solid axles so uh what what exactly goes into a solid axle swap clint why don't you uh give me give me a quick rundown here of what all this entails because all i mean i know i know the end results yeah that's about it you know where you're going yeah i know where i'm going i don't know how to get there this is kind of usually how life goes for me first step is pretty much unbolting all of the ifs that you absolutely can um and then spending yeah many many hours with a grinder and then depending on and shooting slow motion grinding footage yes of course very important do not miss that step yeah you cannot miss that very important um and then yeah when that's all cut off you then have to put your hangers up we are doing uh we did a leaf spring solid axle setup um it's cheap and easy so you just put your uh hank you weld your hanger to the front um under the front cross member and then you need to drill or cut out two holes in your frame to mount the shackles and you've welded frame tubes there and it's essentially ready for a solid axle to be hung after that and how many solid axle swaps have you done he has to think about it this would be a pretty big thing for me if i swapped it out yeah i would definitely know about it and never forget about it that would be an unforgettable uh month um my own and most of my friends [Laughter] um i feel like every time we talk you're doing a solid axle swap not necessarily i'm always doing something big whether it's an engine swapper yeah occasionally an engine swap not a solid axle swap but yeah it's a lot of swapping going on in your garage yeah how about you know it how about that six by six swap have you thought about more about how yeah come on clean i have i have yeah so so wait before let me just qualify this by saying after last week's show when i suggested to clint that he do a six by six toyota pickup he messaged us and said thanks guys i've been researching six by six conversion parts all day so uh update clint how are how are we doing the 666 i think we're going to go with the toyota 6 runner yes yeah i love it i love it the six runner that's such a great name too because i don't think it's been done yet that's that's your road to a hundred thousand subs right there the six runner man you can still merchants everything in the dirt garage yeah so is this an official official announcement you're going to do a 4runner 6x6 conversion i don't want to make it official it's official boys i really want to do it it's official what do you use i mean i guess i haven't done any research and has your research led you to figure out what do you use for that pass-through axle because i think that's sort of the linchpin in the build right i wouldn't be doing a pass-through axle um i would have wait wait wait what's a pass-through axle when the driveline goes through the front axle and connects to the rear axle okay i know nothing about six by sixes except that they're awesome and they're what you need so what i would be kind of figured is i need a a second transfer case with two rear outputs um and they're staggered one is a lot higher than the rear one and the rear most axle is a has an offset third member so the drive lines can connect yeah yeah and i'm thinking oh and i'm thinking to use uh f land cruiser fj60 rear axle because it's already offset so they put some because i was trying to think like where would you get a pass through axle like that it would be i don't know what would be i i tried to research that and there's nothing that i could find that at least was somewhat affordable yeah well i think that's the kicker right you can probably have something made for you for that specifically yeah and i guess you wouldn't really have to worry about handling high horsepower either so it's not like the the stride man it's not here that has 7000 horsepower there's not a chance it would go fast i think go would be the objective a going period the fact that it drives will be that'll that's what's going on if it drives that's the that's the goal if it's drive and it's six-wheel drive yeah well i for one would love to see that i think yeah i'm on board and i think everyone wants to see it i just want to give a quick shout out to valleygirl00711 our number one uh uh fan here in uh the chat room for the last few weeks uh she said hi guys great content this week as usual but special mention to sean great footage was awesome thank you very much for the super chat thank you appreciate the support anyway uh this week has been nuts i am super tired we actually almost canceled this this show tonight because we're all so busy with kind of trying to wrap things up for the year and get a bunch of editing down i know myself i've got three three different videos on the go that i'm i'm editing that i'm trying to get done this week uh it's just crazy this year has been nuts eh yeah well in christmas season right where we're trying not to spend the entire holiday season filming and editing so to keep up with yeah my goal of one video a week every week i've got to throw a few in the hopper to take a break and i think a lot of people don't realize that you know things to take holidays you want to queue up a couple videos yeah it's crazy so it means working twice as much yeah we don't really you know as a if you're doing youtube as a job like we don't get holidays and if you if you take a break without uploading you get penalized by yeah by the algorithm by the youtube algorithm i don't think a lot of people know that either yeah so it's basically like you have to i'm doing i'm shooting two to three videos a week right now because i'm trying to be able to take you know three weeks to a month off for a break because i'm starting i've been doing at least one video a week every week since january and i'm starting to feel a little bit tired yeah i know the feeling [Laughter] i know it's it's a fun job but it's uh you're out wheeling on the weekend you're editing you're out wheeling you're editing yeah it's you're you're doing you know meetings with with for business stuff and it's it's just non-stop actual swap for three days yeah yeah i think yeah you know we were kind of just chatting about this before and and this year's you know i've been doing weekly uploads for two and a half years and and this last six months has been some of the most tiresome six months because you know just everything from from covid to just the unknown right and at the start of january i had six months planned out of what i was going to be doing so it alleviates a lot of that stress and pressure and trying to figure out what's next what video is coming casey i'm taking away your name tag because you said the bad word the bad word i keep forgetting just just got the show do you monetize you've lost your name tag it is gone sorry but you know and it's uh every week seems to be changing you know even just the last few weeks with how provincial policies have continued with travel restrictions and everything around that it just you make plans and then you gotta cancel plans and you gotta spend more effort trying to fill in those gaps and then you make new plans and they get cancelled again and so many plans i think that's why it's been so tiring the last six months or so without being able to really create a schedule and when you're trying to travel and arrange collabs and meet up with other people and you know just trying to coordinate multiple people to be in the same place at the same time there's a lot of a lot of time and effort and then it just all gets swapped around at the last minute so you know like next weekend we're i'm i was just just before this i was trying to figure out where we're going to go what we want to do because everything keeps changing the place that i was originally considering going isn't open because of the word we don't talk about and uh so now it's like oh where do we go right you lose your name tag again and so it's uh it's been really interesting i do really look forward to being able to make some some long plans um you know and yeah people are asking what everybody does for jobs and you know you guys do a lot more time with youtube but i work full-time as well so i have to coordinate vacation time and scheduling with with my teams and stuff like that so it doesn't make it easy to travel right now you said you had six months planned yeah i had that that's impressive man i can barely keep a week schedule you have to right i think you know for me to work for 40 hours a week at a day job plus do youtube plus side businesses and trying to have people go to a place where say we're renting a house and we need to make those plans way in advance um you know not every single week for six months was planned out but a lot of the weeks were where we were going to be who was traveling with me and things like that aggressive all right well yeah i'll give you your name i'm a nice guy but it's fun right it's a it's a hobby too so we got a super chat question from kyle uh he's asking new gladiator rubicon upgrade wheels and tires 35s or bumper and winch first i live in ca i'm going to assume that's california and not canada focus on over landing not crawling that's that's interesting i i would usually say that uh bumper and winch is pretty much the first upgrade on any off-road vehicle but um depending on where you're going i mean if you need the bigger tires to get over stuff then then you have a chance of getting stuck yeah so uh winch and bumper first always my opinion agreed boys all right i got a story to tell to go with this oh here we go story time oh freeze um saturday night um somebody posted one of our local 4x4 pages um at like one in the morning uh asking for help to get their jeep unstuck that was like 30 kilometers up a forest service road um and it was way out of service and it said they posted at one o'clock in the morning and it was clearly daylight when they took the photo um they've been there a while a rough day i talked to this guy and i was like hey we'll come stay we'll we'll come help you out at like 10 in the morning he's like awesome thank you um i go pick him up and it turns out that he walked 22 kilometers from where he got his jeep stuck to sell storage you oh man and this was a completely stuck um cherokee with no lockers i think it had like a two inch lift but no winch or nothing um and not only did he get stuck he ended up breaking uh front his front drive shaft blew up went in the process of this is how you learn these lessons though right yes and like we've all been there 30 feet in front of him there was a perfect tree that he could have winched himself out yeah if he had a winch or any means of recovering himself i mean he was out by himself like there was no one else in his jeep with him and he didn't have anyone out there with him period so he overall it wasn't a great uh situation to be in but it could have been a lot better if you had some way to self recover a winch is so important it is like that is the first thing anyone should do honestly it gets out of so many situations yeah um you know a a new rubicon anyways is gonna be extremely capable and is gonna get you in far more trouble than uh larger tires are gonna get you out of without a winch and uh you know even if you break something you can get through hard parts maybe in two-wheel drive or with a broken component with a winch right and uh that that's pretty much my essential and i think it's for me it's like if you want to come wheeling with us you need a winch on your rig you know that's just that's a requirement if nothing else you need eli disagrees um he's in the chat saying light bars first so uh [Laughter] he's good working like he's a little biased here maybe a little bit biased yeah and i think someone there said in chat said like a high lift or something like that i mean if you can't afford a winch that's maybe a second best but uh if you can't afford a winch after you've bought a four by four a brand new rubicon yeah uh yeah you can afford a winch if you're going out honestly you can't afford the tow out of the out of the the forest if you don't have a winch right so yeah yeah it was um uh john john chef john from our vlogs a few weeks ago is he's got a forerunner and and we're working on figuring out what mods we want to put on it so that you can come out with us and uh another rear axle number one what's that it's another he's uh he's getting some work done at epic right yeah we're getting a lift and some wheels and a winch and a winch bumper there's a lot of things you gotta change to make it um especially on a toyota jeep as far as components go we're getting it done he likes four runners i think it's a great looking rig i think i think four runners are a really nice vehicle and a little bit more street friendly with the ifs and he doesn't want to get into like crazy rock crawling and things like that that we would what's all about getting the the vehicle that it's getting it's all about getting the vehicle that uh does the thing that you want it to do right yeah so you can do the things you want to do right no and there's no perfect vehicle for every situation yeah we just got to make sure we put a kitchen in it so that he can cook for us when we're out yeah absolutely speaking of kitchens i was looking at that uh what's it i don't remember what it's called now the uh that the one you sent the thing the thing yeah um there's it's like a what was it called uh a truck cap yes for the gladiator it's called the smart cap i forget i forget who makes it but that thing looks awesome uh i looked it up because paul got a couple in at epic for some some people are putting them on their gladiators oh okay and uh i looked it up the rsi smart cap there it is somebody somebody put it in the chat thank you kyle uh rsi smart cap yeah i was looking at that and i haven't i've never really been a fan of those kind of truck caps but i the way they've done it it's kind of like a combination between a truck cap and those uh like what they always put on the australian trucks like that those big metal things that have the you can they have uh compartments in the side okay yeah yeah utility thing yeah yeah yeah it looks pretty cool it's really expensive but i was i was thinking i don't know what do you guys think that was good on my truck hello kitchen too for trucking yes yeah uh that that was cool and yeah that's why i sent you the the thing the truck cap thing the smart cap thing because it has a kitchen that you like pop up one of the windows on the side of the smart cap and it kind of that was pretty slick it's pretty slick i don't know it's pretty over landy but i was thinking it might be practical for some longer trips we just we need to build out a kitchen rig for chef john to drive yeah and just have it follow us we can have the hardcore rock shoppers and go anywhere we want yeah let's park it at the dirty and dangerous house when we need uh we need meals yeah no the uh if the guy everybody in chat and watching this go check out the arb one too which was pretty cool um we saw that i think it was just announced yeah i'm curious what people would think if they think that rsi smart cap would be a good idea or would look good on my truck or if it would it would totally like just ruin the entire vibe of my truck i don't know i think the challenge you've got with your truck is if you put something like that on that and then you've got the rooftop tent you're getting really tall well no taller no taller than a rooftop tent on a wrangler right well that's the thing that's that's the challenge right is i'm not sure how much i want all that weight up there all the time it's really going to change the dynamics of how the vehicle articulates well i already have the tent weight so we're only talking about the difference in weight between a bed rack and the the cap right which i assume there's definitely more weight but still like i don't think it's that much more that it's going to be significant as far as wheeling and so then would that give you a fully enclosed space over your truck bed so it's fully enclosed and lockable it gives you a compartment on either side for storage that you can put stuff in so instead of mounting it on the outside you can just put it in a compartment and then yeah you've got and plus it's about its body height so it's a little bit higher than what i have now so i'd have i'd have secure storage for some of the longer trips i'm planning to do next year with the fam you know we can keep our suitcases and stuff in there right and then we can put the tent on top of that i think that's a good it's a pretty good solution it's a very expensive solution so those uh those smart caps cost five grand plus yeah accessories yeah so it's not exactly you know it's it's what would be cool is that they had one with an integrated rooftop tent in the top six inches of it yeah that would be really cool so then you just add the entire cap to your bed and then you get a pop-up rooftop tent as part of that yeah or some kind of camper conversion right yeah i want to see that for somebody out there he's trying to make what yeah yeah i don't know when you say it's five grand i'm thinking that's more than my entire truck cost how many solid axle swaps well it's like three grand for a solid axle swap like all said and done so so what is that that's the donor vehicle cost uh no so you can pick up those toyota axles for like 250 bucks um and then the kit itself comes with the leaf springs the hangers the differential rebuild kit your wheel bearings all your seals um the high steer kit so it moves your steering above the leaf springs and steering stabilizer and yeah everything shock hoops um yeah so so you're buying an axle and then a pre-made kit and then welding it together and then welding it together yeah okay who makes that kit trail gear trailer there's a few companies that make kits too you should get trail gear as a sponsor because they make all the type of stuff customers i've been i've been trying i've spent so much money on trail gear's website it's ridiculous yeah the problem is you're like exactly their target market i know if they sponsored me because i got to buy the person anyways but the thing is exactly their target market is also your audience i know they should be sponsoring you if anyone from trail gear sees this you should be sponsoring dirt garage who who else does this toyota stuff like old toyota truck stuff you know that's oh yeah not very much in fact it might be affecting their bottom line too much if they uh if you stop buying from them he has done a lot of solid axle swaps yeah yeah yeah yeah cool yeah asking questions about your new rhino rack my new rhino rack what's the question is the rooftop tent going on it no the the rhino rack is over top of the cab if i put the rooftop tent there it would make it extremely high up uh the rhino rack is gonna be for for gear just uh saving some space in in the truck bed i can throw uh tents and stuff up there maybe some uh i'm gonna get some of those cargo bins or whatever that you can put stuff in so yeah so i was gonna ask if you're gonna buy some uh what uh storage should probably get like a couple of front runner wolf pack boxes or something like that and uh yeah and they have mounts for for stuff like that and i might throw my max tracks up there as well and get them off of the that'd be pretty slick the side mount because the the yakima rack that i have back there is really poorly designed and so their traction board mount the way it sits uh they rub on the bed and it's scraping the paint off my truck bed so oh really thanks yakima your stuff sucks [Laughter] yeah oops that's okay i don't like their stuff anyway so can you put a a light bar on the front of that rhino rack oh you could but it's kind of um so a couple of feet back from the windshield so i don't think it would be an optimal place to put a light bar yeah i've seen someone someone on like the jails and stuff they put a rack over top of the hard top where the freedom panels aren't and then people are putting light bars on that so they're essentially over the middle roll bar where the light would be and i always wondered like how effective but then your sharp cutoff right yeah because you you got to cut off so it's not going to be effective at all it's going to shine light up in the trees which yeah just up in the sky yeah that's not very useful i've i've already got a light bar inside the cab i've got that quadritec stealth light bar um and i've got lights on my bumper so i don't really need any lights on the rack what i am going to do and what the uh the rhino-rack pioneer tray allows for is it has kind of conduits for wiring inside so i'm going to put some lights on either side for for camp lights so you can light up your campsite yeah and then they've got it set up so you can run the wall you basically can't see any wiring because it runs inside the rack so i think that's a pretty nice setup yeah that was something i was thinking about with the gobi rack was doing lights down the sides of it so that when you pull up and park somewhere and you're setting up camp you could illuminate the whole camp with lights that are seven feet in the air and yeah wide wide beam pattern and things like that i'm going to be working a lot more i'm going to be redoing my whole lighting setup really so and my whole power setup really in my truck i've got a lot of stuff i'm working on um are you talking about that yet or is that still i'm talking about everything but i just wanted to mention real quick for anyone who doesn't know what i'm talking about in regards to the rhino rhino-rack we just installed the new rhino-rack backbone system for the gladiator which is something they showed at sema last year and just finally came out recently and we got the first one in canada uh we just installed it so shout out rhino rack for sending that over to me and uh it's uh it's a pretty nice setup uh you'll see it obviously in a future video so with that the other the rhino rocks on the jails and stuff they have an interior brace so does that fall braced as well yeah it's the same setup as as what you do in the jail there's like a couple of brackets that go near the back of the hardtop by the roll bar and support it on the inside and then there's you there is holes you have to drill in the hard top to mount it to the roll bar but it's load bearing so you can get up there and stand on it and it's and it's rock solid it's pretty nice i'm i'm pretty excited about it because i've wanted a kind of platform over the cab for a while and now i have what i think is probably the the best one out there yeah they seem really popular with the jls uh for mounting rooftop tents so yeah lots of weight capacity right yep absolutely so yeah i'm still figuring out exactly what i'm going to do there but uh pretty cool add-on um some beer money in chat here from beer money thank you up north adventure with the beer money cheers to you my friend uh always much appreciated the uh sparkling waters always with the sparkling waters never ending how many sparkling waters did you drink and for anybody that hasn't seen adventure burger that's a high quality high quality movie right there yes that's still on my uh award it's an award losing film so that's awesome how many times has your daughter watched adventure i don't know she really likes it though we had a lot of fun making that we should uh you know we should do another one next year at some point yeah adventure hot dogs adventure hot dogs chicken burgers too return of the bacon um should we uh pick up a couple questions from the chat here say hi to our our chat room people sure yeah i haven't uh been doing a very good job at tracking questions here tonight but yeah somebody asked if i thought the uh if i thought the truck would be top heavy if i did the smart cap within the rooftop tent on top but i don't i don't think you'd be that much weight difference yeah i think i think you just constantly have to think about where you're going what you're doing and what makes most sense right and yeah and you know as i think about adding a rooftop tent to the jl it's sort of like wait well i'm definitely reducing you're going to go camping what you're going to go camping i ordered a new sleeping bag i am hoping it arrives before friday what kind of sleeping bag do you get uh it's a browning minus 30 degree sleeping bag it weighs 12 pounds minus 30. you're a mad man mine's only minus 20 and it weighs a ton i don't even i have such a hard time packing it up because it's so big it's 12 pounds 12 pounds yeah i don't know that's a wow that's a lot yeah it's supposed to be really wide too so it's like uh like a so back into a stuffed bag the size of a 60 inch flat screen right here if i get a rooftop tent i can just leave it up there right it'll never have to take it down no it doesn't work like that man when you go to sleep when your sleeping bag is that thick and heavy you can't fold up the tent with that inside you gotta take it out challenge accepted okay challenge accepted i can't wait to see this i'm gonna watch we'll make a video clayton have you thought about putting a rooftop tent on your truck ever or um not my truck but the corolla oh that'd be funny that would be awesome that'd be good that's that's the over landing rig yeah that would instantly triple its value i need some sort of roof rack system um i've been thinking about designs and how i would fab one up and then yeah the tent on there would be just looks so cool that'd be amazing uh i had a friend who wanted to put one on his uh his side by side as well but i figured it would probably be a little bit too heavy for the top you know it would be then that would be top heavy yeah and if i ever put one on the truck it needs to be like flush with the bed i don't want it any higher than or you've yeah yeah that's the one thing about the thought of putting this smart cap on the truck uh is then i end up with this 10 on top but i also have the rack over the cab now so if i got the 10 a little higher then i can you know if i put some stuff over top of the cab as well it'll kind of balance out the height and it won't look as stupid yeah straight axle what's so funny 250 hey um looking through some of the questions here yeah what do we got here here's a good one how did you guys all meet each other on the internet youtube youtube i think i commented in one of sean's videos i think you messaged me on instagram it might have been it i might have saw your videos and then instagram messaged you yeah we all started talking around the same time sometime around the beginning of this year and then i had this idea of uh of starting a group chat to talk about youtube stuff and and and then yeah then we just started talking every day and now we got a live show flex friday on thursdays yes so many people are triggered by that yeah i get a lot of you guys know it's not friday right yeah why is this on it's friday somewhere okay yeah just deal with it yeah good times what else we got for questions [Laughter] yeah it was kind of a crazy week so uh oh you know what i wanted to talk about was the uh new gymkhana video oh jimcon 2020 with travis pastrama did you guys watch that i watched that like and everybody watched an hour ago and i was like what what what it was so good yeah i kind of feel like you know he upstaged ken block significantly yeah yeah so when you sent me that link i thought it was going to be a ken block video yeah and then i was like what travis pastrama and then it was so funny and he started off with that crate that crazy jump over the bridge what that's like crazier than anything i've seen in a movie you guys see i'm never seeing rosie took off on the dock shot or is it no really watch it there's literally like three gopros lined up on the dock and this tire hits every single one of them that shot where his tire went off the block when he was literally dressed like three gopros i love those videos just because they do so much stuff all right i got so many people asking in the chat what happened to my suspension because i made a comment somewhere online that my suspension is all messed up so let me just address this uh what happened is a year of hard wheeling in a wet and muddy environment and the joints on my control arms and track bars and all that stuff are not really designed for our environment they're designed by evo for a kind of dry desert and environment so i'm here i've i've greased everything fairly regularly but because it gets so wet and muddy and you know i'm not exactly easy on the suspension uh every single control arm joint every every track bar joint uh is is completely uh toast so i've got death wobble uh my shocks are going uh oh there's all sorts of stuff going on so needless to say that is the next uh the next project is uh upgrades on the suspension of the trail wrecker it's interesting because brad um at trail recon just started releasing his best suspension for jeeps video series and i'm curious to see if his next videos will talk about maintenance and uh longevity and i'm not really sure if he will because it looks like they're all just putting a bunch of fresh new parts on jeeps and taking them out and trying to determine which you sound kind of salty when you said that that was a little salty though you said that it was kind of salty well the thing is you know it's it can be misleading right because this is basically what's happened to us where we've looked at other people doing other stuff with with their suspension setups in the nice dry desert moab climates and it's the same conversation as tires because where you wheel makes a huge difference in what parts you should be using and you know my experience with two fairly expensive suspension setups both on the jk and the jl is the jk has the same problems as your evo suspension where it's it's a high maintenance suspension and it's much more susceptible to getting dirt and mud debris in the joints and once you start getting them in the joints it causes friction and then they start unwinding or coming apart and you get the same issues that you've had with yours and i've replaced a few uh joints on my rock crawler setup and have to constantly be greasing them where going that was a big factor with choosing the teraflex system with no maintenance right um for the areas that we wheel in and that's what i'm going with as well yeah i'm going to get the teraflex non-serviceable stuff as well because lifetime warranty you don't have to grease it uh hopefully that'll be the last control arms i have to buy for this truck right yeah yeah exactly at least get more kilometers out of it and so i'm curious to see if brad will go into that because i i really do think that's a major factor in choosing your suspension and not just going for what has the most articulation or what is the easiest installation but i think the environment that you're in plays a major factor yeah for sure and it's worth noting that almost all cheap parts are not made in canada in fact i can't think of any that are made in canada like everything's made in the southern united states for the most part right so it makes sense that stuff's all designed for that environment and not for our environment and we have a very unique environment here that is wet and and muddy and uh salty and all of the things right salty just like casey [Laughter] that's salty i just want to make sure people understand because you go and see that on a huge channel and you instantly go well look at how great that one performed and then you take it up here in bc and it falls apart and yeah exactly so i'm i think there's a huge opportunity for for somebody to start making canadian made parts that are designed for this canadian environment i just don't know if if there's the the market for it or if it's difficult to sell to us customers and whatnot high abuse parts yeah or like stuff that's made for for for wet environments instead of dry environments i don't know it's very unique here we have very unique wheeling we have very unique uh needs for our trucks uh it's much different than what people are doing down in the us and i think part of that part of that is really the reason why people like our channels i think because we it's so different up here yeah the same goes for like other things like coilovers like king coilovers super popular down in the states i don't know anybody that's running king coilovers around here that just get destroyed in the mud and the the swampy trails that we're hitting in the snow and stuff and you know just the maintenance on them is extreme and uh so be interesting interesting to see how uh how your new suspension makes out but i've had no issues with the teraflex stuff for the yeah well i'm hoping it works out good we got a question for clint in the uh super chat here i see that as a noob uh not too car but having built my fourth gen foreigner for it all 19k usd what lockers work best clint for a 4 liter v6 um so we kind of went over this last week um i am a big fan of lunchbox lockers on something as new as a 4th gen 4runner i don't know if i'd recommend that especially if it's a daily driver um but for your forerunner toyota did come out with uh e-locker versions of the axles or the rear axle anyways for that um and he could probably find a reasonably priced one at a junkyard to pretty much bolt in and have a locker so that's where i'd go with that there you go yeah yes sir i don't know yeah i was just waiting to see if you were gonna say something else about that before i jumped in um yeah i've seen a couple of times uh people have asked in the chat as well what's the best budget roof top ten um i i had a i've had two smittybilt rooftop tents there but that's what i was gonna say about a thousand bucks i think there's other ones that are basically the same you can get for cheaper that are not not that not as much of a name brand if you find just somebody who's importing them from china basically you can get them for about 700 bucks yeah i think so canadian yeah uh that said i i don't think i could ever go back to one of those scents but for somebody just getting into a rooftop tent you know you can't really go wrong it's it seems like there's a really wide array of rooftop tents out there and and you know that might be a future video maybe i'll do something on the channel once i get into rooftop tents a little bit more but what are you gonna get part of me what are you going to get for a rooftop we'll have to see oh it's a secret we'll see i've unplugged everything to come together first oh i can't hear you i don't want to make two far forward looking statements but we'll see how it goes there we go but i've seen some other i think um like justin b mcbride had an interesting video of this ultra light rooftop tent which i wait i think he was saying it weighed 60 or 70 pounds and they've cut out that's really light yeah all the unnecessary oh i know what you're talking about yeah i i saw that the company yeah i can't remember either but i've seen a bunch of them on instagram um i think you're gonna have to look at quality on that one and see if it's if it's worth it but i do like that somebody's trying to do like an entry level hard top tent yeah which i think has been missing from the the market market yeah yeah mitch there uh mitch flies says it's a gfc super light there you go that's pretty crazy and just by comparison the rooftop tents i've been looking at are around 130 to 150 pounds so you're looking at half the weight over over a regular hard shell rooftop yeah i'm not sure how much my i camper skycat mini weighs but i know it weighs less than my smittybilt 130 yeah something like that it's super heavy it was definitely lighter than the the old one i had um which is nice even though i just never take it off the truck anyway so it doesn't really matter it's there yeah i mean well i guess it matters it's still weight on the back of the truck but it hasn't been an issue for me obviously nice so i was browsing instagram earlier today and i came across epic adventure outfitters page and uh i saw the new gladiator build you guys see that oh man that thing looks so cool uh paul has a huge gorilla on the side of his truck that's insane uh i saw it on his instagram story that is awesome it looks so cool man how do i bring up oh man i wish i could bring a picture of it i should have prepared this beforehand go to go to epic adventure outfitters instagram and uh they just posted a pic according to them in the chat right now so uh paul has a gorilla on the side of his truck it looks insane uh i've known about him doing this for a while and i've been really excited about it i'm thinking i'm thinking maybe i need an animal on the side of my truck i don't know what like a bear a black bear a grizzly bear like digging up the trail or something ripping the trails ripping the trail i put a link in chat for anybody who's watching who wants to go check it out right now check that out look at this guy he's all technical on it yeah yeah you're definitely gonna put web pages up on the stream you can keep your name tag now [Laughter] heard it back yeah well it's been there the whole time but you can keep it i'm not going to take it away i'm not going to abuse my power paul's rig and uh yeah that's something else yeah yeah i just clicked on the link that you posted in the chat room look at that look at that gorilla um that is an insane looking gladiator uh if you well i was gonna say if you haven't seen it in person but you probably haven't seen it in person i'm probably one of the only people who has uh it is huge it's a it's several inches higher than mine the lift on it is nuts and that's an eco diesel gladiator it's uh i think the color very cool truck hydro blue looks do you want to uh do you want to jump jump in here on a video chat and tell us about your truck what size lift is on it yeah that's really tall maybe we should talk about your truck i don't know let me know if you want to join in and i'll send you an invite link to the uh to the zoom call here on a friend yeah it was pretty wow otherwise we can do another time if you don't want to but since you're in the chat anyway also send the invite oh send the invite all right i'll send it to you uh where am i gonna send it to you so is that taller than your gladiator now with your roof rack because we were talking about the his is definitely taller than mine yeah and we're talking about the fact i've totally i've killed i've killed the video feed i've ruined everything hang on a sec all right you guys uh can continue talking i'll sort this out all right well we were talking uh oh man i were talking earlier so the ferry has an interesting height requirement of seven feet and um if you're over seven feet you gotta go down in the bottom decks and you can't stay in your vehicle you've gotta get out and go with the rest of the walk on passengers so it's always been sort of a target of mine is to stay under seven feet because i want to be able to stay in my jeep and sleep half the time because i'm usually bagged when we get to the ferry and if i start going over seven feet then i gotta get out every time and we gotta park in lower decks but is it these are island island life problems [Laughter] i fixed it we're back video is back yeah sorry about that guys yeah whoops technical difficulty all right i will go back to trying to figure out how to invite paul to the meeting yeah so uh be interesting to see but i'm just looking at the pictures of paul's right man he's got a lot going on already we've got evo sliders on it as well paul i'm gonna send you a link on uh facebook there you go and uh i'm looking at that as a half rack is there i'm assuming there's gonna be a rooftop tent going on here do a backflip he said he's not he said he's not gonna do uh a rooftop tent he's getting some crazy uh australian tent or something i don't know i'll let him uh i'm crazy i'll just kind of explain what it is when he gets on here i'm just gonna uh remove our name graphics because they will be in the wrong places we don't have names anymore that's crazy all right okay you can still kind of see the name well i was asking the zoom name i'll just a quick question um vinnie asked me here earlier about my teraflex nomads and do i like them so so the wheels that i have on the jl are terraflex's nomad wheels nice wheels follow me on instagram i just i just swapped out the rash rings from their black rash rings that they have to the new multi-piece red ones and i think they look really sharp but they have these awesome deflator valves on them that i have set to a specific psi deflating oh wait you can set the psi on those they're not just fast air out yeah it's set to 12 psi so i just open it and it stops at 12 psi which makes airing down um awesome compared to trying to use a tear down tool anyway we have here mr uh paul brassington who has a large gorilla on the side of his gladiator uh a link in the chat room paul what's going on with the gorilla what's going what's going on there we go can you hear me yeah we can hear you awesome cool um yeah i don't know i don't know why it did that it kind of uh no idea is there at any time a good reason to say let's you know throw a giant animal on the side of your vehicle is going to be done no i um i think that was a brilliant idea yeah yeah no it's uh it's on the drive home tonight i got uh stopped three times at the traffic place you got a gorilla on your jeep yes i know i know that's on there um [Laughter] somebody didn't just stick it on the parking lot at walmart that's amazing yeah we did it uh trying to do graphics like that is is you have to use the right material and so we didn't want it to be super reflective like when we did the giant epics up the side of our vehicles before we had that as a like super reflective material so i didn't want the whole thing to be reflective um i wanted to be somewhat understated wait wait you wanted it to be understated but you got a giant blue gorilla on the side of your gladiator i know if you notice in that picture of course i had to outline it with neon green because you know yeah so we made the teeth are reflective and the eyeballs are reflective so when you hit it with light definitely stands out um yeah when christian gets his uh mojave is hopefully coming soon when we get the mojave we're going to do a werewolf or something cool on the side of that as well sweet um yeah so that should be pretty cool but no it's just something different i've been in car culture a long time and so that's kind of more like your 80s and early 90s japanese car culture where they put those crazy yeah creating characters and stuff on the side of their vehicle so we thought hey let's do that mix it with a bit of uh 1980s um saturday morning cartoon vibe so i don't know it's uh yeah it works it's something different it definitely matches that's such a bright because it's different yeah that's such a bright blue color too and then you've got the blue gorilla i think it's amazing should i put a grizzly bear on the side of the trail wrecker that course you show that's a rhetorical question let me let me know what you guys think in the comments uh i'm curious animals so paul's ecodiesel gladiator is the biggest uh brightest gladiator that i've ever seen uh when i park next to him i feel uh uh uh what's the right word for this insignificant inadequate i feel inadequate when i park next to him so what did you tell why don't you tell everyone what you did to your your eco diesel gladiator uh so essentially the suspension on it is the same springs you have so we did the evo 4.5 inch plush ride springs i just like how those uh handle it gives you a very nice ride but they do sag the moment you start adding a bunch of weight to it so um and i think over time it probably sags as well as what you have and then you have the very first copy of those springs they've been updated since then i believe so that probably has something to do with it but we did that and then as you were talking about earlier with our climate and those kind of things i've run evil lifts a couple times before in different vehicles um as you're talking about the joints the johnny joints in them just aren't really made for our climate um so they break down you can rebuild them which is fine you know and you got to grease them and all that kind of stuff uh so i just went with the teraflex ir they are bushings and they're alpine arms so uh with those essentially it's non-cervical joint but it's got you know lifetime warranty it's still got a great amount of flex to it it's quiet um never have to worry about it so we've had those on quite a few vehicles um so we did all eight arms on there uh on the gladiator and then we did uh obviously the sway bar link something like kind of jazz as well um extended bump stop sway bar links um kind of custom put it together that way uh because the engine is heavier than an eco diesel and we've done we're doing a couple eco diesels uh pretty much a week now no problem when we're doing these uh we use a one inch spacer on top of those springs um so when you do that it just brings up the engine yeah it just kind of levels it out because the engine's about three hundred and something pounds heavier that's right yeah that just levels it out um yeah and it turns out turns out it's nice and level looks good drives really nice i'm using uh falcon 2.1 shocks from teraflex falcon shocks at the moment um when they come out keep bothering our rep like every day when they finally come out with the three threes or the 3.5 electronically adjustable ones yeah um you know we've got a whole bunch of those on order so right now i'm gonna be careful because we're installing a bunch of two ones on all these eco diesels everywhere and we're gonna be swapping those for three threes so i'm going to have a whole bunch of extra ones so we've got like a dozen on dozen plus on order uh for the first order so we've been guaranteed to get those first and get those in canada first and work on those so really looking forward to that because i love falcon adjustable shocks are amazing but the two ones are great great option as well um and then we have um maxis i've never run max's tires before um so i actually had a long talk with a lot of people down south and also in australia australia everybody loves max's tires they put them in all the land cruisers um those max's razor mt's so i thought let's get those um so far i haven't really had them super off-road yet sean and i are gonna go check them out next week here off-road but yeah um they're just they're super sticky i find them super sticky so i don't know if they're going to really last all that long like nitto ridge grapplers or trail grapplers were or any other kind of brand like that so i'm really looking forward to seeing how those go um so yeah those are 38 13 and a halfs and they're on a 20 inch black rhino wheel yeah the wheel looks like a tank wheel or something it's it's a nice looking wheel called the abrams yeah they call it the aluminum wheel yeah yeah it's pretty cool no they're not a bead lock now no i i have no patience for b locks my patience my patience has run out already sean knows what i'm talking about i've had beadlocks for like three weeks and i hate them what in the story i don't hate them i just i realize what a predicament i've got myself in why don't we why don't we unfold that a little bit what do you what are you okay so first of all they're um well there are a lot of work to mount tires onto so if you need to put new tires on them it's either gonna take you a lot of time or a lot of money or both uh so there's that and um they they require a lot of maintenance which is fine um but i need i need new tires and when i uh i don't know long story short i've got us i've got to get new tires soon and i saw how much it worked it was to put the tires that i have onto the bead locks yeah and now just to have to go through that all over again sounds like a pat like a hassle um also the uh the offset is wrong on my beadlock wheels so the tires stick out really far yeah what offset did you go with um i think it's three and a half yeah it's like it's a jk offset so they're basically jk wheels i think um yeah so i guess i guess the other ones i had would be four and a half uh yeah usually four and a half or four seven five somewhere in there yeah so for somehow i thought they were the same and i just i messed up somewhere and so they stick out so far like they stick out about two to two and a half inches past the fender flares which is a little bit too much considering it's pretty aggressive considering uh how aggressive the police are about that kind of thing here uh it's yeah yeah i don't want to end up in a situation where i have to go get an inspection so that would be uh a rough day yeah so i'm either i'm thinking i'm still trying to figure out what i i need new tires next year basically early next year at the latest so depending on when i get new tires uh i'm either gonna put them probably on the wheels that i had before or i'm gonna look at getting something else so i don't know maybe uh if you're watching this let me know nomads are nice i do like them but i don't want to look like your truck maybe i'll swap you maybe we'll buy something new and you want some bead locks not those ones i got a set i got a set for you let's try it you've got a jk you know yeah it's got bead locks haven't you seen it yeah ugly ones ugly ones ugly bead locks those are trail readies man with the competition rings they're awesome um i just i'm going to point out real quick that clint you've completely failed in your one job tonight which was trying to waiting for this to end to say we should bri your one job was to give away the freedom recovery gear soft shackle for this week i was gonna say let's finish this off with with some questions cause we got a shot yeah let's do that okay hit us with all your questions in the chat right now we've got 143 people in the chat you must have some questions for us giving away his jeep to the best question uh paul is giving away his jeep that's crazy um uh paul you're you're i'm super excited to go wheeling with your gorilla wait a minute so it says khan above it is that the name of the gorilla is that the name of your jeep or what that's kind of the uh it's the name of the jeep we're going to call it con yeah okay awesome nice so the your next jeep will be called the wrath of khan this is just the build up to that jeep yeah this is just you're not for the next speed yeah your foreshadowing yeah yeah okay so we're gonna uh wait for a few questions to roll in here and then clint is gonna pick the question because that was his job and then uh if you need to be in canada or the united states if you want to win a soft shackle we have a soft shackle from freedom recovery gear who uh makes amazing recovery here and uh they're all handmade very cool stuff uh you need to be in canada or the united states i'm gonna need your name phone number address emailed to sean at the storytel now.com if you're chosen credit card number i don't need that casey uh but thank you if you want to give me your credit card number dirty and dangerous.com uh we've got hoodies t-shirts stickers uh you can put your credit card number in there appreciate the support all right well i think the best question we got here is from colton and it says uh we'd love to know how long you guys have been into wheeling and what got you into it as well as what your first off-road rings were so i'll start okay i i got into it with my current truck i've i haven't been into wheeling for very long um maybe starting three years ago or so um yeah i got my toyota pickup i started i got the truck specifically to work on it i wanted a vehicle that i could work on myself and learn how to do mechanics on and then it slowly turned into the beast it is today and you can't just own something like that and not use it um for sure yeah that was a few years ago i got into this how about you guys casey yeah well i've been wheeling for with my own rig for almost four years so we started out with the bone stock jk the red one and uh slowly uh emptied my bank account into it and uh but i've i've always been a big uh car guy so i've been wrenching on cars since i was a teenager and uh i went out wheeling a few times with some friends here on the island and i just thought it was a lot of fun and the the challenge with the car community here on the island is there's not a lot of places to go to really enjoy your your car right there's there's not you know like you can't enjoy it like you can off-road rig on the trails and to me that was uh very appealing to be able to you mean you can't wheel your corvette yeah well if we hit a million subscribers we might yeah and uh six by six by six yeah six by six quarter lifted corvette what what am i doing in a million guys [Laughter] we'll do the conversion it'll be perfect yeah perfect and uh yeah so i just found 4x4 a lot of fun because you don't have to worry about you know getting pulled over other than to and from the trail if your rig's too crazy but it's nice to be able to enjoy a vehicle to its full capabilities and not worry about getting arrested so that was really kind of a attractor to me and then we started going out and seeing more places and experiencing more locations and that was just uh a lot of fun so here we go yeah right on for me i um i was living out of the country for a few years and i moved back and uh i started when i got back i started going camping a lot with a buddy of mine and uh i bought a mazda miata at the time uh because for a car ultimate and uh when my friend said camping i didn't know he meant like 20k up in the back country so here i am like wheeling this mazda miata and he's like wasn't at a hotel he's like man you why don't you just go on craigslist and spend a thousand dollars and buy like a ford explorer or something so that you don't trash your sports car and i was like oh okay i started looking into it and before you know it i bought a xj uh for like uh three thousand dollars or so and uh yeah and then spiraled from there so and that was about 2014 so i've been wheeling for about six years paul you want to get in on this yeah i uh you've probably been wheeling longer than any of us eh yeah because you're so old i'm like super old [Laughter] uh yeah i've uh where do i start with i started with uh samurais so suzuki samurais i had some suzuki samurais uh spring over axle lifts and 33-inch tires which are huge on a samurai if you could think of that um yeah i went from samurais to yj's uh one of my favorite trucks was an 88 4runner i had a really great 884 runner it was awesome thumbs up from uh toyota clint over here of course love to hear that [Laughter] yeah the the uh after replacing the back window and the fenders about 80 times and yeah it was a really great truck and then i got back into jeeps uh after a bit of a hiatus got into a new jk and then had the white jk had a couple jks um then i've had jl now i've had two jts this is my second jt so yeah and a diesel like that with a giant gorilla on the side giant gorilla on the side here we are all leading up to that there's no obstacle that you cannot conquer with that gorilla on the side no definitely not nothing no i got into the newer jeeps because we're driving such long distances when you're driving to california or you're driving to mexico or you're driving to arizona yeah the storage you can do that in a yj but you're not going to be comfortable so it's kind of like yeah i think it's time to upgrade and get a you know a decent decent vehicle with some creature comforts inside with still the same capability so that's why we're in where we're at now but yeah right a huge factor for me buying the eco diesel too right after multiple road road trips down to oregon and all over the place in the jk um i had enough i'm gonna keep doing it we're gonna not hate it so much yeah yeah awesome all right well i think we're gonna wrap it up here for the night guys it's uh it's about that time thanks for tuning in to flex friday arrive i still can't say it flex friday live number six on thursday i cannot pronounce words friday live on thursdays um i've got a video coming up on monday it's going to be a fun adventure so make sure you tune in monday 9am pacific uh we'll do a live premiere you can join in the chat it'll be a fun time clint yep for uh those of you that don't know or were listening earlier i did the solid axle swap earlier this week that video was dropping tomorrow we did record most of the process so if you're interested uh yeah that comes up solid axle swap adventure casey what you got coming up on casey 250 uh saturday we've got the long term eco diesel review and my thoughts after owning it for eight months and putting 12 000 kilometers on it so we're gonna go through some of the things i like time to upgrade to a gladiator yeah well wait wait wait until you watch the video awesome paul do you have a uh video coming up on epic adventure outfitters channel no all right when do i honestly when do i have time i do not have time all right well we're going we're going out next week uh we have a lot of videos on our channel check out epic adventure outfitters on youtube yeah a lot of adventure videos and a lot of build videos and uh we'll be doing a walk around and stuff on the new eco diesel gladiator with the giant gorilla we'll be doing all that some probably in the next week yeah and we're going wheeling with the eco diesel gladiator on with the gorilla on tuesday so with the grill on too with the gorilla with khan so uh there'll be a video coming on both of our channels for that one sometime probably in the new year so that's right that's how we're at all right guys uh thanks for tuning in make sure you check out dirtyindangers.com to get our merch uh

thanks for tuning in bye [Music] you", "_3v71fexFDE": "yeah guys doing this is Neil from perfect Sun LED calm and Africa is a grow update for you so I'm going to show you guys really quickly what what plants we have going on and then we'll play the actual video update where you'll see me in real time training this blue dream back here and I'll show you some cool trick on how you can do an alternative type of mainlining training that i'm doing for the blue dream which is a photo period these are the three Auto flowers I'm gonna give a quick update for those that haven't been watching what three plants these are how old they are and then I have two different videos so I'm gonna be showing both of them so one at 46 days old which is this one and then another one at 56 days also ten days later you can see how the training took in just ten days alright so here we have the Afro DITA and this is at Auto flower I believe that one is by world of seeds and so Auto flower obviously this one here is the glue berry og which when I click very soon the gorilla glue OG or the grail of gluten allergy just guerrilla glue my fast buds and all that and back here is in New York City diesel auto flower by I believe advanced seeds and so anyway yeah there you go that's the day 46 now I'll show you at day 56 and then we'll go ahead and go to action over the update and then I'll talk about some cool things some some grow tips and stuff and things to avoid alright alright so before we get to the actual video where I do real-time update here I show you guys the plants in real time which I don't do very often here we go so we have the afroditi this is only ten days later the afroditi the Gorilla Glue and then back here we have the New York New York City diesel and behind over here we have the blue dream which I could show you really quickly you can see how much she's recovered we'll go through this again now well actually you know it this video does it human you can kind of see her back there a little bit right there blue dream I thought yeah you can't see like that back there you can see she's recovered quite a bit but we'll go and go through these videos and I'll come back and talk about some tips of stuff and what we've been doing alright hey how you guys doing so doing a quick update here this is the Blue Dream this is a photo period what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start mainlining here I think to make her stay short and bushy I don't know I kind of don't want to do a full main line I just don't know if I'm gonna have enough time to do that because it does take a while for a plant to grow at the full main line but main line training is like where you just keep two branches on the bottom and then you let those go out horizontally should start at that earlier if I was gonna do that so instead I'm going to do is see how kind of bowl changer right now I'm gonna take off the top several nodes and a couple branches and then I'm gonna leave all those bottom branches down there and I'll say that looks like in just a second old old-time video for those that remember that's inside Joe if you guys but you're an old watcher so anyway here he goes I cut off the whole entire top there that can actually make it really nice I can make some nice clones out of that there's a lot of clones on there I can make but I don't like here to clone the blue dream and then I'm going to take these branches I'm going to tie them down to the edge but the main ones I want to take the long I'm really beginning to dislike these edge phones I really hope the next generation has an on edge version because I've even turned off edge functionality and it still sometimes just holding the phone try and record it'll like kill the peak Alex I'm trying to do something with it I think I take off a few of the bottom branches and I'm gonna tie these branches down I wanted to grow horizontally because this is a horizontal room well it's a square room but I grow an 8 by 4 of it so I want it to go eight by eight way right so the four way I want to have only a couple branches smaller ones go into this way cover the four direction and the other branches I want them to try to go as long as possible to cover the long direction so that's the goal here I should have started that kind of training earlier but oh well okay now here when I could something I do that real quick and I'll show it look like all right in the end I have it tied down like that so I have these three branches going that way those two branches going that way that's gonna be the horizontal way and these two here I'll just be there for a little bit of the other way the shorter distance the four-foot distance alright cool and really quickly here's the rest of the plants we've got New York City Diesel back there they all almost died because she forgot to water and they were like almost dead and I was gonna throw them out start over but they for the most part recovered it definitely is going to reduce their yield and not only is going to reduce their yield but it's gonna it's gonna reduce probably well when it reduced their size big time I think that New York City sort of got a lot bigger but it's you know it's 2 and 1/2 feet so I'm like that this one I'm actually surprised the grille glue shut up because she was really small and then the afroditi alfredito it's about how big she would be anyway she's not a very big plant besides she's not fully into flour yet so she might still stretch more these two are probably out there at their final sizes they might get a little bit bigger but not much so that's the new york city diesel really blew by fast boats and aphrodesia these three autos that ones the photoperiod that's getting trained for when these ones finish I might even start a couple more autos so that my time they are this big these ones will be done and then I can give that photo period extra time to veg so Jen's a pretty serious training on it as you can see I'll see bahala see how she looks when these are almost done well now if I do that then I can't plant autos so I got I got to decide soon upon the plateaus or not I can just plant them I guess what they don't and just give that thing extra time to bed just for the hell of it good to heavens anyway so there we go that's the update she's starting to put on a little bit of sugar on the leaves as you can see there that's the grill of glue afroditi says she's not fully flowering yet so she does have little ways to go and then New York State Diesel back there you can also see the New York City Diesel especially since it was trying to recover the light was too intense for her you can see yeah not leaf right that's those things are just too much intense I moved over to the corner more this kind of stuff my wife doesn't you know fully know how to do yet is you know thinking about stuff on the fly like when stuff happens and so I've been trying to get in here but my health makes it very difficult well yeah so alright cool alright cool so that was update let's go and look at some cool stuff here I want to talk about with the plants and things to watch out for some little you know tips that you can look out for when you're growing let me see I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the sound when I play this that way so here here's the update here and I want to show you guys I think there's a part here loosing bias this is under the perfect son max yield right now we just have one light on this whole time also keep in mind this is without co2 once again because I haven't been able to get down and actually fill the tank up yet but you know as you can see honestly so there's the blue gene this I want to show you that's probably the best shot I'm gonna get right there so here's the blue dream now you can see that she's recover nicely this is all the new growth and so under my light the lights so intense that's really gonna show you like the difference between new growth and an older growth you see how much brighter green the new growth is this is this as normal you know you can see some new growth here too that's fine so don't worry about it but yeah you can see that so look how much she's recovered already look how much more bushes she as you can see these these branches already starting to grow out wider and taller and I'm gonna keep on training these three branches and these three branches to grow this way horizontally like this way this way so I gotta come back here we got to put some cutting to do is tie some bamboo sticks or put some holes is he on we're in fabric pots so we'll put some holes here on the sides of the pots and then had the bamboo sticks going through like that and then we'll tie down the branches to the bamboo sticks as it grows I'll show you guys a diagram what I'm talking about here in just a second so that will be cool anyway so that's what we're under the blue dream and I was debating whether or not I should start more on flowers and then let her really veg out even longer since I'm doing such intense training to her but then I was like well I don't know what if then what if she veg is way too long it's way too big I gotta control you know so I think I'm doesn't go ahead and see what happens here with this so right now these are at day 56 you know and so I don't know we'll say at day 56 that means I probably whether you're looking now especially the afro DITA I don't think that Perdita is gonna finish and tell like man probably day 86 I'm thinking another Sami sick she might and then either twenty days she might be close to being done I think the New York City so I think that won't be a lot closer to being done in twenty days I'm something that she has another you know anywhere from twenty to thirty days longer I can veg out after that I have to fetch her for because these ones aren't gonna be finished yet and that I actually want to veg her a little bit longer after that cuz I want to give her the full length of they buy four to really try to Train her out to be you know as big as possible in there I just don't and also I probably should transplant her because right now she's still in a small pot so we have to transplant her into another pot I should play I do that to your very soon and we'll put over here on this side right now she's just had this little corner this whole time so I think it's time to move over here under her own light and put her in a bigger pot and let her start really taking off because she's recovered now about ten days after this hard training and she she's recovered she's growing nicely she's grew a lot within that ten days you see help me like little leave she had in the other video look how many believe she has now so yeah it's scary I know like even my wife was like oh my god he killed the plant but I've done this before so you just the first couple times you do it is kind of freaky when he do that kind of intense training because you like took almost all the branches off and all the leaves off and you're like always she kind of recover from this and she does look at she's fine so yeah anyway so let's go ahead and look at some other stuff here some tips and I want to show you guys how we're gonna train that plan out further I also I'm gonna be starting another grill inside the bedroom so with with some vegetables by adding my throw like one CBD Otto flower in there because CBD actually the CBD strains have really been helping her so she can smoke more regular weed without having the you know the paranoia or the panic the kind of panic attacks that come with it when you smoke too much THC not everyone is affected by that but she is so the kind of like half and half the one to one ratio stuff where you have let's say a percent CBD and eight percent THC if she smokes some of that before she smokes regular strong stuff that really helps so we're and we're going to grow some of our own so I got a nice CBD strain I'll be good I'll be showing you guys and that's an as it'd be it'd just be a bedroom Burrow so it's starting to cool off so I think it won't be too hard to keep it cool in there we're gonna be do that in a glide the Goliath of v2 and just in case because then I know like I think if I run out of room in there like last time I don't use a light move or something so the by a few - lets the plants get really close within like a foot away from the light without burning them so I think I'm going to grow a pepper plant or two as well and then maybe some lettuce or something so we'll see and it's a much easier for me to get in it to get in that bedroom and go all the way out on the garage so I should be able to go in there on a more regular basis and do little video updates for you guys alright so here well I want to show you guys after d-day up close see this right here I've talked about this before but for those that haven't watched all my backlog videos I'll talk about this right here again you see the edge the teeth of the leaves how they're pointy you have a really sharp and then they start curling up like this there's a couple things that can cause that the most common is gonna be light stress or heat stress in this case I know it's not too hot in the room and so she's just not handling the light very much so she was pretty close to light I think they're I think they're actually a little bit closer she's a little bit closer I think than two feet away I think she was about eighteen inches away she obviously doesn't like that so this was a good thing so afroditi if you want to plant that you know like gorilla glue where they don't need as much light then this is a good plant for that so I can tell I've heard EDA is not a it's not a heavy light plant and so I should move her over and so if I if I would have been in there every day this would have been done before these leaves got this curled up but this is the you know they can handle this kind of stress right here this isn't really gonna harm any thing actually sometimes I like to push them this far maybe not this far but almost this far because it's gonna really help them pack on the density and weight I always like to try to get the light as close as possible without like stressing them too much but a little bit stress is fine so I'll probably do with this one is just have her move it out a little bit like about four inches toward the corner you know so right now it's more toward the center of light just move it out toward the corner more and then she'll be fine another thing that could cause this would be like something like magnesium deficiency or something but she doesn't have that she's fine and so she's still kind of early in her flowering stage just she's just barely in her beginning flower stage look at this she says that the other ones are definitely more ahead of her so yeah I thought that she was a very fast plant but keep in mind if you get a Perdita I don't know this might just be this particular female if you get afroditi it might it might be an 80-day plant 85 day plant because she definitely takes her time so there's the blue gym again the blue gym is the photo period there's there's the where I cut it off right here the whole top took all that off I left you know these branches these branches and those branches down there sink I left three nodes you can look how much leaves they've grown since last time pretty crazy yeah she's ready to probably be transplanted now and in the next couple days will definite answers now it's now technically like two days later so this was on November well I have the dates written down hold on there we go so November 2nd was day 56 now two of them the New York City diesel and the grill glue actually three days ahead might has been talking about these dates because I I messed up somewhere on the dates anyway so and I think it's I think they're more closer to this but whatever it's fine so that was November 2nd which is this last video the first video I showed you but when I was trying to burn out my sari I was kind of confused there the first video I showed you where I did the training when I'll show you how I cut it and stuff and train the branches down tied the branches down that was way back in October my third one they were 42 46 days old now right now it's November 4th so just so you know what you know this was I'm basically showing you a video this video right now you're looking at was taken two days ago so or two days from this day if you watch it November 4th ok so anyway but yeah so you can see how much further along the Gorilla Glue is Gorilla Glue by fast buds usually finishes a day about 65 68 deathly should be finished by day 70 so I'm thinking that this will be the first one to come out so she's a fast fast finishing plant and she doesn't usually care for much light but look it she's actually decently close to light is actually unfortunate though that they weren't watered correctly so you can see she actually suffered a little bit here with some uptake probably calcium uptake where she sees little hole like little looks like little burn leaves or burn holes in the leaves but for the most part she's fine you can see it's hard to kind of see what this lighting but you can see look she's starting to pack some sugar on these leaves here you can see all these see all those little nice sugar spots so yeah she looks like she's gonna be nice once she starts really packing on that weight you know right now like like that you know once the buds start looking like this I start stacking up this is when they really start packing on the weight she was in New York City so you can see that the hair is all nice and white and fluffy still but within the next 20 days she's gonna really start swelling up and she might actually be done in 20 days so I think that the gorilla glue will probably be done right now it's day 56 let's say so I'm thinking by yeah 50 60 not far not far away less than 20 days in for her I think we'll see and then New York City Diesel she might go to day 76 so she applied she might have another 20 days from the day that I told you how old these are not necessarily from how long you've watched his video but time you watch this video that might be long done you might be watching this video in 2022 or something who knows but yes so there you go cool you can see kinda how far away the light is right there the New York City Diesel I think is the closest to the light right now that's why I moved her over to the corner more so she's not under the center of the light she's more toward the corner of the light and yeah so but she's doing really good I think I might rearrange them though might raise the light a little bit and rearrange the plants this one the blue James gonna go over here under its own light I think I'm gonna move to maybe move the New York City some more toward the center this one I can't keep up more over here on the edge because she doesn't need that much light and then Gorilla Glue doesn t much light either I think I'm gonna move these more to the edge and have the New York City so kind of occupy the center more of the light and raise the light just a little bit so she's not so close to the center of it yeah so I'd be good so I'm raising about two feet above her which is good about 24 inches so all right cool so that's it guys thanks for watching hope you guys enjoyed the video I thought it had something else I wanted to talk about but I don't think I do yeah I can't think of anything else right now if you have any questions though about growing all that kind of stuff definitely go ahead and leave comments in the video I appreciate that and if you guys want to what lights I grow up I put that in the beginning of the video which is perfect son LED calm the link is also in the description go check those lights out as of right now what as of right now when to make the day that this video came out I have in stock the dwarf stars the minis let's see here what else I believe the Goliath the glide v2s are going to be ready any day now so yeah the Goliath fetus and also I'll have more max yields really any day now as well so stay tuned for that so those two big lights the mega I don't know when those will be back in stock again I'm not only worried about that right now I'm really just trying to focus on the glide fee too and see you you know because a lot of people been asking for that kind of design so we'll see how that does for a little while and then I'll then I'll bring back the mega maybe but for now that's filling in that that particular portion but yeah anyway so that that's the update for the lights and yeah definitely go check them out like I said the glide fee too should be in stock any or be ready any day now to ship again that's the same thing as saying be in stock and then max yield maybe about another I'm hoping within a week that they'll be ready to ship to alright double peace thanks for watching", "6QlGOXBtNbQ": "jessica brown has been trending over the past couple of days and tesca ran out of her normal hairspray she thought she could substitute it with gorilla glue and here's how that all went hey y'all for those of y'all that know me know my hair has been like this for about a month now it's not my choice no it's not a choice when i do my hair i like to you know finish it off with a little got to be glue spray you know just to keep it in place well i didn't have any more got to be glue space so i use this gorilla glue spray bad bad idea yo look my hair it don't move you hear what i'm telling you it don't move i've washed my hair 15 times and it don't move stiff where my hair so i'm gonna tell y'all like this if you ever ever run out of got to be glue spray don't ever ever use this all right so that video is 20 million views on tick tock so people started offering solutions for her including coconut oil tea tree oil rubbing alcohol none of those helped she eventually went to the er they tried some things which did help she's been trying more intense products at home which you see here she hasn't provided a further update over the past like 24 hours but it doesn't seem like those have helped either yeah she's reportedly considering suing gorilla glue which has turned a lot of people against her on social media gorilla glue released this statement yesterday saying they are sorry to hear about her unfortunate incident and this is a unique situation because this product is not indicated for use in or on hair as it is considered permanent and they point out that their warning label states this they do wish her the best in figuring something out uh yeah now somebody who is offering sympathy's beyonce's hair stylist neil farina who wrote on instagram we all have our own opinions she made a big mistake uh but but we going to give but we got to keep tearing her down uh he then tags a lot of people who might have her contact info for tessica and then added when she leaves the hospital if she needs a wig or taking care of her scalp i'm here for yeah nicole says if you've ever looked at packaging and wondered who on earth the warning was for here you go abe says uh just shave it off uh shad says maybe plastic surgery will have to be a result joyce is why would anyone use that in the first place yeah keisha what are your thoughts on this well first i mean you only get gorilla glue at where like a home hardware store um and on it even specifically says like wood metal surround like it says uh things in your house to use it for like i always thought of it as something like if you know if a coffee table were to break down and i can't figure out how to screw it together to slap some gorilla glue but even gorilla glue you know don't let it go near your hands you touch that and you got a serious problem she can't shave off her hair obviously because the glue is stuck to her scalp omg i just took that in that is crazy um yeah i don't know i'm surprised she was even able to go that long without not getting it uh sorted i know that somebody offered to take care of it for her and i thought that she flew to l.a to kind of have that sorted out somebody was helping her here's my thing gorilla glue isn't responsible for this um but as a gesture it does disappoint me that they didn't um just do something at a goodwill out of good faith because it is something that people are looking at a little bit they can afford to help a sister out and i thought that they could have you know they could have helped in my opinion yeah i uh i talked to her yesterday morning and the the hospital the hospital visit was she they showed her with a bunch of stuff on her head and it looked like she had some sort of cream on her head but what it was was she tried all the remedies that people you know wrote her on social media so one of them was alcohol and with a cotton swab and what was all over her head were just the pieces of the cotton swab that then got stuck to the gorilla glue as it started to sort of get a little bit wet and what the doctors were doing was using nail polish remover swabs and they were going at the back to try and get the ponytail out and she could only do it for five ten fifteen minutes at a time to burn so bad so they had they sent her home with a full kit so people at home so she could at least be comfortable at home while they um while they while they did that and you know it's it's it's like a it's a tale she's in a terrible terrible situation she couldn't shave it because the razor the hair is glued to her actual scalp right it's not that the hair is all put together it's glued to her actual head so you can't even get to get in there get in there with a razor but um she's in uh she's in a bad way i know that you know people you know like to goof on stuff like this and you know how dumb could you possibly be but that aside okay the dumbness happened she made the mistake and now a girl you know has gorilla glue on her head and a permanent ponytail that's sort of ripping her scalp in the back and i just hope she gets the help that she really needs yeah like that's how i feel about it i mean it's one thing to make a stupid mistake but i mean now this has been like this for a month i mean she's going through a lot of pain like no one can wish that on anyone like you make a mistake she's the wrong product it's stupid for her to do it but i mean you don't wish this kind of pain on someone yes it's going on for a month now when it comes to suing i don't believe she has any case whatsoever i think yeah like with most people she loses sympathy for me in that case like you can't sue like this is absolutely completely your fault you knew what you're doing i feel awful that's happened to her but once we get into it's gorilla glue's fault no i'm sorry like tesco like this is your fault yeah completely and i don't know if i agree with gorilla glue doing anything about it because what precedent does that set if there are in no way is gorilla groot glue at fault in this so what precedence does that set if they do do something i don't know like into the monetary money i think my issue is that i know that they're not responsible because it's pretty clear in the packaging that this is not something you put even near your skin my thing is more just with their statement i just feel like they could have said well this is how you get gorilla glue off your skin if it gets on your skin like there could have been some sort of just they could have said something of how she could solve her issue they could have made a public statement about hey guys this can go near your skin it's danger to that this is for this type of materials whoopty whoop but as a gesture of goodwill and not to set a precedent but just as a gesture of goodwill we empathize with her we know she's been going through this experience we hope this is a learning lesson for other people um and we've and maybe just putting her in touch with the right person to help take you guys created it so tell us how when there's issues i mean any product you have if there's ever an issue if it's defective um if it gives you allergy whatever the heck you can call pretty much anyone and be like why is this happening and they can give you some sort of solution that statement was very like about it that's just my opinion i know she still that was a bad call but just out of i mean i just did a kindness now i'm like i don't even want to use girl glue for nothing yeah indigo says this girl can't even raise her hair and scalp help if her skull cannot breathe poor thing yeah michelle i hope she's okay yeah at the end of this you just hope she ends up being okay", "VF5S0uGG6tg": "You've got park vehicles coming through. You've got trucks loaded up with charcoal. And that's why Chimanuka is just so tense\nabout crossing the road. If it was just him, it'd be fine. So, he's just waiting nervously for a quiet time to cross\nwith his whole family. I feel for him. After 20 minutes,\nwe take matters into our own hands... and Lambert stops the traffic. Look at this! Oh, my gosh! Now, there you go.\nThat's confidence for you. With Chimanuka in charge, the orphan Marhale is confident enough\nto venture out. Whoa! Oh, fantastic! Oh, my gosh, look at this! The whole family! Mwira and his mother are almost the last\nones to break cover and scamper over. Absolute confidence. Look! With all the youngsters across safely...\nChimanuka can stop being the lollipop man. The boss, showing... us that despite there's a road\nrunning through... this is still his jungle. I love it! It's a great relief\nto see the whole family across the road in safety. This area is more densely forested\nthan the sections we've been in before. It's criss-crossed with gorilla trails. So, there are clearly\nother families around. And Mugaruka's arrival\njust adds to the numbers. Here he comes. Oh, my word! Right down on to the road. Amazing. He didn't even... I thought maybe he'd stop,\nbe a bit reluctant, but across he came, metres from me. To see him out in the open like this,\nyou see how big he is. Amazing!", "SJQSMDg2lw0": "hey everyone shawn here from grayscale gorilla in today's quick start i'm going to show you how we can get the most out of our new car paint materials so after you've gone ahead and downloaded them from the grayscale gorilla hub they will automatically appear in the plus library and as you can see we have here arnold octane and redshift in this case i'm going to show you how to set up the redshift versions the other important thing we want to keep in mind is that we are running the latest version of redshift that supports osl in this case 3.0.39 so i'm going to throw this blueprint blue here onto these body parts which i've kind of isolated out from this wonderful corvette model which you can snag off of cg trader if you want to follow along but i'm uh yeah i'm going to fire up the render view and let's see what we get here and just like that out of the box we get a very nice looking car paint i'm going to try out this hot orange definitely a favorite another one that turned out really cool is this magnetic gray especially on this corvette looks pretty sweet now if i hop into this closer camera here that i've set up we can get a better look at all these flakes going on and if i open up the shader graph let me dock this guy here we can dive in here and start to customize our flakes so these are procedurally based and we can get in here and adjust the scale by default the scale is set up correctly as long as your car models are set up at the correct scale if you bring in a car model you've got somewhere and the flakes are gigantic or they don't look right and you may want to adjust the scale of your car model or you can always get in here and play around with the scale in the actual shader so with these set to a value of 2 we can get a better sense of what's going on here if i crank up the density to a value of 1 now we essentially have flakes everywhere and if i turn up the randomization to you know 0.8 that's going to change sort of the virtual rotation of the flakes and if i set this to 0.1 they will appear a lot more flat so we give you a ton of control in how you can adjust these guys a value of around 2.5 or 0.25 for the randomize is pretty good and maybe the density should be around 0.4 and we'll get the scale back to a reasonable number that's looking a little more correct but yeah if we go into the rest of the material here under the base and specular layers here here's where we can start to play around with the colors so you can see even with this silver we actually have kind of this purpley base coat but let's say i wanted to make a blue paint switch this to a nice blue and then i can go into this fresnel shader here and adjust the specular coat i'm going to hop out of my close camera here you can see what we got going on this is already looking really cool and maybe i kind of put some purple in here so yeah you can just have a ton of fun with these they're a lot of fun to play with let's see here here's the flake color make green flakes if we want there we go that's looking really cool we also have some camo wraps let me throw that onto the actual car body here these turned out really cool there's this tech camo which i'm a huge fan of these are a ton of fun i really can't wait to see what everyone creates with these things thank you guys so much for checking out this video we will see you very soon in the next one", "CUaZkn0KmFI": "it's cold right here you're in pain you have pain if you feel anything if it's too uncomfortable let me know we can get you more payments okay this is

[Music]", "iB8CGn2Q-VE": "[Music] hey everybody and Tony here with a tribute video dedicated to one of my most favorite indie music duos of all time bright blue gorilla which consists of Michael Glover and Robin Rosencrantz before getting to be acquainted with this particular duo I did not know anything about them nor their body of work nor the film that really brought them on the map which was go with la Flo it was until that one time before I graduated my acting school artifacting that I got to be acquainted with them as one of my teachers forwarded an email stating that they needed extras for their film which was mr. Rodolfo's Jubilee so I jumped at the chance and told them that I would love to take part in the film as one of the extras and lo and behold I was so happy to have been a part of this film even though I wasn't extra but nonetheless managed to me a lot of really cool and interesting people who have a lot of passion for art music and everything that has brought us together as pretty much a family I even got the feeling of what it was like working with two wonderfully talented wonderfully positive minded and absolutely brilliant musicians slash filmmakers such as Michael Glover and Robin Rosencrantz I not only got acquainted to how warm inviting and encouraging their personalities were but also just how professional and just how meticulous and how brilliant they were as both musicians and filmmakers I loved working with them so much that I even jumped at the chance at being an extra in their latest film which was 36 husbands the respect the admiration and the overall love I have for them in terms of their professionalism and in terms of their encouragement knows no bounds whatsoever and for that I am completely grateful and very phoric to partake in and a couple of their projects going to Michael and Robin as musicians they have a certain quirkiness to them that is absolutely infectious which is not only reflected in their personalities but also the music and the lyrics that they write a lot of songs that they sing usually involve about a lot of interesting and offbeat themes that are nonetheless rather fascinating to witness some of them make you think some of them make you reflect on every crazy thing that's going on the world and some of them just leave you with a great smile or even leave you rolling on the floor with laughter everything about their music is composed with heart and an undeniable charm that distills with age on top of that their vocal collaboration is absolutely fine with Robins stirring and well tuned Metso soprano voice which is lush and absolutely calming to listen to combining it so well with Michael's more upbeat and vibrant bear tenor voice in short their voices blend together so wonderfully that it is practically indie music heaven let's also not forget the various instruments that they play while they mostly specialize in guitars and ukeleles they even do other instruments such as percussions like bongos as well as other instruments that I've never heard of before so ultimately it is a fine combination of great skill that they have as filmmakers musicians and singers and a lot of heart soul and love they give to the work they do each of them holds sentimental value at least to me and I don't see myself turning off everything they do anytime soon in fact I would love to tune into every piece of work they can churn out and I'm pretty sure that it will leave me as well as any other listener with a great smile on their faces especially when dreary days come speaking of which bright blue guerrillas music is also the type of music you would love to listen to especially if your days are full of excruciation pain and melancholy and especially if you have dreary days just listening to their music will transport you into another world where everything's alright and where you can feel like yourself you can feel free and you don't have to be scared of being your quirky offbeat and interestingly fascinating self in conclusion bright blue gorilla is an absolutely wonderful indie music duo whose work and whose passion and whose unconditional love they have for their craft surpasses anything in terms of music in terms of taste and in terms of genre everything they have accomplished so far has been full of positivity and a lot of joy and it reflects not only in the music but also their personalities if you haven't listened to their music please go search for their name on YouTube go listen to them on iTunes or Spotify and even purchase their soundtracks they are definitely worth listening to well that's all for this tribute be sure to tune in tomorrow for my review of Puccini's La Boheme at the deutsche opa starring ethereal glossa as prologue for so until then have a great day everybody", "Ux49H2ODveU": "hey guys bill coming back at you with another video and today I'm going to be training my gorilla glue Auto the first plant that I've ever grown in organic living soil okay guys so plants doing great let's check her out okay guys so there she is five gallon fabric pot and she is doing pretty good taking me a while to get used to the watering where it's organic living soil all I've been adding is water not pH in my pH is around seven so it's pretty neutral I don't think that'll be an issue I did have a slight problem down here earlier on but it seems to have come out of that pretty good so and she's blowing up you can see the light green in there is all new growth and she is doing pretty good so now the issue we have it now is all those big leaves they're on on there are covering all the bud sites and we can't have that so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna lean this girl right over so we're gonna be taking her and laying it right down here okay so we're gonna get right at it and I'll stick you up on the tripod we'll go ahead and do it okay so let's get right at her so I didn't get any clips like was suggested for LST so I'm just gonna go with my my tried-and-true poking holes in the bags I don't find these bags are that expensive anyway and even with holes all around the top you can still get plenty of grows out of it I mean they're its nonwoven fabric so by the time you take it back out it prepared pretty much closes itself back off anyway so okay so what we'll do here is we will first off turn the raid around we got to put an on her we're gonna be going that way we want to hold this stem on this side so that when it when we bend it that way it doesn't pull the root ball out of the ground so okay you know I like to put two holes for this so we're gonna take a a pipe cleaner put it in secure it to this side take it around the stock we don't want to pull it this way we just want to keep it from pulling the other way when we bend it down we'll stick another hole here okay we want it right at the bottom there we go and then we're going to secure that that side okay so if you can see in there we just have it secured right here at the bottom so when we bend it over its not gonna pull the root ball out of the ground okay so now we'll turn it around so what we're gonna do is we want to bend it right about an inch up and so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to take my fingers my big old thumb now that everybody loves that's my trim in now by the way we're not trimming but pruning so I'm just gonna kind of squeeze that kind of twist it a bit kind of rock it back and forth now it's actually very woody so I'm not getting much gift to it at all but we don't need a lot we just need enough that when we do actually bend it she's not gonna snap on us okay okay so she's giving away a little bit there okay good enough I think that's good enough there so what we'll do is we'll poke a hole on this side secure our pipe cleaner now we're gonna come right in here without damaging any of these little side branches wrap it around the main the main stock there and just gently pull her down now she should Bend right where I softened it but she is make sure your anchors down close to the surface of the soil and just slowly now you can do this in a couple of steps if you're kind of scared you think it's kind of snap then just stop just leave it it'll be all right you can come back in a few hours or or even come back in the morning and pull it down a little bit more whatever you're comfortable with now I'm pretty sure that she's gonna be fine so I'm gonna pull it great almost 90 percent angle on here okay and that's it and I'm not even I'm just gonna let the pipe cleaner hold it I'm not going to bother twisting it I don't want it tight I don't want to twist it around the stock because I don't want it to damage the stock within a few days I'm gonna have to readjust it anyway so we'll leave that there for now now we'll turn it around take a look at this side at this side now we can see our anchor here is holding the base so that this part is still straight and it's bent right where I squeezed it and twisted it and not bad okay so now we got a look at what do we have here underneath okay so we got some good we've got some good-sized stems coming out here so we're gonna start pulling down all these other branches - while we're at it okay so we're going to start off with this one here we're gonna put we're going to put a hole here little twist now we're going to grab ahold of this here now we're not going to get exactly where we want it right now we're just going to get it growing the way we want in the direction we want and then when we come back in a couple of days that'll be growing over here then we can we can do more with it but right now that's fine and we will come on the other side here and do the same thing okay I'm gonna come up underneath again on this one just grab ahold of it and bring it down to the direction we want okay now again I'm not going to tighten these up these are very very young we don't want to tighten anything around any branches just leave it loose as long as it's holding it there like I said we're going to come back and we're gonna we're gonna pull these all out different in a few days anyway what she gets settled okay now we have this nice one we got two here on the bottom I think what we'll do is we will put this one here we will put raid around this area poke the hole little twist now this one is very small we're gonna grab it from right inside fairly close to the base of this stem and we're just gonna pull it out like that now what that did was it brought it up off the ground and it also started bringing it this way so we can fill in this area with it and then we will spin it around now this bottom one here we want to bring this out this way okay so we're gonna put a hole here now if you're using your clippers to poke holes in the bags make sure your clipper is sideways that way if it cuts a little bit too far it'll just cut sideways if you have it like this it'll be more apt to pull through the top okay so now we'll take this one get this out here [Music] okay so again it's not exactly where we want it right now but we're just training it in the direction that we want and we can come back later and a couple of days once they grow out a bit more and fix that up okay now I think we have this one here and this one here I think we're going to leave those for right now let them grow a bit before we decide where we're going to put them I'm sure they're gonna be back this way at least one of them will be but we're gonna leave that for right now I think that's all we're gonna do for now just basically wanted to get that stuff off the ground and out and these ones start in the goat that way and we will come back and in a couple of days we'll adjust those and pull them back even further to closer to where we're going to want them in the long run okay so now the only thing we got left to do is we have to look it over and see where the leaves are now I have one leaf down here that is pointed straight down heading the ground that's going to come off okay now we also have this one here which is pointed straight up but when that top comes up that is going to be coming over here and covering all this stuff so we're going to take that one off but we're going to leave the bottom of the stem just as a bumper for that for the pipe cleaner so we have the stem here that's protecting this little branch right here so that the pipe cleaner can't bother that okay another one right up here at the top we're going to take off just to expose this area here so this will get a lot of light there's another rake down here that is right on the soil so we're going to get rid of that one okay and I think that's all we're gonna do for now for the first training just start off really small get them somewhat where we're where they're gonna end up so that when they grow it a bit they we can finish putting them where we want them but now also all the lights able to get down at all them instead of them being covered by the big leaves up top so okay guys so that's it for the first training of the Gorilla Glue Auto flower grown in kryptonite living soil my first organic living soil grow so very interesting a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to how much to water i've been watering from the top every couple of days just a little bit but now i'm going to start feeding there from the bottom which is what is recommended by this company to bottom feed so i'm gonna start doing that probably tomorrow okay guys so i'm gonna put her back in the tent but before you go I want to show you what conditions she's gonna be growing in okay guys so there she is I got a new 2x4 tent I'm really excited about that and I'm hoping to have three autos growing here I have of course the one that we just trained I also have another Gorilla Glue and in promix HP my what I normally grow in this one had some of the same issues but actually a little bit worse on this one so I'm not sure if maybe maybe it's the time of the year and the season perhaps I have higher iron in my water it looks like a rust and where it also happened to this one which is in the soil the living soil that has everything it needs I'm pretty sure it's something to do with my water itself but it again this one is starting to come out of it and hopefully that didn't hurt her too bad but I will be doing some training on this one also but not today and I also have a freshly sprouted early miss from crop king seeds these these two here these igloos they both came from I love growing marijuana calm I'm going to leave it link in the description for them the early myths came from crop king seeds and I will leave a link in the description for them also let's take more of a look at this chant here alright what's this that uh now I did the grow review on the TS 1000 and I loved it it was a huge hit I got about nine ounces off of a hundred and fifty watts for that TS 1000 so Myers hydro they were following along with my grow to just curiosity I guess and they were pretty impressed and asked me how I liked it I told him I loved it it's great they said hey you want to try out the SP 250 and I was like do I yeah yeah I do so anyway I got this in the mail last week and I was gonna do an unboxing on it but I was just I was just too too hyper I wanted to get it out of the box and put it in the tent so so Myers hydro it's the SP 250 and it fits a 2x4 perfectly so I get a 2x4 tent to fit it and I'm excited to see what this will do if I can get nine ounces off the TS 1000 out of at 150 watts I should be able to pull the pound off of this don't hold me to that because that would be because this will be the grow that is crappy and I don't get anything off because that's what I said I was going to get anyway we get what we get but I am super excited to try out the SP 250 per day it is a damn bright light it's got mostly white lights it's got you can see a few reds and blues and it also has UV and IR for help you know to grow it's also waterproof fanless as these fins here that act as heat sink I do have a rotating fan up here just over top of it just to help cool it but I mean that's that's cool there's nothing hot here the driver yes the driver is a little bit warm not bad with the fan on it's a little bit warmer than the TS but it's also drawing more power to so anyway super cool light I really like it can't wait to see what it will do okay guys so that's it for this one we have that the one gorilla glue train I'm going to train the other one and when we come back in a week or so we'll see how they're doing then so and see how this Myers hydro SP 250 is doing - I will have links in the description for Myers hydro and they've also yet this the code that they gave me to give to you guys for the TS 1000 Gro review they're continuing that on through this gross so that's awesome so I'm going to put a link to the Marge hydro calm down below if you want to order any light tent whatever on there use that code and it'll save you a few dollars ok guys so that's it for this one like share subscribe leave a comment down below check out my patreon I have a link of that down below - I do put on a few picture updates here and there just kind of a sneak peek of what's coming up so if you want to join that and you get a little bit of a look at some of this stuff alright guys we'll see you on the next one happy growling", "sYDwZ1Hlvd4": "[Music] one morning at the dawn of man a bunch of monkeys sat around in the sand it was heaven grooming picking fleas

not-for-profit sector my vision is for a global network of donors and grassroots beneficiaries working closely together since 1990 I've been involved in a range of charitable causes on three continents I presided over a string of successes these experiences have taught me a lot as a fund raiser I built relationships with some of the world's richest people before asking Bill Gates for 35 million dollars to save gorillas in perpetuity I prepared a solid business plan and a film featuring celebrity endorsements the entire appeal package was donor funded during my 17 years as director of the Dian Fossey gorilla fund I raised millions of dollars and I helped conceive develop and fund over 30 community-based projects in and around gorilla habitats in Central Africa one of the world's troubled regions our strategy was simple conduct a community survey to determine the reasons why people were encroaching the gorilla habitat and then team up with a local grassroots organization to address them in Rwanda honey collecting was a problem honey collectors were venturing into the forest to find wild hives and when they found them they were using bundles of burning sticks to smoke the bees out and then collect the honey occasionally fires got started with dire consequences for the gorillas so we brought in wooden hives and we teamed up with a Rwandan beekeeping NGO to teach the locals modern beekeeping techniques they were quick to appreciate that keeping a hive outside the park and letting just the bees go in was more sensible the result was more honey so we teamed up with a local honey Marketing Board and found a market for their surplus the truth is $5,000 given to a grassroots beneficiary working on the front line goes a lot farther than $30,000 given to an international organization when it comes to social change small is beautiful but it's also hard to find let me help you find the forest for the trees my experiences have given me valuable insights

Neil from perfect son LED calm and finally got you guys a new grow up grow update video it is uh the 15th right now and this was this one we recorded on the 8th and so I'll show you two different videos I have a video from today in a video from from like eight days ago whatever it was um so here we go this I'm gonna show you what with the four strains we got going that when we growing here and this grow then I'm gonna just show you guys will up data and then I'm finally finished with her actual update today's update alright so first off we have New York City diesel this is by advance seeds it's an auto flower so that's something we're doing three Auto flowers and then one photo period this time so hopefully these get big because these two are gonna be small hopefully this one gets big because these two are actually small strains I was doing a fourth a fourth one but it those seed grew like really curved and weird and then as I was impatient and as I was trying to pull it up it snapped so that one's gone but anyway so I don't think the gorilla glue is not very big this is guerrilla glue by fast bus and auto flour and this is afroditi I forget who does this one right now but anyway this is also not a flower these two don't get very big and so they'll take a very little room this one hopefully will get big New York City diesel auto has potential to get big from what I've seen I never never grew up before but it's supposed to be able to have pretty good potential but that's alright even if they don't get very big that's okay because the blue dream is gonna get very big and I'll need that room for blue dreams so and these were four days old at this time and then these two here the afroditi and this one is one day old I had some issues with seeds this time like anyway I talked about some of that before my my live videos well by the way if you want to catch me on my live shows I haven't been live in a little bit but I'm gonna be going live here again really soon anyway I've been going live on Twitch so follow me on Twitch it's grow pot cheaply so twitch TV slash grow pot cheaply I think I have the link in the description of this video as well so check that out and it's free to follow just go there and follow and then you'll get notified when I go live so yeah so in this one here is the photo period this is the blue drain by Humboldt seed so this will be the photo period that we're doing you'll notice that something I do I was going to make a live video on this but I didn't end up doing it was it feeling good so but nonetheless when you open up the when you open up the rock holder you cut it in half or you rip it in half when you put it back together and put the seedling in there I highly recommend if there's if there's seems like there's not enough space mashing between the peel off a little bit of the corner and smash in there and then put it back together again and sometimes you can see right here we put a little piece on the top just to kind of give it something to push up out if it hasn't already come out of the seed yet and so yeah that was that update you got some basil flowers right here let's go and look at the other one and so also you can check out her video here of this one as well I think I'm gonna going to sleeve her actual talking in it just a quick update of the of what's going on maybe I won't because it's really she just says kind of what they are so this is New York City Diesel now we're on day 11 this was filmed on the 15th and then over here we have guerrilla glue by fast but it's out of flour and afroditi and now you can see the blue dream has popped up so this is eight days later so these are now eight days old and these are now well three xi well I think these were seven days old and these would be eleven cuz they're forty as a part I think because this was that these were at one I'm either only three days apart nevermind eight nine ten yeah that's right so these are eleven days all these are eight days old and you can see that they're starting to uh starting to come in the gorilla glues growing a little funky so let's go and look at that real fast so let's go ahead and see here's the afroditi effort eat it looks really nice at eight days old you can see she has her next set of leaves here she has these big tree leaves here and she has next set looks like she has another set of true leaves coming in as well that's the afroditi I think she's gonna be really nice hopefully we'll see and notice that we keep them in here now you can also put them inside a humidity dome so sometimes we'll put the immunity dome on there for the first ten days depends how you know moisture is I usually like to keep them on there for the first ten days and also helps keep the rock wall from drying out so fast and you just water which is a little bit everyday at lesson less than a shot glass every day just a little bit for the first like ten days I like to use it's like a little bit liquid seaweed and then we start feeding axial nutrients which we need to start doing now let me look at seaweed is kind of a nutrient but it's more of a if you don't have liquid seaweed you can use any sort of bloom so whatever you're using just use the bloom for the first ten days and then after that switch over to grow until they start to flower so here's the Exodus go back your own juice you look at the blue drain now here's the blue gene so you see the blue dreams the the furthest behind which is fine because she's gonna end up taking off remember she's a photo period so it's usually be vegging this entire time that they're going so they're gonna go for a good probably eighty day so this thing's gonna be vegging for like 80 days so it's gonna get pretty big I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna top her and maybe start doing like a mainline mainlining it you know like top it where there's four tops left and then Bend each one over to left and right and like draw them out horizontally like this and then keep training him down and then then ask the new ones grow up train those branches down so I think that's what I'm gonna do and just keep it growing long like that and then a little bit a little bit some branches will grow out wide like this but for most part I'm trying to grow out long like this because I wanted to take up the full eight the full eight foot because remember I'm growing in eight by four area so eventually I want that to take up the whole eight by eight by four area if I if I can't I want to get to get so long that it grows up the walls now keep in mind so if you're if you're going from the center right and then you're you're splitting it out this way if you didn't grow it horizontally how how tall would that be so think about how tall this apply has to get if it's growing straight up so first off just take one side because that side that's going this way and that's how it's going that way it doesn't matter that's going horizontal that's still the vertical growth if you think about if I just let it go straight up right so that's growing four feet this way so four feet from the left and then it's going to be going up the wall a little bit so basically I have to grow as long as I can grow like a five foot tall plant which should be shouldn't be that difficult then as it's growing horizontally is goes four feet like this and that that would be like a four foot tall plant and then it starts going up the walls and that would be like a five foot tall plant that's that's the basic idea not as easy as it seems it depends you know how how much you trained to come down like that because remember I did the the critical haze like that well I'd let it kind of go up in a bush land he's kind of tied it down she didn't really stretch very much at all and because she didn't really have much stretch to her then we just kind of stayed that height and so it stretched almost to the to the wall so it was like maybe a six and a half foot wide plant instead of eight feet wide but anyway we'll see what happens I I pretty sure blue dream is supposed to stretch so if I if I grow her out to where she's almost touching the walls and then I flipped twelve twelve we should get it to go up the walls a little bit and there's the Afro Dida Sears the guerrilla glue you can see it looks a little bit strange it's got this kind of weird growth coming out here and here you can see a little bit of deficiency going on and these leaves probably sound a hard time up taking something whatever sis everything you know it's fine sometimes they get off to a weird start like that I can't be sure exactly what it is you know the pH and it was fine and everything so it might just be something strange with the plant see the little wrinkling here this isn't a good sign but I highly doubt it has anything in the root system yet because the roots are so that we were sorting them popping out of the rock well yet so I I doubt it has anything to do with that I don't I'm not sure what it is yet I'd have to look at it more closely but it should correct itself so I don't really pay too much attention and things like this it's not too big of a deal and you know it's why it's always a good idea if you if you know you need a you know you know you need a certain amount of plants to grow at least two or three more than what you need so that if one goes funky then you know you have you have back up there and then you just pick out the best ones of the bunch so once they all start veggie nicely then you just pick out the best ones the ones that are growing how you want it to you ditch the other ones just toss them out I know some people don't want to do that but if you really want to make sure you have the exact amount of plants you want get the best possible ones that's the way to do it if you're going with clones it's not a big deal because the clones are free right almost free I mean you took a little bit to grow them but anyway if there's seeds the seeds can be kind of expensive so you know you might not want to just toss them out which is a good good way a good reason why you can make your own you know using teresa smith's make your own auto flower seeds and do it that way and then here we got the New York City diesel again by advance seeds so it looks like right now the leaves already looking kind of like long so we'll see SCC has that kind of sativa growth to her and she starts getting bigger yes that's pretty much it that's the Gro update oh by the way so if you kind of see your Sears my AC back here for those who haven't seen my grow room in a while and then this right here is one of my 50 gallon what are these called again drums you can get plastic drums like that at let's see or you can get them at any pretty much any sort of farm store so I think the farm store we got it out where does that farm store called I can't run what it's called right now for some reason anyway it does pretty much any any type of like farm type store I came here the main one that we have but that's where that's what we got it at so they're like 50 bucks or some like that you can also order them on Amazon and it's not too bad with the prime I think you can find them on prime and I think and get them for like 70 80 bucks something like that maybe I'll give it a little bit cheaper than that that's kind of their kind of including prime you know shipping in the price that's why but if you absolutely can't find one locally then you can always you can always buy a drum placer drum online I like the ones with these twisty lids on it's just easy to get off and on but they have different kinds of lids but honestly that I don't ever put the lid down I could actually you know drill holes in the lid everything I make to make the make the hoses come out of that way and have it closed and airtight I just don't worry about it I just set it on there and I kind of set it I set it to where it's the hoses are coming out the side and just set it on the hoses and I said it turned away from the light so if you guys are the light I would set the lid away from you guys that way that kind of little exposed part is turned away from like see over here this is where it's opened up out on that side and then the sides where the light is that's why I have it down on the side where the light is and that's fine I mean I get very little algae growth even you screw the cap now every time you're still gonna get a little algae growth inside the tank you don't have to clean it regardless so this that makes these or just pull the lid off and you know do we got to do refill it repeat it put the lid back on its really simple instead how to unscrew it every time alright so yeah that's pretty much it and yeah so there you go we're gonna have three out of flowers hopefully the Gorilla Glue pulls through it looks like it's going to it might just be the seed sometimes I've seen just plans to do that for no apparent reason you know pH is fine and it's getting the right amount of food like everything is fine and then it just still just grows funky like that but hopefully it she'll turn out to be okay a lot to wait and see worst-case scenario we'll have two lot of flowers going and then this photo period but I think I think she'll pull through but yeah so three Auto flowers will be going on on the one side and then the gorilla macro blue the blue dream photo period on the other side in our 8 by 4 area and then as those Auto flowers start taking up this area then this in the blue dream will start getting bigger and bigger and then hopefully that will be soon enough area for the blue dream and not to overcrowd these ones it should be fine that's how it was last time you're we're good I think that for out of flowers going last time and then the critical but I had I couldn't train the critical down though because I don't have enough room so that's why I had to let the critical grow up so that's what only I'm worried about here is that if these auto flowers do end up taking too much room and I'm already starting to train the blue dream to come wide then once I run out of room I have to stop and have to wait you know for these to finish and then I then I can pull the blue drain to rest the way down so that it can be full you know anyway we'll see how it turns out so basically my do is I'm I I'm gonna train the blue dream to be flat and short and then if I run in a room I'll just let it start growing up from that point and then once those are done then I'll pull those branches back down as much as I can so that's that's the game plan so stay tuned for that I'll give you guys updates on all the all these girls so I think that New York City diesel hopefully should be a good-sized one I think it'll be alright remember we're only doing this to show you guys the different kinds of strains and remember last grow we had that duck going and then we had the gorilla or is it blueberry so both of those were both of those both of those were Otto flowers by Dutch passion and they got big got big they got like three and a half I need to duck up duck got like four feet tall maybe four and a half feet tall so they got big there was no training we just let him grow no training and they got pretty big I was kind of surprised and both of those yielded really well I think it was was eight ounces I'm like that it's in one of my live videos where I talk about the the weight we got out of them but I think one was like nine ounce as long as eight ounces maybe maybe did one reach ten I don't think it reached ten I think it was like eight and nine ounces anyway we're really really nice yields out of those things considering we weren't even trying to get big gilts those are in just regular pots they were like number three is whatever's they weren't very big pots and that's what we got out of it so it's really it's really crazy when you grow underneath the perfect Sun LED lights if you follow

however I was noticing that during the day we were still having slots available where I could be serving and more patients and I was very unsure of anything to do with online marketing in the past I had tried Facebook ads and Google AdWords however they didn't really work for me they didn't provide much return for the costs that was put up front for that and Shawn was already a patient of mine and he got in contact with me and had a meeting with me and from from there really we started to work together on putting together a campaign to fill up the empty spaces I was having with new patients because that's really what we wanted we wanted more traffic coming to the clinic in the form of new patients and I really did not know much about online marketing on how to target people by this medium and Shawn was a great help because he was able to come and visit and talk me through step by step the whole way the campaign was going to work out and what I would have needed to learn what he needed for me to do to get the ball rolling with that he provided excellent support and the whole time the campaign was going up I mean questions I had just emailed him that he got back to me straightaway okay and very easy to deal with and as a result of the campaign we were able to book in a lot more new patients and see a lot more people and close a lot more of the patients as well and the campaign turned out to be really successful I was very happy with us and I would definitely recommend sure", "ebFc0heKjBs": "yo straight up and down all my friends kept on sending me this video

everything but this is like a real life situation that she's going through this says sterile water for irrigation so i'm guessing what are those things those are oh nail polish remover pads so she got a whole bunch of nail polish remover pads and then she has a sterile water so i guess once she uses the nail polish remover then she will have to use a sterile water to make sure that her scalp doesn't get super irritated but yeah it's definitely going to be a long and hard process i don't even think if she was to shave it off that it would actually help her because it's literally stuck onto her scalp and it probably can be toxic i could imagine so again you know and she does have a gofundme so she's getting some funds if y'all want to help her out or whatever looks like she only was

smoothie we've been making this one for a while uh it's called the blue gorilla so we're going to start with chocolate protein this time so we'll go with a nice nice big scoop of protein here and it's blue gorilla gorillas like bananas so we're going to add some banana to this smoothie and to make it blue we're going to add some frozen blueberries i don't really make them out i just pour a bunch in and then of course we got to put some peanut butter in there love the peanut butter gives it a great flavor it also gives a little bit of a little bit of sweet salt the salt from the peanut butter tastes great because i have two different types of frozen fruit in here i'm probably not going to add ice today but i am going to add some vanilla unsweetened vanilla almond milk i don't again i don't measure it out i just add a fair amount throw this on here and let's go ahead and get it going all right i think we're all set let's pour this up and see what it looks like got a nice purple color

same weight at their adult age but their ways of living and their behavior is very different from each other unlike some animal rivals this tough pairing doesn't have an obvious outcome both the lion and the gorilla have their share of strengths each of which is unique lions are commonly known as the kings of the jungle people around the world consider the symbol of lions as the sign of strength and power they are the world's second largest cat after the tiger they are the social cats and live together in groups called prides the characteristic silver hairs on the backs of some mountain gorillas indicates they are adult males as extremely powerful silverback gorillas live mostly in the jungles that surround African mountain ranges to sustain a body that size silverback gorillas need to eat a lot of food every day and make sure they get all the right nutrients into their systems size and description the lion is the only cat exhibiting sexual dimorphism which means that male and female lions look different from each other males are larger than females a lion's body ranges in length from 4.5 to 6.5 feet 1.7 to 2 metres with a 26 to 40 inch tail 0.6 to 1 metre weight runs between 265 to 420 pounds a hundred and twenty to a hundred and ninety kilograms lion cubs have dark spots on their coat when they are born which fade until only faint belly spots remain in adulthood adult lions range in color from buff to gray to various shades of brown both males and females are powerful muscular cats with rounded heads and ears only adult male lions display a brown rust or black Mane which extends down the neck and chest only males have dark tail Tufts which conceal tail bone spurs in some specimens Silverbacks are very large when they stand upright they are from 5.5 to 6 feet tall 1.7 to 1.9 meters and weigh as much as 350 pounds a hundred and sixty kilograms the Silverbacks ears look small for its head males have a large boney crest on the tops of their skulls and back which help support their jaw muscles and teeth the bony crest gives their heads a conical shape females have the same crest as well but it is not as pronounced as it is in males Silverbacks are also very hairy they are the hairiest of all gorilla species their hair is long and thick and helps to insulate them at high elevations Silverbacks get their silver saddle at around 12 years old younger males who don't yet have the silver saddle are called black backs range and habitat African lions have a number of subspecies separated by large lioness expanses historically Lions could be found across the vast majority of Africa but their current range has been restricted to a smattering of locations in central and southern Africa outside of Africa Lions used to be found from Greece all the way to India humans slowly decimated these populations over the centuries apparently only a small population of the Asiatic Lion subspecies can be found in the gear forest National Park in western India lions prefer grassland and savanna habitats in close proximity to water sources such as rivers they also prefer hunting in open areas rather than densely packed forests Lions are absent from all rainforest habitats in their range Western or lowland gorillas inhabits the forests of Equatorial Africa from the west and lowlands near the Cameroon coast through the Central African Republic Equatorial Guinea Gabon Nigeria Republic of Congo Angola and possibly the Democratic Republic of Congo Africa's tropical secondary forests where the open canopy allows much light to reach the forest floor provides the best habitat for Western gorillas diet Lions are carnivores which means they eat meat in the wild Lions prey usually consists of wildebeest zebra and various ungulates like giraffes buffalo and gazelles occasionally Lions will hunt young elephants rhinoceros or hippopotamus Lions also scavenge food chasing away hyenas and other carnivores from their kills Lions are known to be opportunist feeders and will also eat rodents small birds hares and reptiles a lion chasing its prey can run the length of a football pitch in six seconds Lions eyes have a horizontal streak of nerve cells which watch their prey carefully across the plains gorillas are primarily vegetarians and feed along the edges of dense forests however they do eat whatever insects and small animals are on the leaves and stems they consume gorillas also will eat crops and rotting wood Silverbacks consumed 45 pounds of food every day behavior lions are primarily nocturnal or crepuscular lions spend much of their time resting often up to 20 hours per day during periods of rest Lions have many opportunities for social behavior they gather and sleep in groups rubbing their heads together and playing life in a group allows Lions to hunt for food together female lions of a pride may spread out around potential prey to attack it from many directions despite their tremendous power and adaptive efficiency Lions are more likely to fail than succeed in their attempts to kill mountain gorillas are highly social animals who live in family groups referred to as troops led and protected by a dominant silverback three to four sexually mature females one or two younger male gorillas and 3 to 6 juveniles and infants form this cohesive family subordinate Silverbacks might also be part of a troop they are most often the younger brothers or adults sons of the dominant silverback a large mountain gorilla troop can exceed 20 individuals now let's see finally who would win a fight between a lion and a silverback gorilla the gorillas large canines are designed not for flesh but for intimidation and they still pale in comparison to the predatory teeth of its opponent the male lion the silverback gorillas arms are extremely strong and even if it doesn't have lion like claws they have the ability to use makeshift weapons using the trees and rocks around them should a lion dare to attack a silverback head on he can use his powerful throwing force to land a serious and possibly fatal blow unlike the silverback gorilla the lion is a predator by nature while they may not share the same level of intelligence the lion wields a body built for hunting the Lions fearsome claws can also rake wounds into the gorilla even as it struggles against the Lions jaws the lion despite its predatorial strengths leans upon an assassin's technique due to his low stamina he depends heavily upon a stealthy approach in order to take down his foe in a single strike finally I believe the odds are in the gorillas favor if the lion can get in close enough and score an accurate bite he could end the fight before it even begins however a gorilla is a mighty foe with more stamina and fearsome strength its will to fight will last much longer than a male lions but if it gets its hand upon a solid branch it can put a beating on its feline combatant so long as the silverback manages to evade a Lions bite and its scratches remain superficial he can use his powerful punches and throws to score a hit that will lay the lion low that's all for today thank you so much for watching and please

would not suggest this twist out no long-term styling hi guys welcome back to my channel my name is ebony if you are new here then o welcome to my corner of the YouTube universe and if you're old here and then hey guys welcome back don't forget to click that subscribe button down below so you don't miss any more videos from me and thumbs up the video if you find it helpful and without further ado let's jump into it so today I'm gonna be doing something a little bit different I wanted to do a review and comparison but this is kind of more like a first impressions and comparison of the gorilla snack gels so I am gonna go over some details about the products this is the popular one here on YouTube among the natural community because it has the strongest hold and this one is also something I wanted to try out because it has a softer hold and it's just different my mom got these for me from Walmart I think there were three dollars each or like 350 each or something like that and something I forgot to mention is that it's 350 for eleven point nine ounces or almost twelve ounces really like I mean extremely affordable and something I didn't know about this brand is that it's Mexican or at least manufactured in Mexico the labels are in Spanish so mo coded gorilla is actually the name of the product which translates to gorillas not but it doesn't actually say that on here in English and a lot of other labeling on the packaging is in Spanish which is fine you know I took a bit of Spanish okay I don't know everything that it's saying on the back here and you can definitely read the directions online in English it's pretty Universal like using hair gel you know so yeah I wanted to try these out for you guys but this is my first time using them and I just wanted to see how they would perform so yeah let's jump into it hey guys this is one certain office and I'll twist out like huge and I'm just gonna part off sections here in the front they don't have to be exact look this is just basically the hair I'm gonna be working with I thought about using ponytail holders like scrunchies but then I ended up just going with bobby pins so I am wetting my hair here applying some Jamaican black castor oil I didn't want to put any more cream on my hair because I felt like it already had product in it from when I did my twist out and I'm just smoothing that in because I heard that this job was drying so I want to make sure something's underneath it so the yellow will be going on the right side but it's left here in the video and it's very tacky and sticky but going on to my hair was very smooth and slimy and I'm just smoothing that aim I am an equal-opportunity slicker so no hair left behind and taking some bobby pins to set it in place I did not use a brush I do not tie down my edges I didn't feel like it was necessary because I wasn't really going anywhere today so this is just keeping my hair out of my face and the red one is gonna be on the left but it shows as the right and it is not a sticky coming out the jar so I'm just applying that here making sure the sideburns are snatched and sitting that in place with a bobby pin as a well and this is what everything is looking like I'm just gonna go about my day but so far so good it looks kind of white here cuz of the shine from my lights but it does dry clear this is what the yellow gel looks like right out the bottom and this is what it looks like after its dried down for about five minutes so it gets a lot tackier and gummy ER and sticky and this is the red one right out the bottle it shows his white at first but it dries clear and this is how its acting after about five minutes as well also very tacky and sticky so these are the final results here I'll just lean in here this is what everything is looking like I have had this in my hair for about four hours so it is completely dry down or hardened this is the side where I had the red here on my left side and this is the side where I had the yellow and my hair is pretty hard because I didn't brush it in or because I didn't tie my edges down it's like the top layer of my hair is hard but up underneath it it's still pretty soft but this stuff is crunchy it was sticky going on but it is pretty crunchy now if you wanted something to get frozen in place I mean and stay there forever I would suggest the yellow one the red one still has a very similar hold again the yellow one this one is a hold of ten is what they're saying and the red one is a hold of nine so the hold is pretty similar I don't even know why he would make a hold that close together on there and if you look closely to the little guys on the labels hopefully you guys can see those but this guy his hair is standing completely up and this guy on here his hair is like not completely standing up and the yellow is the punk and the red is the rocker Oh or the rocker ooh wrecker oh I don't think one is better than the other unless it has to do with application going on I felt like this one wasn't as sticky but the hold is like almost exactly the same so I don't see the difference in the yellow versus the red in my hair again I also put the Jamaican black castor oil underneath so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it but in my head they're performing the same seeing is how I did put the Jamaican black castor oil underneath both of them and they still came out hard as a rock I would highly recommend that you put something anything moisturizing on underneath before you put in the gorilla snot I would also recommend that whenever you style your hair with this stuff only leave it in for like one or two days and then wash your hair like one or two days before wash day and then wash it out like I'm about to do my wash day is tomorrow so would not suggest leaving this in the long term but it works man it it's staying it is like a hardcore stand I would not suggest this for a wash and go I would not suggest this twist out no long-term styling no long-term styling I really probably would only do this to slicked down my edges I wouldn't use this on the rest of my hair either this stuff also left my hair very shiny because everything is so frozen it's just it's very shiny which I am pretty sure is one of the claims that I read on their website and I did not receive any flaking which is also one of the claims their website so that's a plus but this stuff has all of my baby hairs snatched them them things are snatched but for the price point and for the effectiveness of it I would still highly recommend this product if you're looking for something more natural I wouldn't suggest this but if you don't care then girl it is what it is now as far as a fragrance is concerned I don't remember what other product smells like this to me this is gonna bother me oh this is gonna bother me it smells exactly like another product I've tried before and I can't put my finger on it it is a light sweet perfume me it's not strong at all fragrance and after it gets in your hair like you it completely dries and you don't smell it whatsoever but they do both have the same fragrance I would highly suggest these I mean they are very effective they're extremely affordable they're pretty accessible and I mean it just it works the only thing is that I would do this for like instant styling something that you're gonna do for like a day no more than 24 to 48 hours and then wash it out getting this stuff off of my hands it seemed to have mixed with water like relatively easily and just like come right off so I don't think we're gonna have a problem on wash day trying to get this out but it is pretty sticky going on that much I will say this Mexican hair gel is pretty dope I like it I suggested I think you guys should go get some this will probably last me for the rest of time I don't know when it expires but it would probably expire before I used it all like I said this is like it's like hair insta freeze this of it like it will keep your hair every hair every baby hair every full grown hair every adult middle-aged postmenopausal elderly military hair in place okay and I'm not mad at it it's time around I probably would use a brush and set it with the scarf but because I wasn't going anywhere like special or specific today I didn't feel the need to do that so yeah you sparingly but would recommend anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you enjoyed this first impression so don't we give a thumbs up if you find it helpful or if you want me to do any more of these like first

and if you then I will see you in the next one bye guys", "y18Hb9KM5bs": "hello i'm sheri clergus with app 45 when life changes and i'm so excited that you've joined us today and i have the most interesting and actually amazing guests today we're going to have a fun conversation i can tell but we're also going to dive deep into how do you get movies made because it's something that i have had no idea about but i've always wanted to be a movie star so today i am so excited to have robin rosencrantz and michael clover in 1990 they quit the la scene stole all their possessions except for their guitars and got a one-way ticket to europe and then they had just an amazing journey and through that time they've been creating movies and uh they just recently launched a new one 36 husbands which i had the opportunity to watch it's just hilarious and so welcome thank you we're happy to be here i love your backdrop yeah that's our that's our capitalism going on available on itunes amazon's supposed to hypnotize you well actually we had a lot of fun um designing the poster we had a great photographer in los angeles taking pictures of the actresses that you see behind us and then we took the design to our distributor in paris and they had a designer in the office there i made a poster and they said no it's terrible michael it's so great because michael is really self-taught at everything and you can tell when you see what i do no but he really impresses me he's always learning new skills so i like his posters but but i do think they improved upon his design ideas and i i think i think this is the best poster of our of our seven films it's the one i'm happiest with and i think it really describes the movie and it's just fun and you know you you want something that will stand out especially on those little thumbnails that they have on itunes so we hope that people will be drawn to it well i i thought after watching the movie it really suited the movie you know it had the same vibe to it for sure are you old enough to remember the monkeys oh yes that was a vibe i was trying to go for well pretty close mrs peel do you know who that is mrs peel from the 60s avengers it was a spy show with a guy named steed and the first you know kick butt woman character on tv called mrs peel she was kung fu it was english but that was the the mix of those two kind of mrs peale meets the monkeys that was kind of what i was the vibe i was trying to go well i also got the vibe of like get smart uh yeah yeah it gets my program in there yeah yeah absolutely nice so tell us a bit about your personal journey and how you came to produce this movie and i'm just gonna be quiet because there's two of you so i want you both to be able to talk so why are we here what happened how do we get here well um ever since i was a kid i knew that i wanted to be a musician that was just something i think i was i was born with wanting to sing wanting to play guitar wanting to write songs at one point i thought i wanted to be the first female astronaut but that didn't happen but i never dreamt that i would be producing movies you know i've always loved movies i grew up watching movies and and tv and it's just magical how a movie you know takes you on a journey but um movie making really happened organically and uh we'll we'll get into that a little bit later organically you mean like manure like organic tofu honey oh okay but um basically i i pretty much got my training in the music world and uh you know writing songs but i think you produced a video oh that you know that's that was the first thing she did an anti-drunk driving video you know in the 80s wasn't it yeah you're right that was a big production yeah a music video again that's where you're learning you're right i totally forgot about that thanks for reminding me yeah sure i'm your pr guy and my husband and my everything and my cook and i vacuum and you know how to fix cars [Laughter] i think you better keep them i think so 30 years so far so good 30 years we're just still newlyweds right 30 years this year congratulations what i think has been neat about our journey like sherry you were saying you know we we quit our jobs in l.a sold everything we had bought one-way tickets to europe and we had this dream to travel and play music but we had no idea what was going to happen i i have to interject that when you say we sold everything we have people think oh they sold their house and the car where they probably would raise 150 000 we raised 408 dollars that was how much seriously that's how much we raised at the garage sale to go to europe with right but it was enough for two one-way tickets exactly we were totally crazy which was kind of neat but we knew one guy in holland so so we landed in amsterdam you know we started there but the thing is i think the journey that we took really trained me to become a movie producer because i had to learn how to do everything by doing you know i couldn't take a class on this or read a book on how to book a tour how to promote a tour how to find a place to stay how to promote the shows you know where are we gonna where are we gonna sleep the next night just like all these things i had to learn along the way and i kind of um learn by putting a detective hat on it's like yeah i remember you were always with posters whenever we'd be we were in holland and robin we'd be walking down the street there she see a poster a concert wait hold on she'd look and find who's doing it where is it what's the name of the place you know she was always then she'd go home and try to call them and you know it was just like constant research right right we couldn't walk 20 feet without stopping and taking are you going to stop again yeah i remember but she yeah she became a really good booking agent the she booked the first tour she booked in holland was like 50 shows 5-0 and uh with good venues and then an agent discovered us because of that a dutch agent saw the list on the in the music magazine and said who books you guys and we said robin does he said not anymore you know so he took over we were with him for like 15 years right yeah but it but it was like again i had to learn by doing out of um survival and passion for wanting to live as an artist because not die of starvation right that's a motivator absolutely but the thing is when we when we were first over there you know we we you know just got gigs by walking in into a club saying hey we're singer songwriters from los angeles can we play a show you know we met one person they said oh do you need a place to stay they invite us in like one thing leads to another but at a certain point we were kind of about to run out of money and michael's like maybe we should go back to los angeles i'm like i'm not going home i came here to have a career and i love being in europe and i was kind of like you know you've been lived a sheltered life you've never been broke before i know what it's like to not have money so i was pretty freaked out right but she said we're not going back if you want to go back go back without me because i'm gonna i'm gonna book a tour i'm gonna book a tour okay okay okay calm down i'll learn how to write so i spent that summer while robin was on the phone booking the tours this is 1990 we're talking about she she was booking the first tour getting a lot of no's she was calling 50 places 60 places to get one gig you know and then but she was like a bulldog and i was learning how to write in the back with i had a little thing called a laptop which was like the size of a toaster oven you know it was 1990 right so this giant laptop which you could barely pick up and i was in the backyard writing stories and stories and plays and all kinds of journals yeah again self-taught and then you know this is before internet so i literally no no no not before no that was it was it was just not that really yeah 80s 80s it was in the 80s yeah but it wasn't popular it was there since the 80s trust me oh okay we weren't using it but but the thing was so i had this music magazine and i was looking for venues and i was making phone calls okay it was before cell phones and no it wasn't before we just didn't have one yeah i know it looks like walkie-talkie if you watch there's a there's an 80s film with uh what is it called the wall street no it's it's uh maybe it's called wall street it's with michael douglas oh right he plays you know gekko gordon gekko i forget what it's called i think that's the name and there's a part where they were showing off the technology and he picks up this thing that's like a shoe box he goes hi bob yeah i'm calling you on my cell phone it was at the time it was so cool that now if you see that movie it's hilarious right not cool we didn't have one of those but you know i would it was funny because we were living with my friend in holland arletta albers a dancer an artist and so i would call up and most of the people in holland you know speak english a few don't some of the older people don't but i would call up and i'd say you know hello this is robin with bright blue gorilla i said it really slow they'd understand and um i knew a little bit of dutch i'd say a little bit of dutch to them they're like i speak english so i talk to them but this is before cds so i had to say okay okay but i had to send out cassette tapes right to the post remember those right yeah it wasn't like send a digital link and you know find out if we can play but i it was a miracle i ended up booking 50 shows as michael said and richard thompson yeah and richard thompson we were opening for richard thompson that was the that was the the gig that she got really cool i saw that he was playing all these clubs so i'm like i'm gonna call and see if we can be his opening act wow we got a bunch of shows with him yeah so this was all just like do it yourself and you know we're living with a friend we're living with this dancer that we know in a you know we had one room in her house and she's really nice because we're really broke so it's like we're just staying there and you know paying for groceries and stuff that's pretty much been the story of the whole trip the whole 30 years we never quite got into the hey we're rolling in the dough we still always stay with people we we occasionally get a hotel when a club pays for it kind of thing but usually we don't we usually stay with people yeah and that's really nice i tell you if you if you spend enough time spending you know spending time with the average person in all these different countries it really changes your perspective you realize you know what we're okay it's gonna be all right there's good people everywhere you watch tv and you think everybody's a nut and it's like no they're not actually those are the nuts that get on tv that how at a tv broadcast today a very nice person did a favor for a friend and then picked him up at the airport when he didn't need to you know it's like they wouldn't do that it's not exciting yes it's not newsworthy but yeah that's been a really special part of the journey getting to know people all around the world staying with them getting to know them getting to know their kids it's like we have families and friends all over the world and that's been a joy yeah and then like every time you know we're booking another tour whether it's a year or two years later a lot of times we go stay with the same people we're going to that town to play a cinema or music club in that town so we some of those people we've known for 30 years and we've seen their kids grow up and yeah i just want to give a caveat because it sounds really cool we're talking about but it most people could just couldn't handle it because exactly here's an example monday night you're playing at the fritz phillip auditorium in eindhoven so they put you up at the five-star hotel which is fantastic with a great breakfast buffet terrific and of course you put extra fruit in your bag and everything and unfort this really happened and unfortunately when i'm checking out the bag fell and opened up and all the stuff rolls out but anyway that's monday tuesday night you're playing at a student venue for students and they're putting you in with with franz who has not done his laundry in six months and it's piled up in the room where you're staying i'm serious and that's like that's and then wednesday it's somewhere in between so it's like it's really like this now robin and i we we practice yoga meditation and that's a big part of the whole thing how we've survived this and there's a whole concept of even-mindedness in in yoga meditation i'm not talking i'm not talking about the pretzel yoga where you pretzel yourself up meditation talking about the meditative raja yoga and then they're really even-mindedness it's very important because then you really enjoy something and then you surreal something's really bad and either one is kind of like you're not going like this you're kind of like hey cool that's fine that's kind of how we've dealt with it well i think that you have to be like that because you know lots of people are are in the mode of like i get up you know i brush my teeth here's my top you know here's the pan i use every day so going from that could be may it make a lot of people feel off kilter so you guys really are doing something special by adopting that lifestyle yeah it's been great training and you know we we found that over all those years whenever we sat down to meditate we felt at home yeah that was that was our anchor so it's the anchor inside us and even sometimes you get really busy you know you you do a show you get home late at night you've got to get up early catch the train get to the next venue so sometimes we'd be meditating on the train sometimes you're backstage you know doing your energy exercises getting grounded for to go on stage and catching a meditation when you can but that's really been our thread the whole time and it's really kept us anchored you know and and enjoying the experiences they come and it's you know full of mystery and surprises which has been really exciting and fun and a lot of new input and stimuli and new people it's a very different perspective if you have the consciousness that you are a not the body you're in the body like you're in a car yeah you know and at some point you're going to get out of the car and go somewhere else and then probably unless you're really advanced get into another body and learn some more stuff it's a very different experience if you if you recognize you're an eternal an eternal being not the body you're this thing inside and that all the stuff you're getting is just experiences to learn from that's really the essence of yoga meditation and the philosophy behind it and if you take it that way also knowing about karma you know what you give out comes back so knowing those things you you're more careful about how you behave and then you're also appreciating the great stuff and you're realizing the bad stuff what is what is this for me why is this what's my life what is the lesson here why did i attract myself to this that kind of thing and it's it's that's without that i really don't think we would have lasted more than a year or two you know i think it would have been too much but it's it's actually really pretty neat we were talking to a a great yogi that we know in in india and brother vishwanatha oh yeah and and we were talking about the touring life and he said it's perfect for the yoga path you're on because there's a thing the sadhus wandering saudis it's an ancient tradition where they were not allowed to stay in in one place more than three days because so that you don't form too many attachments that was their particular way that they walked the path and he it's kind of similar it's in a way it's weird because we don't have very much only what we can carry and we go from place to place to place place usually we're staying a couple of days and sometimes we're like right now we're homesteading with robin's parents you know so this is an unusual period for us we've been here for for almost a year with the covid thing right taking care of robin helping robin's parents yeah plus we're not just touring right now so but it's great too because now we're learning it in a different way this whole different kind of life yeah so i'm amazed so you've been doing this since 1990. you've been living this lifestyle it isn't something that you just did and then things sort of changed this is the lifestyle that you have yeah for 30 30 years we just celebrated our 30th year as bright blue gorilla on on the road and we want to we're talking you know because robin's dad is 91 robin's mother's 97 87 and so we're we're you know helping them out around the house and stuff just to make things easier for them while we're here it's we always enjoyed living with them whenever we're not on tour we come home and we stay here for usually just six weeks or two months and then we go back on the road but now this has been a longer period but whenever they go to the great beyond whenever that is we're gonna get back on the road we think or we might do what is called the fourth ashrama in yoga philosophy which means it's basically retirement but it's not retirement like hey i'm gonna go bowling and fishing it's like you pull back from the world and you focus completely entirely on your practice and your spiritual really get ready for the to get rid of all the rest of the stuff you're carrying and to move so that you move on cleanly that's that's called the fourth ashwam it's a neat concept so we're even thinking about maybe we'll go live in india for a while and uh you know serve there we're not sure when we'll do that but maybe it's coming up we'll see yeah yeah it's interesting i mean we're we'll always be artists and we love creating art but we're not you know doing it because we want to be famous or make a lot of money you know we're driven we have to you know but it's we enjoy it it's been an amazing journey we like to create uplifting music and movies hoping to up um people around the world that's always been our goal but you know we don't have this drive like we've got to make it we've got to break through and it's like it's like a rat wheel when we were going that we were moving when we first met for sure we were like really driven and you know rock stars yeah i wanted to be a rock star i wrote that in my 12 year old autobiography in school i want to be a rock star i actually probably have it in my mom and dad i knew it when i saw the i'm dating myself when i saw the beatles on the ed sullivan show i was with my my brother and sisters and i was really super young but i was old enough to you know talk and understand things and i was like what are those girls you know because they had like long hair you know which is like this you know they're like dude and then they were like no they're guys they're a band and i said that's their job because like you can do that that's a that's an option you know i don't know if something really rang a bell on that one and that was for sure i knew exactly that i'm going to be i'm going to be on stage singing and shaking my head you know so there's oh go ahead no go ahead i'm done well i just have so many questions like as i'm listening to your talk so so one thing that comes to mind is like what countries have you not been to or or what countries have you been traveling all over the world we have we've not been to africa yet we haven't been to africa i think we've been invited there a couple of times yeah we haven't been to japan japan our records have been out there and our movies are released yeah we have japanese subtitles amazing but you know and we've we've gone to china yeah we went to a film festival in china which was really interesting um the thing is because it's mostly been the two of us like running the whole company that can you call it a company i know but you know it's called a company on our tax return but that's about as companies yeah that's true but we haven't you know maybe gotten to as many countries as we wanted to because i was like busy booking the tour in some of the countries that we've been to before because i knew i could get gigs because you got to pay your way somehow right but i it would have been nice to uh you know get to more places though so many places we went to were really interesting and um been around europe a lot like the denmark and sweden and a little bit of eastern europe but not too much yeah mostly western europe yeah so is there a place that's your favorite gosh i don't know you know our my favorite place is kind of where i am as long as it's not freezing cold yeah we like to be warm well don't come to canada in december right now but every place is really special i think again the like being yogi's the tradition is really living in the moment being in the moment enjoying where you are not thinking about where you're not so i think i think that's something that's the way we've lived we've had to live that way too because we had to really take care of today what are we doing today and you make plans of course you have to be practical yeah you make some plans you know some medium-term longer-term plans but then there's a lot of like letting it flow and a lot of improvisational uh behavior that needs to come when you're especially when you're living a lifestyle like this because we're not buying our way through we're like hey oh i'm gonna rent this place here's oh what you need a thousand bucks here you go boom no problem you know we were like you know we just did a show and we're so we got a couple hundred bucks in our pocket kind of thing and like we've got to get through the next month so you know so we're oh you want to stay with me sure but then 99 of the time that's always been fine there's been only a couple times you can literally count on one hand in 30 years when it wasn't a great situation to stay we had to like like say you know thanks a lot we're going to split yeah but literally less than one hand's worth of bad experiences i would say in 30 years the rest of it has just been one remarkable thing after another another interesting thing about being the traveling person that's not from there that's approachable friendly and and traveling people tell you all kinds of stuff that they never tell anybody because they're afraid to tell you know and they always you know i never told you i always wanted to be a poet or something you know we get this from from like a guy that works at the bank you know and he's like yeah we're staying in his house yes well let me show you my stamp collection a little bit later and i'd say oh i've got some very interesting new ones from south africa with a broken uh broken post mark on there now look at this one it's interesting you can see where the mag don't look at the magnifying glass see the nose now see curves to the left your improv training is kicking in so that kind of guy and then when his wife leaves him he goes you know i always wanted to be a tango dancer but i never was like well you should do that you don't want you do that bob you know come on what is what's stopping you you know and then the nice thing is a lot of times we hear that they ended up learning tango and stuff all he needs sometimes is somebody just to say that's not a dumb idea somebody doing good idea and somebody somebody to listen i mean that's really been one of the most beautiful parts of the lifestyle is the time to like hang out with people we're all so busy in especially in the western world right so so yeah but so stain was somebody we found is the best way to get to know them yeah how often do you stay at your friend's homes right you meet for dinner for two hours or something but living with somebody whether it's for a night or two or three or a week and that's been just so special getting to hang out and talk and share and be a part of somebody's life you know and listen and uh it's almost like being on a new date every couple days yeah everyone's on their best behavior yeah you know it's like yeah it's like a play date it's because you're not dating so it's real innocence like your friends you know so it's like but it is the the nice excitement of that without all this weird attachment of the dating thing you know yeah if it was just a friendly get-together that's usually more fun because you don't have any strings attached okay that was great guys see you later you know right but but i think so asking what are some of our favorite places i think italy we like well italy but also one thing i really enjoy eating in italy sounds good but one thing i've really enjoyed is we've been to india six times that's good for eating too you know except it has a little side effect of eating oh my god what happened what did i eat different bacteria you know it's just a whole new ballgame that part's not fun but but our but our goal in india was um especially like the first time we went we said you know what we're going to unplug for six months in india we're going that wow and even though we love our career we love making music and movies what would happen if we just unplugged and just traveled and and just to be and take time to write and read and you know not do a career who are you when you're not doing your career even though we're artists and we love what we do so that was just an incredible experience we went for six months we've been six times doing doing that for like five or six months at a time usually but the first time was was weird because i i've been working since i was 11 seriously earning money because my mom was a single mom she was trying to sell life insurance support thing trying to support me and my brother and you know barely making our electricity was turned off so many times i can't tell you her phone turned off and stuff when i was a kid so if i needed something like you know like a baseball glove or something i had to get the money and so my friend next door was a there were republicans that lived next door very good with money and all all their kids worked and so we i became friends with the kid and we were like i mowed lawns and stuff i was 11. mow lawns did this did that so i pretty much never stopped working until india was the first time that i wasn't working and it was it was weird like well if i'm not what am i doing if i'm not if i'm not a musician i'm not performing what who am i really great i'm even though what was the answer like i'm really curious so i'm no one that's the answer i'm nothing unless i'm working no the answer was that that's all just busy busy busy stuff that's the thing we get so identified with our what we're doing and that's part of the lessons of the covid lockdown for a lot of people is there they've taken away a lot of the distractions even if it's work you know and you're earning money it's still it's it's it's putting your attention on something other than yourself and your own inner issues you're dealing with something else and when you neglect the inner life the real you for too long which is most of us right when you first look inside you go oh my god i'm a mess you know at first you are but then like take it easy it's all right you're gonna work it out and then you know after a while of working on the interior life it started smooths out like cleaning a room you know if you never cleaned your house for like 35 years and you're 35 years old and you turned around and looked at the mess oh my god where do i start right but then if you okay well let's start here move this move that move this and it slowly it gets to be more pleasant and then you can be with yourself without being distracted so much and it's it's actually because listen in just back to yoga the self with a capital s is god that's what they call god the self they call this the little self with a small s so the self goes within and connects with the self that's what they call it because it's the self of everything that's the yoga philosophy and so when you're clearing house enough and if you're actually able to go into that door and get into communion with the great spirit that animates everything it's that's pretty interesting you get into soul consciousness right where the real joy is and uh your intuition awakens and then you can draw things to you that you need in your life you didn't know this was gonna be a revival meeting did you no but i can i identify so well because i don't know if you've ever heard of the book the power of now um yes i have i've not read it but i've heard the title amazing book cons on that theme and it actually changed my life because i think i was a typical person who who you know a busy mom a career a wife um since i've been young taught you know to do things for other people and then all of a sudden one day it was like i had no idea who i was no idea right and that book sort of speaks to that and it did change my life it put me on a whole different journey so that's wonderful wonderful going going for six months in india sounds just so nice it is but again it's india it's the noisiest most polluted horriblest place in the world and the most beautiful friendly kindest place in the world it's both on the same day in the same hour well in my mind i'm thinking eat pray love you know that asheron that uh she she went to yeah yeah that's that's what i'm thinking india is like but i'm sure it's much wilder if you're julia roberts it is like that but if you're if you're going with a normal budget that it's not like that you're like yeah i remember taking the second class trains around india and you can travel across the length of the canada for like a dollar fifty you know it's like and so but you're sitting there in the second class car with like people are women are coming in with these packages of like dried sardines and a burlap sack on their head and you'll you'll be sitting there reading and suddenly you'll smell sardines they'll turn around there's like six women walking with the sardines and they bluff they lay them down that sardine dust goes all over the place and then you're smelling incense beautiful yeah sands it but the interesting thing is because of that the average person there at least the the middle middle class lower class people are really tolerant they're so used to noise they're so used to crowds weird things and the upper class is a different whole different animal and i have some issues with some of their behaviors of the upper class but that's just my you know my comrade stuff coming out but but people with so little want to share what they have with you right so we'd be you know we'd be on a seat on the train where maybe three people are supposed to sit there four people and there's seven people everybody's like crazy if somebody else comes they just scoot over make more so right but they want to they put like their baby on your lap hold the baby okay they want to share their dinner with you and just a lot of very a lot of sweetness there a lot of sweetness there yeah and help you and if you're asking for directions they'll walk you to where you're trying to go and go out of their way to help you into trouble there fortunate yeah but it was just it it's nice to like slow down you know especially in the western world we move so fast and that's why you know the whole lockdown stay at home thing it's not that hard for us i mean you know our lives are usually so exciting we're on the go we have all this input and now we're just being more still more quiet and we're getting to meditate a lot more and read our spiritual lessons and you know just fill up the tank and get more fuel and feel more anchored and serving and serve my parents and that's really nice and it just yeah it feels really good right now just uh just to be simple and still and uh joe biden says by christmas we may be somewhat back to normal i don't know he doesn't say for sure but so enjoy this while you can the quiet yes no it's nice in l.a there's no there was no traffic that was that was great three hours took and took you know 45 minutes or something to get there it was yeah there's some nice things and you probably read those nice stories about the the the canals of uh venice months ago the dolphins came back and the water the people like oh the water's blue i didn't know no there is there are many good things that have come to us through covet and sad to say but um you know there's a lot of challenges but so many good things too so so because your lifestyle is definitely not um you know built on on the financial aspects or or or money hungry kind of approach you're making movies which is i think typically a very expensive proposition so so how how do how do these movies get funded that's a good question like how do we make seven films right really yeah yeah and well the thing is first of all a lot of people spend a lot of money to go to film school to learn how to make films but again our approach was do it yourself learn by doing we're going to make a lot of mistakes along the way each movie's going to get better so we just bought a camera you know and we said michael's a writer a lot of our friends are actors let's just make a movie let's just do it you know and and and we'll have to learn how to produce and cast and cater already yeah i used to work for the tv show the osborne's i was one of the yeah editors i was the daily editor on from tv osborne's and it's the lowest editor on the totem pole but it was it was still i was there and i i met a lot of great editors and learned a lot from them so i was able to edit our work as well so that saves basically how do we do it it's like you either with in in the way that the world seems to work you either have money or you have agreement right if i if i ask you can you take me to the airport and you say yeah okay that's an agreement and then i don't need to get a taxi and spend a hundred dollars and then i say thanks so much and you say you're welcome and then if you needed ride and i could i would give you a ride so it's like but it's not a tit for tat it's just like you do stuff and you ask and if somebody can't so we say to someone who owns like let's say a a warehouse or something we say can we shoot a couple of scenes in here because it looks really great and they say when and they'll say well when when could when is convenient they said well we're not open on sunday and i'd say well could we shoot on sunday you know and yeah okay do you you know and you because they know how we work most people know that we're artists and we're not you know we're not well financed in any stretch of the imagination so what we end up spending most of the money on is food feeding the actors that's what a lot of making but again our highest budget item right i've learned to cook along the way and at one point i actually uh before we were on the road i had a job doing catering um killed the artist thomas dolby with  i mean remember thomas from the 80s yeah but i i i she blinded me with science do you remember that song anyway that was one of her catering jobs yeah in a recording i made vegetarian chili and i put too many red hot peppers in it you learn by doing but um so on our film sets you know food is really the most important thing to motivate people and show that you appreciate them so it's always fresh food i bake a lot of banana bread you know a lot of and it's usually we're vegetarian so vegetarian catering some people are trying it for the first time they find that they really like it um high vibe food also the people that we pick you know we pick people that are that are nice people you know i mean we you know there there's and we know a lot of actors a lot of talented people and we we avoid the ones that are trouble wherever possible uh you know occasionally we we will cast someone an actor who's a little bit trouble personality wise because they're so good but it's a rare thing because we you know the vibe the vibe on set and the way that people interact is so important when you're doing a sort of a community based filming like we do now we have big crowds we have i mean big group of people we had 300 people taking part in 36 husbands wow itunes amazon and google play right 300 people it's a lot you know so keep together a team of 300 for for a couple of months is not an easy thing yeah so basically it's kind of like a um we've done some crowd funding with our last two films where you know you ask for donations online and you have certain perks so we've been able to raise a little bit money that way but not it's never quite enough that's that's that's the trick kind of got into debt a little bit yeah we got into nothing too bad yeah it adds up you know but so but mainly i'd say we we we've met so many talented people all around the world with our travels every couple years you know we'll say hey we're going to make a movie do you want to be involved do you want to act in it do you want to help on set i need help with catering i need help finding locations it's basically like a world community coming together treat something bigger than ourselves and they believe in the project yeah and the neat thing is they're not there for the paycheck you know maybe down the line if if the movies make profit we'll all share in it we haven't quite gotten there yet it's the artist's collective part we do form a collective yeah i'm an artist collectively people are there for the experience um they're there because they want to be so it creates a certain vibe on set and very very inspiring vibe and everybody learns a lot we challenge people like you know on our on 36 husbands we said we're gonna pick um four main actors that will also be our crew when they're not acting they're going to help on lights they're going to help with catering they're going to help on sound they're going to help build props so we picked really special people to go around the world with us to make 36 000. we knew that we knew we were yeah and so that was really a neat way to do it and i was going to say that movie is around the world there was paris in there australia outback like uh a lot of places that was part of the idea and we thought and we so we ended up on that this movie we spent mo most of the budget on you know i was probably 50 50 on food and travel you know because we did go to australia we went to to we were went to berlin to frankfort we flew them over to l.a we stayed in l.a so that was that was a little bit still you know it's not that much because if you look at plane ticket prices at least as they were two years ago they it wasn't that much so mainly the the main thing is that you just have to get people that that have some time and that want to do it and if they're motivated to do it then it can be a beautiful experience the thing that we have the the good thing that we have that a lot of filmmakers don't is we are a touring band we're a touring act so we we tour all the time so now we tour in cinemas and we take our and when we're in a music club we make sure they have a projector so we can show the film so we do a little set of music we say hi and we say hey we're going to do the new film now oh smart q a after that's how we usually that's how we slowly you know make enough money for the next picture is by touring yeah we say how much money do we have to work with let's figure it out do we need to raise some more and um i want to tell sherry the uh experience about shooting in australia but just a little bit more on the touring aspect one thing we also did one of the greatest investments we ever made was to buy a really high-end projector 600 projector that fits in the backpack so not only do we tour cinemas and music clubs and maybe a festival where we can go but we go to people's living rooms or backyards and we make a cinema cinema so we have the projector we have speakers we travel with that's been great we play a set of music unplugged we tell the people borrow a screen or rent a screen or we'll use your wall or put a sheet up one time mark remember that farmhouse big farmhouse these guys put a sheet up we we got there in the afternoon unfortunately we was before the show and they put the sheet up but they forgot to iron it so it was the most wrinkled screen i'd ever seen in my life i said do you have an iron anywhere like this on the screen with iron and then we smoothed it out see it's it's improv but then it's so special these pop-up cinemas because they invite all their friends and family over everybody gives a donation to the artist sometimes we do a potluck dinner or you know or there's just dessert and drinks and it's really cozy and intimate and we get to sit there with the audience you know one of the ways we've learned so much as filmmakers is to watch our movie hundreds of times with different audiences around the world okay we don't just leave a lot a lot of filmmakers will just leave and come back in for the q and a but i want to see what there's we learn we see what jokes are working what are they laughing at what's not working uh you know it's such a great way to learn and a lot of filmmakers especially independent filmmakers they only get to see it with an audience at a film festival once in a while right you know but we take it on the road ourselves so again we learn by doing and every movie has gotten better and better because you learn from your mistakes right but it's been a great uh great process and it's and even though i've seen like the movies hundreds of times it's really fresh with a new audience it's it's it's almost new and i find myself laughing when i hear them laughing even though i know the jokes you know it's it's it's been really special that is a very unique approach i love it if you guys are ever up in canada i want to do that i think that sounds such a lot we got a gig in canada let's hope covid gets uh to the wayside pretty fast because i think everyone is sick of it yeah yeah it's it's gonna it's i read the headlines today worldwide is going down finally so that's good and all the you know india's had a pretty pretty good time with it lately they've said that they're really surprised that it's really gone down exactly i read that so good i hope so let's let's you know we've talked to a lot of people that seem to know about how things work and they they're saying it's never going to get really totally back to the normal the way it was you know because things for example how many companies are going to keep bringing you into an expensive office business why would they they realize you know what we don't have to do that we only need 20 of the people to be in the office which maybe is good so people can spend more time with their husband or wife or their family and you know drive for three hours a day to get to less pollution yeah i mean there's a lot of good things so we'll see it'll change things but we'll all find out what that is yeah i mean and it's moved everybody farther along into the technology you know yeah you go to the doctor online now you do do you can do almost anything you know bingo people having a social hour it's just amazing how people have embraced technology yeah absolutely sherry that gets me thinking of how we shot in australia because it really has to do with technology what you're saying so you know we're so crazy we said well we're going to tour australia we've never been and we're also going to shoot a movie there we're going to shoot a movie we don't know anybody there it's a country we've never been to but after our you know two-month tour in australia we'll bring the actors over from europe and shoot a movie why not we're gonna be there somehow we're gonna figure it out so i was booking the tour and a lot of the gigs i found was i was on facebook i was on a house concerts australia group all on my computer meeting people and so i met an american woman renee de robertas who lives in australia i met her i think it was on facebook or facebook yeah and i said hey we're looking to do a house concert pop-up screening and she said oh my husband and i we have a vineyard we have a big property and yeah why don't you you know come do a show with us and then i also told her well i'm looking for locations to shoot our movie in australia do you think you can help me find some locations so she's like you know what why don't you and your actors come stay at our vineyard for a couple weeks we've got a beautiful spot you can shoot a lot of scenes here and in fact we'll get the whole town involved you know i know a theater local theater group i know a director they had know a bunch of actors so i'd never met this woman and she just invited us in and that was one of the main locations in australia and not only you know um was it just a great place to stay they were so warm she was a great cook she was a gourmet cook um they also had a bunch of stuff lying around their property that we built props with them you know wood and metal we have a secret passage in our movie and so i needed a big figure i seen that yes remember that so we we built that but then but then um you know it's having faith and trust and having a vision and and not being afraid to ask for help you know you just you create the channel channels for the miracles to come you plant the seeds and they come and it's not always like you expect but you do the best with what you have right now that's kind of how we live our lives how we make our movies so the neat thing about michael being the writer if let's say we can't find the location that he had in his mind well he can rewrite the scene yes we're changing the nuclear submarine scene to a donut shop there you go but what was what also was amazing was so michael wrote a sheep station you know which you saw in the movie india the 36 husband script so in every show when we were doing our concert pop-up screening tour at the end of every show i'd say does anybody know somebody that has a sheep station because we're going to shoot in a movie in a couple months and so we ended up staying with this couple in in uh western australia in um esperance oh where they have those white sand beaches and the kangaroos on the beaches and he the guy said oh a friend of mine works in the sheep station i'll hook you up he's a shearer he's a sheerer so he called and it was really interesting because it was a whole different culture you know and when we called the the guys like hi yeah we're robin michael bradley that is a yeah oh yeah you know we we understand your sheepshear yep well you know your friend told us that could we come as a when okay so good okay on the shoot yep okay great and then you know and then like and then we went and met you know and then we went over to the sheep to the guy that owned the place he was just a shearer right he worked for the guy so we went to see the guy's big farm family farm 150 years old they've been in business and or sheep rancher whatever you call them grazer and we met the same thing it was like they were they were all shearing you know they were busy shearing and then they would talk to us during the break so they all stopped and they're all having a cup of tea and the same kind of thing they like it was like five words you know said the whole time they're sipping their tea and listening in the yeah you know you know whatever and it was like okay thanks like yeah and as long as we could we can keep working while you're filming yeah okay so we integrated that as you saw it was great and then yeah and then everything was worked out it was like that they're they're they were they said yes when they mean yes they say no and then we know and we found everything we wanted i mean it was it was quite a miracle and you know michael wrote a snake into the movie i'm like how am i gonna find a snake you know and and uh a husband and wife team that are snake wrestling they actually rescue snakes from people's homes and so they have about 60 reptile pets at home they brought a bunch of different ones and they were like well matilda has a kind of better personality but she's a little aggressive and sam we think sam might be the most photogenic because i and i said which one will go the way that i want him to go and he's like none of them you know you just have to see what they do what you get with the snakes but we got it we were very fortunate you know what i'm talking about the snake scene and so they they went exactly where it was supposed to go and didn't bite anybody like a good snake right but go ahead jerry i just can't believe it i i i listen to you guys and i think i cannot believe it there's some divine intervention happening here all the time that's true you know like you're you're not just manifesting but but it's even more than that yeah we're really we're really blessed and it's it's nice to share the story with you because it reminds me like how did we do that how did that happen whenever we look backwards at like how do we do that when i look at this one of the scenes we shot from years ago that i like oh yeah i remember that god how do we even we're so fortunate you know yeah locations are really important especially in independent films a lot of people just shoot in one apartment you know um but it's what's what's amazing too is that um you can edit a movie on a laptop right so michael does it all on the laptop as we travel or as we're in one place and uh you know again we can accomplish it because we we wear a lot of the hats you know you have to work hard you have to be willing to learn how to cater and produce and location scout and you know cast your actors and you know clean the floor and decorate the set but that's what makes it fun that you um challenge yourself and you learn new skills and that's that's been one of the neat things about the lifestyle i think is you know what do you what do you have to show for it well it's not like we have all these um material possessions or we have this and this and this but we have things we can take with us we've learned skills we've learned lessons and that's what it's all about i think are you enjoying your journey that that makes a successful life that makes me feel rich do you love the journey so that's uh it's been interesting well i'm i'm so impressed so i just want to ask one last question what is one piece of learning that stood the test of time for both of you that that sort of provides the support for you to live this lifestyle and accomplish what you do it's just amazing never sell your stuff and go on tour for 30 years no no i'm kidding comedy gets you through it yeah i i just you know figure out what you really want to do you know try to be honest with yourself and figure out what you're what what do you what what would you really like to do not like can you do what is possible for you to do but it's like if you could just push a magic button and your life would be a certain way what is that first try to ask that question to yourself and figure out what that is and then analyze it because it may be a symbolism it may be symbolic of something you know it's not for example if you say well i want to be a billionaire living on you know living on the amalfi coast in a giant 10 billion mansion with everybody loving me it's like okay that's a little hard to do if you're like if you wash cars for a living but what does it represent will it represent independence it represents freedom it represents maybe being warmer you know i don't know ask yourself what is the what is the inner you know that you're going to get the initial vision of it but what is what does that mean what is inside of that vision what is the essence of it and that's you can you can certainly manifest something like that and you'll see as you take little steps toward it oh that feels pretty good that feels right oh i see that's what i would say that's the hardest thing in life is figuring out what why what is my what am i doing now in this life what is the point here yeah people get too busy too fast they sign up they the parents sign them up and the society signs them up for this whole list of things house a car job car house spouse kids you know all that right and that can be the best thing in the world i'm not saying that's bad but that's kind of the routine thing that one size fits all boom and then a lot of times people could make themselves do it and there's some joys there but then they get to be mid-life and they go well well well what is going on how did i get i know exactly what you mean and how are you robin yeah in our society it's like well when you retire you can do what you really want it's like whose life is it anyway what what you know i don't like the one-size-fits-all thing because it's just not true but i i think for me i mean there's so many things but if i had to really boil it down live your life with faith and trust you know develop a relationship with the divine friend that animates us all and then you can actually have a beautiful journey and ask for help don't be afraid to ask for help i think you know without the help of so many loving people around the world we couldn't have had this incredible journey this beautiful adventure and most people are afraid to ask for help or they don't think they're worthy of it or i don't know it's it's like i've got to do it myself i'm just amazed at how many people that i still come across that oh they're an acquaintance or i don't really know them or i couldn't ask them for that it's like people can say no yeah as long as you're not too pushy depends on what you're asking don't ask ever ask anything that's harmful yeah harmful sure you got to have good ideas can you give me a ride to the airport that's not going to kill anybody but that's that's unless the person can't drive right yeah i mean it's like we we all love to help people it makes us feel good so you're you're actually giving somebody a gift too sometimes you know it's it's really a mutual beautiful thing so i think just being helpful and supportive to each other and nurturing yourself and again just having that faith and trust to keep going don't give up and even if you feel the fear okay don't let it stop you so everything's possible if you dream it i'm not making this one up it's it's a cliche you've heard it but if you dream that you can do it that's what i feel or some version of it i thought i made that up so tell me and tell the listeners

duck into the start theater remember that was not actually this is where I was heading when those crazed fans suddenly showed up thanks you my father won't find out wait you weren't allowed to go to the movies I am with my bodyguard her Natalie of course but I'm not sure my father would have allowed me to see this particular movie oh no sometimes a horror movie no no don't worry it's a very rare

that during the day we were still having slots available where I could be serving and more patients and I was very unsure of anything to do with online marketing in the past I had tried Facebook ads and Google AdWords however they didn't really work for me they didn't provide much return for the costs that was put up front for that and Shawn was already a patient of mine and he got in contact with me and had a meeting with me and from from there really we started to work together on putting together a campaign to fill up the empty spaces I was having with new patients because that's really what we wanted we wanted more traffic coming to the clinic in the form of new patients I really did not know much about online marketing on how to target people by this medium and Shawn was a great help because he was able to come and visit and talk me through step by step the whole way the campaign was going to work out and what I would have needed to learn what he needed for me to do to get the ball rolling with that he provided excellent support and the whole time the campaign was going up any questions I had I just emailed him that he got back to me straightaway okay and very easy to deal with and as a result of the campaign we were able to book in a lot more new patients and see a lot more people and close a lot more of the patients as well and the campaign turned out to be really successful I was very happy with us and I would definitely recommend Sean", "86Lb-RbOqwM": "oh and mine was playing a mini guitar a couple people asked it's not a ukulele not anymore it's one

Paris we'll try to get in touch with you thanks for signing up and anytime if you have a question about anything just raise your hand huh yeah if you want to know something but you can see with you know in with indie filmmaking independent filmmaking it really takes a lot of people to put it together as you saw our credits are very long and it's pretty neat because everybody is there because they love to be there they just want to create art together with this kind of collective work at the artists collective and we literally walked around Berlin and in Italy to find the locations and you know I always tell Michael write the script how you want to write it don't worry about the budget we don't really have much to work with but we'll figure out a way to make the movie somehow and so you know I read the script and I said what it opens that a villa in Italy how are we gonna find a villa I think budget opening so we actually had our art costume design it was Italian and she knew quite a lot of people there so we were just looking at friends villas and we looked at five different villas there's some beautiful ones in Tuscany but they all didn't look right on camera so I kept saying no tell these beautiful things you're saying no the sixth one was this giant one then that was what we were looking for a guitar player friend of ours had placed there he's played there for 25 years doing little shows and he's friends with the owner and the woman that owns that just loved our spirit and that we were really just trying to make art and trying to do just do stuff for just because we can private garden that was her garden and she invited us back to shoot more in fact we just showed the movie there a couple months ago at her Villa and she invited us back to shoot the next picture and it's a huge villa that we all you only see about 1/10 of it in the film so we're actually going to shoot some of the spine movie there so so we'll be back for that and a one funny thing you know the the killers the two killers that are following him around that there's a massage scene where they get the couples massage you know at the end well the bald haired guy Tony he's very harry's a very hairy guy and when he read this the screenplay and showed that he was going to be on a massage table he apparently has a very hairy back so he went to a waxing place where they where they rip your hair off and he spent fifty bucks to get his back waxed well he didn't tell me about it and when he got to set he lays on his face I said no no no lay on your back so I want to see your face so the poor guy he went through fifty dollars in terrible pain for nothing he told us that at one of the shows that's a commitment our actors are committed he's going to be in the next picture as well of the two killers are both going to be in the next picture I was just thinking about the scene in Berlin you know where it's raining during the suicide scene and you know most Hollywood movies they close off the streets right they pay to close off the streets and they get rain machines well for us we wanted him to try to kill himself and there's a particular part of the city that looked really good on camera and it also happens to be one of the most touristic spots it's let's always jam packed with tourists day and night so I thought well Sunday night three o'clock in the morning we'll go there there'll be nobody so we go there Sunday night three o'clock in the morning it was packed tourists everywhere Americans drinking beer ten feet away from where he's supposed to jump off the bridge so I've been so we thought what are we gonna do all of a sudden a rain storm hit one of those weird Berlin storms it just comes in it gets really cold the wind blows and it just comes down like a so everyone ran to the bars to go get you know to stay out of the rain and so I grabbed the camera crew said this is this so we ran into the rain and we shot that scene in about as quickly as possible in about an hour before everybody went back to their drinking positions and it's freezing look at the ever see the film again II mean look at that shot for like a kilometer there's no one in the shot which would have cost us you know like Steven Spielberg money again Berlin blocked up so uh anybody have any questions before we close out because I know you have trains to get you have a question it's definitely an artist collective and what we do is just percentage models everyone works on percentage including us and we make all our money go to the picture you know to the screen we feed everyone really well and we we spend what we have to like to get rent equipment or something but normal but everything else is just pure speculative so we all take a chance together and I basically said all my friends they were propeller professionals what are you doing this summer you're busy then go do your job but if you're not come with us let's make a picture that's basically what we do because we'd rather do something that's sit around wishing we were doing something and in fact like five or six of the people that we work with have received you know major agents design they've been a lot of them are doing television now and you know it's really helped quite a lot of people you know by just having a calling card that they could be on the screen so that's what we're trying to do and it's just been pretty like we were saying cuz we've been you know traveling for 27 years everywhere we go we meet really interesting artists all over the world and then every couple of years we just kind of come together and say let's make a new movie and also people that have the interesting places or professions like a friend of ours has a a warehouse where they make steel machinery they make steel fences and it's a beautiful giant where we shot a film there a couple films ago because it just looks so weird and fantastic I said can I shoot here and he made arrangements with his father to let us come in on the weekend and shoot so we got this fantastic looking picture you know looking image from our friends we fight you know people around the world want to support the arts and it's such a beautiful thing when you find people that want to come together in this way we have a lot of fun it's very inspiring does anybody have any kind of close down I think one thing I love these I want to say is so independent filmmaking the way to get the film to live it we really need your help if you guys could go to iTunes whatever country you're from because we just got released in iTunes in 86 countries we're very excited about this release it's up now in France and oh mister Rodolfo in France they took the Jubilee out it's not new it's just awful so you can find it on iTunes but if you'll go to iTunes and please rate it and write a little couple of sentences about it you know if you enjoy the picture please take the trouble if you didn't like the movie please forget all about this experience life is hard enough without getting care so yeah please especially if you can be really really enough you want to recommend it they can rent it for just a couple euro on iTunes it really helps us it helps the movie to live and it helps the you know helps everyone to start talking about the film or TV that's what's there so that's about it if you there's still the list if you want to sign up for you can be a star contest there's still tomorrow yes and and I want to tell you guys to our last movie go explore flow we have with us tonight but it's also on iTunes so you can you can check that out and if anybody wants see these are anything we also I forgot to mention we can also do digital so I think we're closing out next we all got to catch train again not only thanks to all of you for coming oh there's a question but I want to say thanks to under the Milky Way who you know really made this possible our distributor and co-producer and Valentine for helping put this together [Applause] it's beautiful the question was basically how do I get the inspiration for the film the way that I write films is basically over a course of several months I will come up with with little pieces of an idea and there's a certain moment where I have a lot of little pieces I carry around a moleskin notebook with me all the time and I'm always making notes if I get an idea that's business story all I have a little word or stuff code word for that particular story I'll write it down like 36 husbands the new one is 36 so i right 36 you know this thing about a spy does this if I see somebody do something funny somewhere I like oh that's funny if I changed a little it could be so after a few months of that when I feel like oh now I've got the story I've got the hook and it was the same with Rodolfo I thought well I wanted to pressed Italian fashion design I knew that that was the first I thought okay cause he kills tries to kill himself but it doesn't work that's the second thing I thought oh and then somebody wants to have him killed at the same time that he's gonna kill him so then I started when I get enough little twists and turns then I realized okay now I got a story that's basically how I put this together and then for me the screenwriting is fairly fast because I've been working on the story for several months if not a year so the screenwriting is usually two to three weeks I'm finished with the screenplay because it's already all worked out in my head so that's just a certain peculiar we are you one but that's how I do it thank you for the question said thanks everybody I think you gotta close out so thank you so much [Applause]", "UQ0vwiMdFcA": "I'm so proud of myself up here and it's like I oh by the way you guys love to any fight right didn't

just record albums and touring around the world and we stopped we thought that since we started making films we would do the same thing with the films so instead of making a record album and touring and playing on radio we make movies and we come to cinemas play a few songs and show so that's how we tour now that's our life you eat for a long time once these seven years later together for 27 years so I think that deserves a little respect Oh does anyone need translation raise your hand don't be don't be shy why we met in Los Angeles has anyone been to Los Angeles LA okay a couple people Michael and I way back in 1989 we were both playing at a music club on the Sunset Strip right on Sunset and Laurel Canyon some of you know that famous place right so we were both playing in a music club we didn't know each other and we ended up getting together and writing a song a love song I love so now what happens when you write a love right you go on to her for 27 years but actually a year after we met we decided to quit our jobs in Los Angeles and sell everything we had and we bought two one-way tickets to Amsterdam we knew one guy living there and our dream was to travel and play music just to see what would happen yeah 27 years later we're still just seeing what's gonna happen I really don't know from week to week what's happening really now it's a little more organized that's a few weeks ahead or months to pass but it's very it's Jerry nomadic and it's very like sort of gypsy lifestyle we just keep going though so we're gonna just play a few songs for you before we show the film and this is one of our older songs unfortunately it never goes out of style it's called the world is mad or the monkey song one morning at the dawn of man a bunch of monkeys sat around in the sand it was heaven grooming picking fleas they were happy they were simple they were monkey one of the ape men picked up a rock he nodded his head as he got his first thought he measured the weight he felt it was sharp time for Eden and and mankind to start [Music] don't be late to the pumpkin you know those little red ace that we can't stand [Music] I got a jagged rock and a beauty of a plan time marches on as it often does we see a bunch of naked apes with gas masks and guns in the bloody bloody trench with barbed wire around when it's over no one knows what it was all about move along to a similar time of week resolve and the Maginot Line when a damn good performer reaches millions of years and tells them exactly what they wanna hear wedeck makes perfect sense what the Chancellor says well as method to tough [Music] you've got nothing to hear you're a decent man [Music] [Music] [Applause] a Korean and Indian and African who are afraid of each other and afraid of us to to pick up the phone to call toll-free - the Pentagon said pretty please I'll take a hundred and ones and some ten six teams and as many rocket launchers and across the water in a Chinese junk Satta Taiwan general who was there's a punk thus we armed all his neighbors but forgot about him so we offered the same buddy sandy forget a chance and we called up the friend Shetty said I'll take a hundred jet fighters and so happy oh and a dry red [Music] [Applause] [Applause] bloodstained I said stop to cash Willis don't great brain-dead the [Music] [Applause] well it's really exciting for us to be in Paris this is the very first time we've ever been in a cinema in Paris and in France we've actually never showed a movie in a cinema in France before so thank you for coming it took us 27 years to get here but you know it's funny I needed a chair our backstage and they have this thing it says Groucho you know Groucho Marx but do you guys know how he got his name a lot of people don't know Groucho there's a thing that performers carry when they're touring it's called a grouch bag you know when you're a grouch it means you don't trust anybody and a grouch bag has got all your money in it from the show and he would never take it off because you know they were they were working night after night and some very funky towns back in those days so he had his money bag with him the whole time because he didn't want it you know sometimes they had to leave in the middle of the night or something quickly and that's how he got his name Groucho because he always had that Grouch bag I don't know if you knew that but I just read it I just read a book right before the tour about those guys and fantastic people because the movie you're about to see was co-produced and distributed by a very special company that has an office here in Paris they're called under the Milky Way there they're French they're French and so we're really grateful to them for putting this together for us and they had really good launches that they're at they're all yeah we're real excited about that's why we like them so as you know Michael and I love to travel you know even after 27 years it's still very romantic and exciting to get on a train and go somewhere because in LA were always in our car right so we love travelling by train and by boat and you know by plane when we have to I love to fly but I think I think Raina's when were interesting for me since I didn't grow up with it this is a just a boat song and so we have been lucky enough to go to India six times who's been to India anyone yes it's funny when everywhere in Germany and we asked who's been to India like half the room will raise their hands well we noticed there's always Australians and Germans no matter where you go travelling for some reason they just maybe they I know they like they where they live but they like to travel right we see them everywhere what we do see French but not as much as youth not as much but anyways we love spending time in India and a lot of times in between the tours will go for six months at a time and we really go to take a break to work on new movie ideas new song ideas so we were staying in Kashmir on a really big houseboat and we we took a little rowboat on a lake called Dal Lake and all the lotus flowers were in bloom it was so beautiful and so that inspired us next on picked up the table in the India [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] before [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay we're gonna sit in the front row you're wanted by the police just go like that or something all right so let's see so yeah we'll sit right over here what what we're also gonna do Michael I'll do a video Valentine can do the video right what do you think well I usually direct but maybe I will let you do it yeah so just just sweep you know like when we do the the Paris thing just sweep make sure we get everybody on that with you too if you have to do two photos for the for the picture I'll just stick them together he's a director right I know Michael um I think before the photo you should tell everybody about the video what we're gonna do okay maybe you go backstage no escape so right basically what we're doing at every town is we're having the audience say the name of the town we have like Los Angeles Hollywood San Diego London Paris we have about 50 or 60 of these already and this is the first Paris one so this is good and you guys will definitely make the cut and what I'm gonna do is roll I'm gonna cut them all together one after the other in the video so if you guys are enthusiastic and you're not to like like that what you want we want the happy French not the depressed so that way so if you're that way then we'll definitely make great so when Michael yells action we go to Paris like that okay papi you say it in your own way however you want a French way right you should hold the happy face yeah you're learning good okay all right everybody ready first we'll do a photo okay okay look at the nice man with the kid well that's just a photo that's a photo yeah and now the video or do you do another photo week video ok now the video so tell us when you're rolling yeah turn the camera tell me when you're rolling you rolling cuz I'll edit it don't worry that's ok you rollin for sure how many times do you apply for an American taking a photograph let me just see I want to make sure like I said I usually see he's got to do this on set right make sure you have it before you say we're moving on we thought checking the game no you cut off the beginning so you let it roll now it's rolling so just leave it rolling people like you guys didn't ever what it's like on a movie set because you do things about 25 times you're over it over and over right in film boxes tonight this is the first time we're actually putting our instruments on top of film boxes which is kind of fun cuz they weigh a ton they're hit alright but 35 millimeter film is so heavy and beautiful but it's right it's really nice that we don't have to carry around you know since we travel by train we can't carry tables around with us right we have our instruments so it's kind of fun because when we to our cinemas you never know what they're gonna have sometimes we sit on top of a table you never know but I like these so now where do you do a sing-along you guys are all warmed up yes you're all ready to go there are three little words to this song very simple and they are the words our brand new me can you guys say that brand new me nice I see a brand new me I see a brand new me very simple you've got it a positive psychological message yes [Music] the I'm gonna change like Superman step in the booth and make reply Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] where do I feel [Music] [Music] [Music] I see [Music] now [Music] I'm gonna change [Music] [Applause] so we're gonna do one more sing-along because now you're now do you remember those little pieces of paper we they gave you when you came in he fished those out yes cuz that's got the lyrics on it there's a little more words it's a little complicated right even before that we want to tell them about a contest for having race give those things ready and then we'll get ready for the last song it's the last song but we wanted to tell you guys about the contest that we have a contest so we decided since we're making these films this is our sixth feature film that we've made our sixth feature and we are going about to make our seventh feature film very soon and also we're very happy that we're gonna continue on with under the Milky Way our fantastic French co-producer distributor they're fantastic people and so we are going to do the next movie with them now the reason I'm telling you about the movie is because we decided to involve more people in the process here's how it works we have a contest well the name of the contest says it all the name of the contest is the you can hear star contest you can be a star contest basically all you have to do to get in the contest is sign our email list so that we can tell you when the new movies come out what we're ready to go if you sign the email list in a way that we can read that's the difficult part a lot of times people scratch it so fast I cannot understand if you sign up carefully and I can read it then we will put you in a big hat we put your names and a half and before then every movie we pull four names out of the Hat and I put those people somewhere in the movie now I also write the movies and so I can usually write apart for you even if you're if you think you're not talented I can usually figure out a way to make you seem like you're talented for a few seconds movie magic movie magic so so it's a lot of fun actually for us to figure out what to do with the people and anyway the new movie is coming out you know probably about two years from now actually would be ready or a year and a half we're gonna film it next summer we're filming it next summer and we'll be very close to here we may even film in Paris so it'll be easy to put you guys in it the name of the new movie is called new film it's called 36 husbands and it's about three girls who are spies basically it's a comedy a romance comedy and these three spy girls who are very good at coming booze well go around the world making trouble for 36 husbands that's basically how it works out so just so you know you you're the first artist to ever hear that title because we just nailed it you can remember that for nine for a year and a half so please sign up on the break after we're did this our last song so after this song we're gonna take a little break so you can sign that you could be a star contest very important then we're gonna just take five minutes so you can get a Coke or whatever a drink whatever and then we're gonna watch the film right so there are we sing this last song the black cat song I'm gonna teach it to you we're gonna teach you the chorus and this song that we're gonna sing did you tell them it's in the movie is in the movie you're about to watch now there somebody else sings it not us in the film but we basically wrote it like all the songs and it is there's one thing in the lyrics the Khedive a we talked about a thing called the cod a bay that's the department store that's a store very for very rich people to go and spend all their money in Berlin cod a they so you'll see that in the lyrics and you all know what a mink coat is right mink is the fur coat right okay so that's the two things sometimes trip people up sing after me it goes like this lead a black cat to the water and take himself a drink lead a black cat to the water and take himself a dream lead a fat cat to the caught a bay and themself a lead a black cat to the water and one you will get

here and that's that's something that I don't take for granted that's something that I value tremendously and I think about it every day but part of the reason that I have it is because I've always appreciated beauty I've always set the bar for myself that wherever I was going to live it was going to be in a beautiful place and that that has to go that that's something that that's involved with with the idea the concept of intention you have to intend to succeed you have to intend to make your life better you can't sit on the sidelines and wait for things to happen you gotta set a goal and

so once we get there we're automatically gonna win the game because of reasons everyone who gets the middle first automatically wins the game it's literally science I've done it I've seen this has happened before well let this man do his thing and then we're going to loot every single chest and obviously the middle ones are the better ones and that right see when they kill me I have a secret lucid plan and I'm going to kill this I was looting chest excuse me you just kill me while I'm looting chest what kind of person are you you're not even a person up whatever this will go back so

what's going on in this town so this is to do all the skittles the one we been following for a little while here what's interesting about this plant is really how senescence setting if you compare it to a lot of other plants comparing to the blueberries a lot of 41 over here so when we're talking about senescence we're talking about metabolic function in the plant at a cellular level just starting to slow down until the client eventually dies so it's gonna consume what's left really in the in the top trees and the plants and the leaves are gonna see things all that all the sugars are going to be here at the last part of the plant and the plants going to be taking all those sugars and of course we're going to see different colors coming up the leaves having a look at the blueberry gelato 41 this is the first time that I've tried this strain the frost is really amazing on the strength when the trimming is done in this plant definitely there will be some saving done to just some of the Fox tailing or rather some beliefs these me to the Fox daily I was talking about this is the first time that I've tried the light in the tent with this intensity what I'm using is equivalent to an HL g550

suggestion on how to solve her hair dilemma involved rubbing alcohol which then landed the 40 year old in the er fox 46 chief legal correspondent sema eyer is here to tell us about this lawsuit how it came to be where we think well i shouldn't even say lawsuit yet right that is correct paige all we know is that she has hired a lawyer but it's really important that we look at the timeline to determine if that lawsuit will in fact stick now this uh 40 year old woman she sprayed the gorilla glue into her hair replacing her normal hairspray over a month ago then last thursday she did a tick-tock video and she says that she used gorilla glue so that's an admission it's really important that we know that she admits to using gorilla glue she says she washed her hair 15 times approximately in the month after that she did this incident occurred and then after this tick tock video which was seen by over 18 million people at that point a gorilla glue twitter account it's not a verified twitter account but it says gorilla glue they recommended that she use rubbing alcohol saturate her head with rubbing alcohol she went to the er after that so it's been a month since this actually happened over a month yeah does that factor in here at all in terms of how much time passed from when this occurred and when she's when she put it on social media paige you ask the best legal questions okay yes it does yes it does because because it's very important paige that number one if you are injured you warn the other party she never worn gorilla glue in a timely fashion then we have to look at that month were there any intervening circumstances she washed it what did she wash it with what was she exposed to all of this needs to be looked at by a court of law and then finally notice she never gave them notice to rectify the problem paige and i do want to point out too before you go too because i know that you don't think that there's much merit to this case so then my question to you was then why does a lawyer take it and people are speculating a lawyer might take it for the same reason we think she might have done this or some people think she might have done this

out that back a little bit ago okay is there a gun and I was hoping that was a gun sitting in the back all right so uh yeah what what do we want to do upgrade um the image reload hmm the upgrade capacity reload or damage I'm thinking well all of them are good because capacity I don't have to reload as often I could reload faster or I don't need a rillo as often because I kill him quicker let's go with damage just cuz that seems like it would be the better of the options anyway oh I see him uh one moment I need to change one of the buttons on my mouse all right I had to switch my my

his ankle um of course another senchan sniper ammo for a rifle I don't have damn it okay that's not impossible to deal with as long as they don't get behind me and at least they're loud when they teleport if they weren't that would be a lot harder okay I hear you you're around somewhere unless I just have to constantly look at my back I keep my back to a wall it would be best oh well that's the duty twisters are shotgun ok now I'm ok I'm 100-percent ok while all this well that's yep what I'm gonna have to deal with now yeah well get back yeah get back please please get back oh my god

stuff his main rival is another black back fourteen-year-old beezer who although smaller has got bags of attitude there's definite tension between these two looks like marembo is itching for a fight and charges towards beater visas having none of it and sees him off these young males are pretenders to racino's throne and pumping with testosterone piezo's especially hot blooded and martha doesn't want to encourage contact with us this is a troublemaker [Music] um move back he's escorting tinder a pregnant female and martha gives gorilla grunts to calm him as he passes meanwhile the kids play on completely carefree they know their daddy is close by the silverback is the ultimate protector of the group and everything about rouchina's powerful presence underlines that fact wow that was him telling us with the way now clear little chooch jumps onto his mom's back and they follow regina back into the forest but no one has carried out this experiment with growers guerrillas in the wild will they see this and run a mile will they see this and want to investigate it what will they make of it that's what i want to find out i've disinfected everything to ensure there's no health risk to the gorillas and the mirror is perspex so it can't shatter if handled okay there's a cluster of gorillas down there and it may well be that might come up this slope so i'm just gonna see if i can install the tank there the mirror quickly attract the attention of two young gorillas oh gosh straight away one of the juveniles has come straight up to not a worry in the world [Music] some animals are surprised when they see their own reflection and react aggressively so it's interesting to see that these gorillas are so calm and inquisitive there's absolutely no fear and this will be the very very first time that any of these girls have actually looked into a mirror seen a proper reflection of themselves [Music] all right he's homeless herself there they're more interested in how it feels rather than how it looks it really shows how gentle they are it's not like they've seen this thing and they want to rip it apart and break it just exploring really delicately smelling it touching it looking into it there's no indication that these juveniles are making the connection between themselves and the image in the mirror even human children take a while to recognize their own reflection so maybe it's just a matter of time baby muhira is intrigued [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay it looks like moira was interested but munger wasn't letting him play with a new thing in the forest play time's over it's been fascinating but i suspect it would take a lot more exposure to the mirror before the gorillas show signs of self-recognition you've got parked vehicles coming through you've got trucks loaded up with charcoal and that's why chimanuka is just so tense about crossing the road if it was just him he could find him so he's just waiting nervously for a quiet time to cross with his whole family i feel for him after 20 minutes we take matters into our own hands and lambert stops the traffic look at this oh my gosh now there you go that's confidence for you with chimanuka in charge the orphan morale is confident enough to venture out oh fantastic oh my gosh look at this the whole family muhira and his mother are almost the last ones to break cover and scamper over absolute confidence luke with all the youngsters across safely chimanuka can stop being the lollipop man the boss showing us that despite there's a road running through this is still his jungle i love it it's a great relief to see the whole family across the road in safety this area is more densely forested than the sections we've been in before it's criss-crossed with guerrilla trails so there are clearly other families around and muguruka's arrival just adds to the numbers here he comes oh my word right down onto the road amazing he didn't even i thought maybe stop being a bit reluctant but because he came meters from me to see him out in the open like this you see how big he is amazing there's little doubt that silverback ranu would love to claim his hard-earned right to the female in his group but at 37 years old tuck is most definitely not interested in sex nearly all females stop by their mid to late 30s unfortunately ranu doesn't know this and keeps trying to impress her with his displays of strength but all this seems to do is make tut more determined to ignore him so as ranu continues to harm tuck her sons come to her defense now the smallest guerrilla in the group decides to show the mighty silverback ranu who's in charge wow this is hardly the great leader in control pushed around by the youngest male in the group and spurned by tuck the only female things couldn't get much worse with muguruka close on his tail chamanuka keeps the family moving and it becomes more and more difficult to keep track of them i've given the rangers a camera to make sure that we don't miss anything having circled each other for some time chimanuka and mugaruka are now meters apart this is a clear threat to chimanuka and his family [Music] [Applause] ah it looks like chimanuka has seen off mugaruka but at what cost the family have scattered chimanuka has been injured and it'll be some time before the full repercussions become apparent i won't see my gorilla family for another couple of months will chimanuka be overthrown and lose everything the fate of orphan murali baby muera and the whole family hangs in the [Music] balance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you",

more scps but in gta 5 go check out my second channel link in the description below thanks for watching and check out these videos on your screen right now", "zwX0rsdlY80": "i'm not that person y'all trying to make me out to be i'm not that person i'm not this whole gorilla glue girl my name is tessica brown call me i'll talk to you i'll let you know exactly who i am jessica i mean i see it in your face right now i know you have a lot of emotions going on how are you first and foremost how are you feeling um i'm almost i'm over it i'm over it yeah so we see your the current status of your hair right now you went to the emergency room what exactly did they give you and is it helping at all well when i went there they took me straight to the back for one she started using a little um acetone effects yeah and she started getting it from the back but as she's getting it it's burning so they have the sailing water trying to cool it as she was going but it was burning to the point where my heart was beating to the face so we would stop she would go again we would stop and she's telling me tesla if we get this out of here we gonna be here for at least 20 hours so i asked her what could is it possible that i can go home and let my mom and my sisters do it at least you know i can be home because i do have three children that have to come three little girls that i have to come home to so i mean and now people are saying oh she should have stood in the hospital for those 20 hours yeah yeah and i want to talk to you about that about the opinions and how you're dealing with that because i know it's a lot on you on top of what you're already struggling with um but before we get to that can you walk us through the moment this happened a month ago when you ran out of hairspray can you walk us through that moment well i was going somewhere and my oldest son he had my car so when i went to go use my spray it didn't have anymore so i'm like you know that was the closest thing to it and soon as i get home i could wash it right out but when i got home it didn't wash out see that was my major question were you in a rush to go somewhere you know i mean i'm a woman too and i like my hair right but if i don't have a product i'll just wait but it seems as if you were in a rush have you ever used gorilla glue before yeah i used it before and it worked pretty good so you used it on your hair before no no no no no no okay like i've used it on like for christmas i've used it so at what point did you realize that it was a major problem was it when you got home and you tried to wash it out well no it was like i'm gonna say the week later and i had to call my mama like my this is not coming out this this is not coming out so we started using all kind of overuse olive oil cooking oil uh tea tree we was using pretty much any old so that's on the video it was so so shiny yeah yeah but then everybody started you know the reason i went to the internet because i never was gonna take the social media the reason i took it to social media because i i didn't know what else to do and i know somebody out there could have told me something yeah i didn't think for one second when i got up the next morning it was gonna be everywhere how are you dealing with that because of course there are opinions you have people throwing shade but you have also a lot of people showing support and love yeah so emotionally how are you dealing with all those opinions i'm usually the person that i don't care you know what people say you know i just move at my own pace you know i don't care what people say but it's just getting to the point where you know people are on tv saying stuff about me you don't even know me like if you knew me you wouldn't you would you wouldn't say have to stop you're saying if they knew me and you reached out for help it wasn't me it was for advice again it never was for this then somebody said oh well she spread it in my head um on purpose just to get to here who in their right mind would it just say oh well let me just spray this in my head and you know i'm gonna become famous overnight never listen and the inside of my head is like you know little radiance just who would want that who would want that i needed somebody to tell me how to take this home that's all it was do you regret posting it definitely wow definitely definitely i told my i told my son today i wish i could just i mean go back yeah because i'm i'm over it i'm over i'm over it is shaving your hair an option or shaving your head an option or is that well when we tried to do the razor we could like when we did the um acid it was like you could have got under here um but then we couldn't get to the other spots but last night i ended up cutting my ponytail oh i mean everybody knows the breed never was mine but my opponent itself we cut it off last night so in the middle you can still feel my hair it's just all around and then we started with the um the i forgot the name of the stuff we started with that that no um i didn't say the name because i feel like they're gonna make that a big name okay yeah so we started with that and as we're doing it in the front the baby bangs that i had yeah just started coming off like oh yeah if i mean i don't do it on here but if you i can pretty much white because i'll put some stuff on it just make it look like it's black yeah okay okay yeah wow so so your hair is falling out there yes other than the fact that you should never use gorilla glue in your hair again what is this teaching you what do you think i'm pretty much yeah just don't use it yeah don't use it yeah because i know and don't post it true true i know for me i've i had to learn a lot of hard lessons when it comes to all the extremes i would go to for beauty you know like because girl you see my edges too like i like my hair to be laid and as black women we have our tricks you know our things we do here and there um but do you think you're at a point now where you're thinking about the extreme length you went to to to get this style perfect have you thought about that like maybe reconsidering that i should have just put a hat on so is your hair is it loosening up at all or it is but it's it's like i told it's taking a minute only because the stuff that we're using it's burning yeah like it's burning are you feeling anything physically like did the doctor say that this can't hurt you anyway as far as like i get it extreme headache and he said by the time i get it all out or cut it all off i may have scalp damage and in some parts my hair might not even grow back all right well let's talk about the love that's being sent your way a lot of celebrities chance the rapper being one of them he's saying that he's glad people are supporting you has there been anyone else who reached out to you that we may know of offering any assistance and if so how are they trying to help portia mm-hmm yeah porsha wants to send me here just hilarious i mean me and i talk every day like you know like we're friends wow yeah like we're really friends who else it's it's a lot of it's a lot a lot of people i can tell you one person i saw beyonce's longtime hairstylist neil he offered you a wig and girl that's something i said look he does beyonce's hair so are you going to take him up on that offer that's a silver lining in this whole situation that's one at least listen but i'm telling you it's a lot of people that want to give me hair but the reason i wasn't accepting it because i don't want people to be like oh that's why she didn't and i totally get that in the social media world that you know we have to deal with at the same time girl you're going through some some some struggles and you have people offering assistance so if you want it i say this is just my advice don't allow that to stop you from getting your blessings because that's a blessing and there are a number of blessings coming your way um i want to talk about the gorilla glue statement that they released they said that they sympathize with what you're going through but they also made it clear that on the warning label it says not to get the glue in your skin on your skin or in your eyes or clothing what did you think of their response i made a mistake i mean i okay yeah i mean i don't know yeah so there there were some reports or according to tmz you hired attorney and are weighing your legal options against gorilla glue is that true no i i know i've never ever seen that wow yeah i mean again i don't know where all of this is coming from because at this point everybody's saying it like girl yeah my heart goes out to you right now you also launched a gofundme account a lot of people are helping um you've already raised over 12 000 for people who want to help what exactly is the money going towards well the wigs that everybody's telling me i'm need that's why i only said you know fifteen hundred dollars yeah but from us reading about everything that's pretty much probably about the goal of my head and already done start happening after the hair situation is fixed you now have people that are interested in

bit but we're gonna use this we have some on here already but i'm gonna just add a little more and we're just gonna cut this whole ponytail off and try to let it breathe a little bit but this is pretty much a close-up of the ponytail they got the ponytail holders in there so i'm gonna wind up just having to cut it off a little bit at a time to try to get in here and let it breathe a little bit so this is kind of what it looked like no no i was able to get the uh i was able to get the ponytail off but it's still not opening it up as y'all can see it's still kind of hard so it's really

the wheel but chemicals that has components to dissolve medical grade adhesive remover that we use in the operating room and the company was very generous to us i had an mgd to it okay which is uh aloe vera and olive oil mixture a little acetone unfortunately why gorilla glue doesn't have a solution to it and actually i did make a phone call to gorilla glue but she's been through a lot and i hope that you guys will learn from jessica's injuries or testiculars or deal make sure that any time that you guys grab something make sure you read it and painful i know i'm sure you were startled when it wouldn't come out yeah listen this is the reason i ended up taking it to social media the headaches got worse the tingling got worse we couldn't think of nothing else to do so i went to social media with it i'm just over the talk shows and the the hate groups i'm over all of that because y'all really like they don't know me and they have some people out there saying oh well she did this for

let you know about my kind of experiences with him and so I've always kind of struggled with the marketing side of things you know there's just so much kind of fluff out there you know everyone's offering this like you know fantastic service everyone's telling you that they're doing it right and everyone else is doing it wrong and you know it can be little bit overwhelming and even if you're kind of doing something you know you don't know if you're doing it right and you know I've talked to a lot of business owners and they all just kind of agree that like this sort of sort of mentality that that's out there and what you're being kind of pushed towards it's kind of making marketing the last thing you kind of go to so you know I did kind of decide looking all heard good things about Shawn so it'll go take Shawn on board and you know see what he can do for me and you know because of all this I was like obviously like a little bit kind of hesitant because you just get fed so much it's kind of information a daily basis and you know I was you know very present he's pleasantly surprised Shawn was like you know fantastic - worth it he made everything very clear like he lifted the veil on everything for me and you know it gave me an opportunity to kind of work on the business as opposed to kind of like you know in the business and I know that like that that side of things that Shawn takes over trying to handle out yourself those kind of SAP a lot of energy and sometimes like a lot of motivation from you so it's really just good to know that you've got like you know a perfect professional there to kind of you know help guide you through things and basically get you the kind of results that you want you know I've always tried to do up on myself and you know I kind of thought that I was able to and you know kind of show kind of show me look that there is this always like you know updating kind of methods and always new new methods kind of get more people down and you know just as a example like the last program I ran like it pretty much could rupal in terms of signups that I've kind of usually have when I thought hey that did okay you know I didn't realize the potential that I could have had so I mean like you know he by far kind of paid you know his own sort of I suppose his own price back so you know it was really tough with that you know to anyone out there who kind of does have the same sort of hesitation I would say kind of get onto them because you know I'm glad that I did and you know it's really good to know that I've got someone kind of like you know fighting in my corner on that type of thing that could just be kind of very overwhelming and you know a lot of people don't get into business to for the marketing to get into business for the passionate part of what they love them for me that's kind of fitness and creating a business and not so much you know I've never been a sales person so I've never really been good at getting the word out there and that's what kind of Shawn helped me with he helped me kind of get the word out there like to the right people and you know over the position that can help people everyone that signed up has you know be thankful that they've came on board so you know we've all got kind of Shawn to thank for that so yeah if you work on Hazard I would recommend them and it's definitely a very good decision that I made I'm very glad that I did and you know I'll continue to work with them you know long into the future", "cLBeH_DHI0M": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll put a hook

[Music] [Music]", "WAGMUaJaxYE": "i'm going to share a little bit of the experience that i've gained over the years of applying for different jobs and trying to get interviews a lot of the tips that i'm going to be sharing here are applicable for beginners as well as people who have some experience unless you're a 20-year veteran who has a resume that speaks for itself usually getting a job can be a little bit difficult so hopefully with these tips that i'm gonna provide you it can make that process a bit easier for you all right so before i get into the tips for applying and getting interviews for a developer job i wanna talk about five things that you're going to need in order to start applying for those jobs and the first thing i'm going to mention is going to be a github or a git lab account i think that this should be one of the first things that most developers set up it's a great way to house all your projects and to be able to show an employer everything that you've been doing and been working on the next thing is going to be a portfolio every developer is going to need a portfolio to be able to display that work that they've been committing to github and to be able to show all the projects that they've worked on the next thing that i'm going to add after that is going to be projects you're going to want to have a few projects that you've built completely on your own if you're an experienced developer this probably isn't going to be a problem for you i'm sure that you probably have a lot of side projects that you've worked on that you can probably add to your portfolio to show off for a potential job but if you're inexperienced you're going to want to make sure that you have at least three good projects on your portfolio that you can talk about during a job interview and try to make sure that these are projects that you've built 100 on your own try not to just take tutorials that you've built and put them on your portfolio that's okay if you're just getting started but when you're starting to apply for jobs you really want to show off things that you've built so you can talk about that during a job interview the fourth thing i'm going to mention is going to be a resume obviously if you're applying for jobs and you're trying to get job interviews you're going to need a resume you're going to want to show an employer all your work experience your capabilities and your education i'm going to get into some more tips for your resume later in this video but make sure that you have your resume ready to go if you're looking to apply for jobs the last thing i'm going to mention is going to be a linkedin account i highly suggest that you make sure that your linkedin looks good have a nice picture on there and put all your work history on there it's a great place for you to talk about everything you've done as far as work experience goes it's a good place to network with people who may be looking for developers and it's also a great place to meet recruiters so if you don't have a linkedin before you start applying for jobs you should make sure that you have one set up just so you can have it ready to go if an employer wants to check it out all right so once you have those five things all set up and you're ready to start applying for jobs here's 10 tips that can increase your chances to get interviews and help you out when you're applying for jobs the first tip i'm going to give you is going to be don't wait to start applying for jobs regardless of if you're a new developer who has no experience or if you're an experienced developer who is maybe looking for a new opportunity you shouldn't wait to start applying you're new to this and you don't know when you might be ready and you sit around waiting until you're ready you might wait too long if you're working somewhere and you're just waiting until the right time to leave or the right time to start applying you might be waiting too long as well applying for jobs can take a while when i was applying and interviewing for my second role it took me about three to four months to land the job and i was applying frequently and i had a bunch of different interviews i had a lot of rejections and i had a lot of multiple interviews for different companies so just keep that in mind and like i said this applies for beginners and this applies for experienced developers as well don't sit around waiting to apply because it's just going to make the process that much longer for you and the more you apply for jobs the better you get at it and the more possibilities you have of getting interviews which will also give you experience and practice interviewing so when you do come across that dream job you can nail it and not have to be nervous because now you've had a few interviews and you're comfortable talking to people who might be interested in hiring you alright so adding on to what i just said in the first tip i'm gonna move on into tip number two consider failed interviews practice and learn from your mistakes on them and use them to get better for your next interviews make sure that you note all these things down because every single interview that you have is practice for your next interview so make sure that you remember a lot of the things that you don't do well at in the interviews that you do get and go home and practice those don't let it get you down don't let it get you depressed don't let it get you upset that you didn't do well it's okay most people don't do well in their first few interviews it really is a lot of practice that's involved in being able to talk to an interviewer and being able to feel confident in your answers don't be too hard on yourself when you do fail interviews because you will fail interviews and you will mess up and you will miss questions and you will sometimes encounter questions or things that you just don't know how to respond to and that's perfectly fine but make sure that you look at that as an opportunity for the next time that you get an interview and that way you'll be better prepared for it all right so the third thing that i'm going to mention is applying for jobs is a numbers game it's very rare that you're going to just crush your first interview and land that first job immediately it's gonna take you a while you're probably gonna be applying for a long time you're probably gonna be going to multiple interviews and it's just gonna take a while so don't get discouraged if you apply for a bunch of jobs and you don't hear anything if you're on reddit and you go to any of the programming subreddits you'll see that many people often say this that they apply for hundreds of jobs and they don't get any calls back and they get super discouraged and they feel like they're never gonna get hired this happens to people who are college graduates this happens to people who go to boot camps this happens to people who are self-taught it's not a problem with you it's kind of a problem with the way interviews are done but that's a story for another video the thing i want to get across with this tip is that don't get discouraged if you send out a bunch of resumes and you're having a hard time landing a job sometimes it can actually take a while for you to get those interviews and sometimes it can take a while for you to get that job so don't let it get you down if that does happen because at the end of the day you're going to have to send out a lot of resumes you're going to have to make a lot of phone calls you're going to have to talk to a lot of recruiters you're going to have to talk to a lot of employers you're going to have a lot of interviews you're going to have multiple interviews at the same job and it can be pretty hard and just know that it can take a while and you probably are going to be applying for a long time all right so for tip number four don't just apply for jobs that you think you're qualified for when you have no experience this can be pretty hard because most of the time you're gonna look for junior developer jobs and those are almost non-existent so that makes it pretty tough when you have zero experience and every job wants you to have two to three to five years experience and even if you have experience and you start looking for jobs you might feel like oh all the jobs that i want are all senior level jobs and they want five years experience and i only have two if you have no experience you can apply for jobs that are asking for two or three years of experience just make sure that it's tech that you know and understand that you've worked in that you've built projects in and if you do have experience and you know that stack very well and you've been working in it for a while and if they're asking for a ridiculous amount of experience for a mid-level engineer and you've only got a few years under your belt go ahead and apply for that because the truth is most of the time those job descriptions are wish list and honestly a lot of the times employers will settle for good enough they want someone with five to ten years of experience but if they're not getting anyone with five or ten years of experience and you come in with two or three years of experience in the exact stack that they're looking for you could get that job i've seen it happen many times at my first job when i was helping out with the interview process we were asking for different ranges of experience and many of the times we had to go with people who were less experienced because we weren't getting people with the amount of experience that we wanted so don't be discouraged by what a job description says and don't feel like you can only apply for jobs that are exact matches to your qualifications go a little bit outside of your level it's okay it's expected the worst that can happen is you don't hear anything back but you could potentially get a phone call if you match up enough for that job and maybe you can nail that interview and land that job not having the experience or all the things that were checked off on the job description so just keep that in mind so for this fifth one i'm gonna break this down into a few subcategories for resumes first of all if you're sending out a ton of applications and you're not hearing anything i mean it is crickets and nobody is calling you back more than likely it's probably something to do with your resume so one quick thing that you can do if you are having a hard time getting calls back after applying for a ton of jobs is check out your resume and see how you can improve it if you don't know how to improve it you can seek out professional resume help but what i did was i went to the cs career questions subreddit and i submitted my resume on the days that they did resume review but the best place that i found was on their subreddit they have a discord server that you can join and in that discord server they have a resume advice channel and that channel is probably where i got the most helpful resume advice that i used to dial in my resume and start getting phone calls and i honestly did after multiple iterations of fixing my resume and sending it to people on that discord and getting feedback from it i was able to start getting interviews so if you're having a hard time getting interviews it's probably your resume that needs some cleaning up and you need to get that looked at right away before you continue to apply alright so a few more things on resumes resumes are likely to get scanned by a computer first before they even reach human eyes so make sure that you have your resume's keyword optimized so when they go through keyword scanners that all those buzzwords that they ask for and those job descriptions get hit so make sure that your resume is readable for a computer as well as for a human the next thing i want to mention about resumes is cut out the fluff hiring managers don't care about your hobbies they don't care what your pet's name is they don't care if you like sushi and long walks on the beach they want to know what you're capable of they want to know what you've done and what you bring to the table and how you can help make their company better and solve the problems that they have so cut out all the fluff that's in your resume people don't want to read that it can potentially hurt you if employers have to skim through your resume to get through all the fluff in order to know what you're capable of and what you bring to the table alright the next resume thing and this one sounds rough and it can be a little bit time consuming but you want to tailor your resume to the specific job that you're applying for if you are sending out and spamming everyone with the same exact resume for every single job that you apply for you're probably gonna get the same exact response you have to fine tune your resume you have to make sure if a job is looking for certain technologies that you've worked with that you mentioned those remember i said earlier that your resume is probably going to get scanned by a keyword scanner so if you're sending out the same generic resume to everyone and there are opportunities for you to optimize your resume for the specific job that you're applying for those are missed opportunities if you're just sending out the same old resume so even though it's time consuming make sure that you tailor your resume to the specific job that you're applying for i know it sucks but spending those few extra minutes could potentially really help you land that interview so keep that in mind and the last quick thing that i want to mention about resumes before i move on to the next tip is that resumes should not read like job descriptions it should not just say i worked with this this and this and i did this you need to highlight things that you've done you need to talk about how you helped the business make more money or how you helped the business solutionize problems that they were experienced how you help cut cost or optimize a system you need to talk about things that you contributed and brought value to that company if you want to stand out in a sea of applicants you have to make sure that you can stroke your own ego a little bit on those resumes and make sure that you stand out when someone does skim through your resume and say oh you know this person has done a lot at their previous job maybe we should give them a call because really you got to sell yourself if you're trying to get a job you can't just sound like a robot you can't just sound like a job description you've got to sound like someone that they want to hire and bring value to their company so keep that in mind for resumes and we're almost through here remember if you're enjoying this and if you're finding value in this make sure to like and subscribe with that said let's move on to the next tip alright so since i just went off on a tangent for resumes i want to briefly talk about cover letters in this tip cover letters no matter what a job application says they should never be optional they suck i don't like doing them it seems kind of silly sometimes but the truth is that a cover letter could be your determinating factor of getting an interview or getting a phone call for that job it is your chance to talk to the hiring manager it is your chance to talk to human resources it is your chance to say everything that you couldn't say in your resume it is a chance to throw in a lot of that fluff that i told you to cut out of your resume now is the time to talk about it on your cover letter but again it can't just be about your dog and your cat and your long walks on the beach it needs to be about what you can bring to the table it needs to be about what you bring to this job and it needs to be about what you offer to this company and the value that they can gain from you from hiring you i just finished going over this stuff the hiring process and getting interviews is all about talking yourself up and a cover letter is exactly that it is your opportunity to get that one chance to convince someone to give you a phone call so don't let it be optional and make sure that you always write a cover letter no matter what alright so tip number seven recruiters head hunters they are a necessary evil sometimes they bug you they send you emails if you're inexperienced and you're just getting started you may not have recruiters sending you emails all the time if you have some experience you probably have a junk folder where you send a lot of this recruiter email to if you're inexperienced it doesn't mean that you can't get a recruiter to help you my first job after applying for a bunch of other jobs i actually was able to meet a recruiter and they helped me get my first job so keep that in mind that recruiters aren't just for experienced developers now if you are an experienced developer and you're sick of recruiters calling you all the time but you're looking for a job just remember that they can really help push your application to the right person at a company now with all that said i don't want to talk poorly about recruiters because honestly i've had pretty good experiences with them but just remember that it's a business they make money off of you if they're hiring you out for contracting jobs just make sure that you're able to negotiate how much you can make and if they're getting you a direct hire make sure that you know how much you can get paid from that company and what they're going to give you as far as complete and total package goes with all that out of the way recruiters can really help get you a job so don't look at recruiters as a bad thing they're not all scumbags they're not all out there trying to trying to make money off of you but at the end of the day it is business but keep in mind let them work for you and use them if you need to all right moving on to number eight network network network network some people hate doing this you're an introvert you don't want to go out you don't want to talk to people you don't know i get that i have a lot of those personality traits but at the end of the day surrounding yourself with people who are doing what you do or doing what you want to do if you're inexperienced and looking for your first job or if you are experienced and you just kind of need to get yourself out there you can meet other developers at meetups who work in the same stack as you do and people who can potentially help you talk to someone where they work or they may know someone else who's hiring and honestly it sounds like oh the only way that you can get a job is if you're getting greased in i'll tell you this both jobs i've had i didn't know anyone at the companies that i was applying for i got them 100 on my own but i did get quite a few interviews from networking and the recruiter that got me my first job i met at a meetup had i not been there that day had that recruiter not been there that day i probably wouldn't have gotten my first job in the way that i did but going to that meetup and networking with other developers because i was learning how to code and trying to get myself out there helped me out a ton and it helped me meet the recruiter that that ended up getting me my first job so keep that in mind and don't be scared to network even if you don't want to it can be very beneficial for you and it's good to just have human contact we sit at computers all day and in front of a screen all day and it's kind of nice to just talk to other human beings that are interested in what you're interested in so even if you don't get a job from it maybe you'll make a friend or two all right so for tip number nine i want to talk a little bit more about social media i mentioned linkedin earlier in this video and how it's pretty much necessary if you're looking for jobs but i also want to talk about twitter youtube instagram and anywhere else that you can show off what you're capable of nowadays social media is huge tech twitter is huge instagram is an amazing place if you're a designer or if you're a developer to talk about things that you've made and show them off twitter as well youtube i wish i would have created a youtube channel when i first started learning how to code and just kind of tracked everything i was doing and and kind of show what i was learning and i've heard that a lot of people actually get jobs from social media because of them showing off what they're capable of or showing their journey and showing what they've learned so please keep those things in mind it may sound silly and it may seem like oh i don't want to do those things because that's how i was when i first got started i didn't like twitter i was not a big social media person and now that i have a youtube channel and now that i'm kind of pursuing those avenues for different possibilities i see the value that they have and i see how much they can help my career and i see how much they could have helped me early on so that's going to be tip number nine don't neglect social media because it can help you get a job if that's what you're trying to do with it alright so for my last and final tip don't stop applying for jobs don't get discouraged if you're just learning and you feel like you're never going to get that first job if i could do it in my 30s with a ged and a 9th grade education and no experience in tech whatsoever anyone can do it if you're at a job right now and you've been there for 10 years and you feel like you're a dinosaur and you are not up on the new technologies and you're just pretty much gonna die and wither away at your current developer job because nobody wants to hire you in the stack that you're experienced in don't get discouraged work on some side projects and some newer tech it's gonna be hard it's gonna be difficult you're gonna be applying a bunch i mentioned it throughout this video the application process for software developer jobs is grueling it's intense it's difficult and it's discouraging there will be times that you're going to feel down in the dumps because you're not getting those calls think about a lot of the tips that i gave you in this video think about how they can help you improve your resume talk to recruiters go network with people work on some of those side projects and just try to make yourself better and more marketable so when that dream job comes along you just nail it and you crush it and you get the job that you want not the job that you need and that is a great feeling i was able to do it for my second job and i hope that with these tips that i gave you in this video you can do it as well for your first job your second job or your fifth developer job whichever job you're applying for i hope these tips helped you out i hope that you found some value in this video thanks for watching and we'll see you next time", "s1HcU7taTbo":

turned into a lifelong relationship it seemed like penny was in love with Koko and the way in which a mother might be in love with the daughter except your daughter has the strength of ten men news about Koko made headlines across the world Koko who's a particularly intelligent who is the subject of the longest ongoing ape language study to date but while Penny's findings were seen as a major breakthrough by the media there were some scientists who were less convinced Penny Patterson is a overzealous mother who was very proud of her surrogate children and tens very much to projects meanings are to those children that it may not be apparent to another day there was a yawning gap between what you might believe and what you could prove these animals are doing penny believes it I think the public probably believes it her abilities to simply recognize herself in a mirror she is able to point to that image and say that's me which indicates consciousness for itself she has this self consciousness like a person does now nearly half a century after the project began the line between humans and apes is be a course in Argentina has ruled that an orangutan can be granted some of the legal rights enjoyed by humans what in tables humans to rates that other species and animals aren't entitled to with thousands of hours of footage collected over forty four years does Project Coco finally prove that animals can communicate with humans and even share their deep thoughts and feelings with us maybe these animals are thinking there's a lot more going on in their heads and maybe we thought or are there some things that will always separate us from our closest relatives how human can a gorilla be what can her brain do like a human can do", "v0sb5a4fILc": "gorilla tough we say it because we mean it and we mean it because it's true so today we're gonna be talking about something on the channel didn't really think i'd ever talk about glue glue is one of the most useful things in life you can glue things together you can sniff it and get a crazy buzz don't do that you know what's even better than glue gorilla glue of course with a name like that gorilla glue it sounds mean it sounds like it's going to hold anything this glue today that we're talking about so powerful it can lift up a truck gorilla super glue is strong enough to lift a three-ton truck a little help from a crane and an amazing example of gorilla strength [Music] that was almost too easy powerful it can stick tree trunks together five years since i glued four logs together with gorilla glue i've used no metal or noise sounding way too much like a brand deal gorilla glue is so fantastic whenever you want it a huge gorilla comes charging out and delivers it to you personally so you're probably thinking now kavos you crackhead why are you talking about glue so much well jessica brown has gone absolutely viral off the charts because she decided when she ran out of hairspray to use gorilla glue of course yep what we just saw lifting a truck she's absolutely lavared on her head her tick tock right now has 15.9 million views and this is what she said hey y'all for those of y'all that know me know my hair has been like this for about a month now it's not my choice no it's not a choice when i do my hair i like to you know finish it off with a little got to be glue spray you know just to keep it in place well i didn't have any more that baby blue space so i use this gorilla glue spray bad bad bad idea yo look my hair it don't move you hear what i'm telling you it don't move i've washed my hair 15 times and it don't move stiff where whoa my hair so i'm gonna tell y'all like this if you ever ever run out of got to be glue spray don't ever ever use this unless you want your hair to be like that you know what you know who i blame the gorilla i bet when she ran out of that got to be he just stormed in like what else what other explanation could there be to be putting glue on your scalp i mean can we blame her yes yes we can the label on the bottle is clear as day spray adhesive heavy duty bonds wood metal fabric foam plastics paper glass leather and more so yeah her head is full of gorilla glue she then proved to everyone that without a shadow of a doubt she has done this and it wasn't all for clout like people were saying by putting shampoo on her hair and this is what happened what what look look yo look look you wipe it off and nothing happens like this is the life that i'm living at this moment like this is the life that i guess i'll have to live yeah no no no no holy sh oh i do feel sorry for her but [ __ ] it out that is some mistake to make viewers on tick tock were finding this hilarious and extremely worried at the same time no you done created a helmet you got to be kidding me baby please how did you think gorilla glue it's called [ __ ] gorilla glue it's hard not to laugh at situations like this only the internet could bring us something this dumb people in the comments were panicking and offering her help try 25 rubbing alcohol and 75 water spray it on it should come right off maybe even go 50 50 or try olive oil but the first should work drench your hair in castor oil leave it in for three hours with a plastic bag and gently comb it out while spraying a mixture of rubbing alcohol water giving advice as if they've done it themselves since everyone was giving her advice i thought who better to get the advice from than gorilla glue themselves who have indeed uploaded a video cleaning gorilla glue out of your hands use an exfoliator with a gritty texture dry hands and apply lotion do not recommend using any kind of alcohol or acetone as this will actually strip the skin of its natural oils and make the glue more likely to stick this is why we don't take advice from people on the internet however tessica has been releasing updates on her tick tock in this update she said thank you for your encouraging words and ideas to get rid of this forever ponytail i will try some today when i get off from work and i'll keep you guys posted by the way if you see me walking around over head scarf or head just mind your business she then gave even further updates on some solutions she in fact tried okay so i'm about to go to bed i put coconut and tea tree oil in it and put plastic on it i'll update you guys tomorrow thanks again for the advice it coming something has to work good night everybody like that was as she said herself an epic fail with that on your scalp you need to go to the hospital that will permanently damage your hair it will stop you even growing back hair if you leave it in long enough and thankfully in her recent update yesterday she has shown that she is in fact in the hospital it looks like she's in a lot of pain in that video which obviously is awful as this was posted yesterday people on twitter are really anticipating the next update i'm so invested in gorilla glue it's stressing me out i need updates light a candle for gorilla glue girl waiting for updates on gorilla glue girl hoping she gets there soon and it's not too painful waiting for updates from gorilla glue girl like this and as cruel as the internet can be a horrible place at times especially when stuff like this happens it really seems that everyone is more worried and concerned about her and supporting her rather than trolling her someone tweeted out saying i feel bad for her showing a picture of her to hospital and then a shaved head now i don't know if this is real to be honest i highly doubt it is real however i don't doubt that this might have to be the outcome of this whole scenario i just don't see a situation where glue that can lift up a truck can come out of your hair i mean even chewing gum in hair means some people have to cut off hair i must say this gorilla glue the company must be absolutely loving the promotion this is getting it's trending everywhere i don't know what the hell gorilla glue is now it's all i'm seeing she has proved how good gorilla glue really is so people in the market for a strong adhesive are gonna see this and be like wow i really should get me some gorilla glue if gorilla glue don't sign her up for a marketing campaign they are missing out on a huge opportunity she needs it she kind of deserves it as well for all the stress she's going through it would be funny to see them collaborate her get paid a hefty sum and then we all forget about it oh i just imagine i just thought of something imagine if this was a marketing tactic imagine she was an actress and gorilla glue did this as a marketing ploy oh my god i would rate them so highly i wouldn't even care about getting duped let me know what you think down below more of a silly story however i found it hilarious everyone's talking about it comment below what you think like the video if you made it right to the end like it of course of course if you don't like this video this gorilla is gonna burst in your door and make you and yeah that is it all my socials are in the link down below until next time [ __ ] off", "VCRqONRjcfQ": "is now it's about 12 13 there's someone that two o'clock so we're just trying to figure out the schedule this is the Carlton Hotel and can it's the hotel of the stars that's why I'm standing here me and my buddies here come the police it's a police escort lots of cars with dark tinted windows another red carpet opening who's behind the glass let's take a look here we are at the red carpet this time we're not blocked by umbrellas it's been a lovely sunny day they're walking up the red carpet stairs right behind me check out all the people there's some real monsters in this business", "C-yRhovm5sE": "hey growers it's March night and here's what happens when you have overgrown plants that were too big in you have put them in a tent for your limited died I've come down to about 12 inches on the tallest tops and I've got about six of them sticking out that night the bulk of the canopies down here so this is a big screw-up and nothing I can do to really fix it at this point that back on the hearse the three grilling glues not sure if you can see it we're not it's very hard to film I don't have a lot of room and I'm staring right out the night look too much leg can it be stretched too much and no space so that's what's going on in the tent okay let's take a quick look at the room okay the 5x5 room has done much better and that's mostly because the plants were considerably smaller when they came in there right up to the height of the fan now and they seem to have stopped stretching they're starting to stack their big stalks up and they didn't stretch near as much under the 3500 Kelvin spectrum as they do under the 3000 now as you can see it's very dark down there even with the phone dried auto-adjust it's tough to get under the canopy and clean it up a bit this is a little more realistic and what you're shooting for where you got most ear tops even and this is why you want to put roots of the same plants and same species together same size same age no problems different sizes different ages problems there yeah that's what I learned during this run so far take a look at some of these nice little buds and again thanks for checking out my garden have a wonderful week good morning growers were just closing in on the end of these flowers got about seven days left start flushing them today they've all been fed it looks like we're gonna have a really nice run definitely a good yield Motors starting to build up now these are the blueberries in this corner and these are the six LSD plants over here and then one Sour Diesel and this is the big girl from the tent in the bathroom and this is one of the crop king seats bit of fog stealin on some of the votes they look unreal and there's lots of it let's take a look at some of these big colas over here on this side so they're flopping around and flopping down I'm gonna have to get some string and tie them up you got cold words everywhere so that's the main flower route and I have went through and started plucking leaves out of this side I'll clean the rest of it up tonight that's Mayer flow and light down into the bottoms so everything can ripen and that's all for this run let's go take a look at the other ones", "acaXmaqxZJA": "what's up guys you guys are telling me

like subscribe and we'll see you next time", "ra0Laa0nobU": "oh baby that's a lot of iphones right there it is every iphone 12 iphone 12 iphone 12 pro it's all the colors because you need to see them all compared so you can make up your mind about uh which one's the best which one you want believe it or not i've got even more stuff here i have also the magsafe charger i have the 20 watt power brick i've got some cases as well from later case the thinnest case you're gonna put on your iphone 12. i've also got third-party power bricks from anchor as well a secondary option to apple's power brick since you don't get one in the box this time around you can get a 20 watt charger that's even smaller than what apple is selling for less money than what apple is selling so more on that in a moment as well and then one more thing from later case because yes these displays still scratch here i have the uncompromising screen protector new product category for later case made with gorilla glass this is gonna protect your precious investment it's a two pack you can add it to your order so check that out in the description as well all right so we got the pros we got the regulars what do we have for colors let's see what do they call the mod we got blue we got white and red and green you don't get the fancy names with the regular iphones it's just i mean it's just blue red green white and black however if we switch over to the pro model we get to the fancy names all right maybe not that one that's gold how about graphite that's pretty fancy and then what about pacific blue i think it's gonna be a favorite for some people right there pacific blue in fact i think we're gonna do uh we're actually gonna do the willy blue color for later case as well so that's gonna be a nice little match right there and then we also have the silver so graphite silver pacific blue and gold in the pro model how about we kick off this unboxing with oh i don't know the blue the regular iphone 12 blue and so as you know i mean with the with the apple unboxing experience it's so special and for me this time around and i know it's a polarizing kind of topic the whole charging situation that apple is uh going with here in 2020 but it has allowed for this extremely sleek packaging i think they say it's 70 smaller than the previous version so if you pick up a power brick your very own power brick you already have a power brick or you pick up a new power brick uh well you're not gonna have to be encumbered in this package itself this one is gonna get to remain very sleek so i'll crack this one real quiet [Music] oh baby now obviously you've recognized here i have many iphones so yes you guessed it correctly i will arrange a giveaway very shortly on the channel so make sure to hit the subscribe button down below so you don't miss that here we go we lift the top oh that's a blue that's a blue right there i'll tell you what you see the cutout on the top of the packaging to make way for that camera unit now this is a new it's a whole new design i know i've handled some of the models but not the real thing yet and let me tell you it's a throwback to the previous version but it feels refined and it feels new and i think it's what a lot of users are looking for with the with the next generation iphone people were you know waiting for an all-new model potentially to upgrade then you add to it the 5g aspect and and maybe apple's gonna sell a few of these look at that blue color interesting in photos to my eye this looked a little brighter i'm not and this is slightly more muted this blue but it could just be my environment to be honest with you it's probably to my taste it looking a little more muted from what it did originally in pictures all right looking around the device we have our typical little slider here for silencing the tones of the phone we have volume up volume down over here on the other side of the unit we have our power switch elongated power switch maybe one day that will also house a fingerprint scanner to go with face id as you know in 2020 many people wearing masks some had hoped to see that on this model maybe next time around now let's go ahead and remove this little cover right here very nice and we'll go ahead and hit the power button real quick now the other interesting thing the magnets that are now installed on the back of the device in a circular fashion around the apple logo which will interface with this little magsafe charger now it's important to note with this charger it does not ship with a power brick so you will still need to bring your very own power brick to the party even if you go with this magnetic wireless charger the other thing i should note that this does work through cases and it works especially well through the later case which is a crazy thin kevlar case which actually feels a lot like the phone itself when it's installed in other words it doesn't change the shape it's about as thin as you can do with this really amazing material kevlar the only thing you're going to get inside the package is this usb type-c to lightning cable and this is another thing some had hoped for to potentially see type c in this device and since it's not there the question now is whether or not the next version of iphone could potentially be portless seeing as how long they've resisted usb-c on both sides of the of the cable however with wireless charging and they're pushed towards wireless i'm not sure how big of an issue that is so it's just a cable a phone and a sim tool and a tiny bit of paperwork it is a very simple unboxing certainly all right now before i get to all the other phones i do want to check out the power brick and magsafe situation so i have this package from anchor shout out to anchor actually for sponsoring this video they've even got a deal for you guys if you pick up their power brick this tiny little brick at the top right here is three times faster than the previous version apple power brick look at that featuring iq3 pd technology they were able to pack 20 watts into this tiny little brick so it feels like your apple 5 watt adapter and the crazy part is this thing is under 20 plus there's an extra discount because you're an unbox therapy viewer so if you need to pick up a power brick to go with your phone don't go for anything less than 20 watts pick this one up right here and catch a crazy deal on one of the best reviewed bricks that's on amazon right now so check the description for that and here's the best part the thing is substantially smaller than apple's own power brick which they're selling for 20 bucks and you've probably seen this before it's the same rough structure as their previous 15 watt power brick so you tell me what's better those are both 20 watts i think it should be obvious which one i'm gonna take it's going to be the tiny little anchor device i mean that is pocketable imagine 20 watts in a tiny little package like that check the description to pick yours up to go with your iphone or any other device for that matter 20 watts they're claiming that it's capable of 53 charge in about 30 minutes the anchor nano all right now let's talk a little bit more about magnets before i get to the other colors so this is the magsafe charger that everyone's talking about it will slap on to the back of your device nice and easily and i know people have some questions about how this thing will operate and i did show it off in a recent video however i'm going to test it out now that i have the iphone 12 here as well and so i mean there you have it it's pretty straightforward stuff and this is the design they've gone for for what reason well i think because it allows you to continue to use your phone while you're charging even if you're on wireless now it's not going to be quite as fast as a wired charger this is going to be capable of delivering 15 watts but you're still going to need a power brick over the 5 watts that you may already own in order to take advantage of the full 15 watts the wireless is capable of now apple put out their own cases ones like this uh in order to interact with the magsafe adapter but you don't have to be stuck using just these apple cases you guys know i'm not a huge fan of them they tend to get dirty i mean this one it hasn't even been in the studio very long and check out the dirt and the grime and all that so i just got the prototype in today for the iphone 12 later case which maintains the sleekness of the iphone 12 and it works flawlessly with the magnetic charger it's so thin that the magnet still makes a nice grip on the back of your device and the other magsafe accessories will work through it too where with other third-party cases they're not going to be able to do that so anyway that's a kind of cool little bonus with the later case and the kevlar material interacting with the magsafe products alright so that's the blue model why don't we switch over to a pro now how about i look at oh i don't know the silver unit this is a 128 gb version i'll be quiet for a moment oh yes very nice now obviously you notice the box is quite a bit different here we have white versus black for the pro model and they're different devices obviously the pro model adds that extra camera module a slightly different look i'm noticing already this blue model is picking up some pretty significant fingerprints because well it's a glossy finish it's a glass finish however on the uh on the pro model it's a little less evident because it has this kind of uh brushed or more slightly more matte finish now on the white model that is uh even more protective against fingerprints however the edge of the device might be a different story because this is made out of stainless steel it creates a slightly heavier device as well and i know it looks good but that is also of course going to attract a few fingerprints although as you can see i mean it's not the end of the world it's a very flashy look to it so let me remove this piece and yeah actually you know what it does it does get a bunch of fingerprints on it on this model with the stainless steel coloring let me see how this one works out the case that is perfect as well now i should also mention that the case will come in a cyber edition with the the full coverage in the camera area but since this is a prototype it's not showcasing it so you will have cutouts for the separate modules including the lidar on the final version of this particular case so the white model here i kind of like this brushed look to it i think it would probably be my preference over the standard model fingerprint magnet however this blue color might be a little more to my taste than a white phone beyond the stainless steel exterior and the extra camera module and the slightly different surface on the back otherwise you're talking about a very similar experience here now let me just ah this is kind of an interesting finding the uh the pro model is slightly grippier with the surgical grade stainless steel this aluminum frame on the non-pro is actually a bit slippery by comparison so i'm just going to put that out there anyway the other components inside the box are exactly the same spending the extra money on the pro is not gonna get you any extra accessories all right let's go back to the non-pro side why don't we check out the red model [Music] it's of course product red portion of the proceeds go to product red and i've heard some comments that this thing is not really red and they're kind of right that is not red it's uh almost like a coral it's kind of an interesting choice product red in the past has been really punchy red this is not the case this time around and you do have the little product red designation in this location down here product red coloring around the side as well which is a slightly different tone from the back this is more red the aluminum around the outside compared to the back panel which is sort of shifting a little bit more pink this is also interesting inside the package with the paperwork we get a little product red extra oh and i missed this on the other model there is an apple sticker hidden in there a single apple sticker to fit into this particular unboxing experience all right back to the pro side oh guys also be careful with the screens on these things i have already seen tweets on my timeline of people scratching these things simply by placing them near another device so be very careful i know apple said it has the ceramic coating and that may do something for drop protection but everything i'm seeing online right now is that this thing is when it comes to scratches it's it's a little bit weak right now so definitely be careful with it or go ahead and install something like this the a screen protector this one what we worked on is getting it as flat as possible one of the beauties of this generation of iphone it has a super flat display so it makes installing a gorilla glass screen protector really easy to do so we worked on the fit and ease of installation and this actually comes with two screen protectors so if you screw one up you throw the other one on there and and you're protected all right back to the pro side this is the gold model 512 gigabytes i like the little gold accent on the front of the box gold apple logo that's the attention to detail right there now it's subtle i'll tell you what it is subtle but man this thing is coming off like jewelry right now you see the sim card tray surgical grade stainless steel but it's got a little more coloring a little more pigment to it same thing goes on the back it's subtle though as you can see it almost looks like a white phone but there's a little bit more to it you see the difference there that is white versus gold and i'll show you the sides as well so let's go ahead and just peel perfect add gold to the pile all right we are almost halfway through here back to the non-pro this is the white so we're gonna actually get to do a white comparison v12 versus 12 pro interesting that has a kind of a pinkishness to it once again that's strange so this white feels more like a pure white this white has some sort of pinkish undertone very strange color decisions here from apple i'm gonna put that right below so maybe you can see the difference also something interesting here on the white model of the non-pro they go ahead and put you know have the mirrored apple logo here it's so subtle you barely even see the apple logo in fact on the white model pro all right fine how about we put this over there back to the pro side oh is this gonna be the the one for me probably so this is the graphite model and you know i just like those tones i like to keep it simple i like the dark tones so this is probably the one i'll slip the sim card into i'm guessing maybe pacific blue let's take a look nah it's probably gonna be this one it's probably gonna be this one so this reminds me a lot of the previous generation pro model so it not only changes of course the color of the back plate it changes the color underneath the camera cut out so the actual camera units themselves become slightly less pronounced they kind of blend in a little nicer and then the edge here has the darkest of the bunch for the surgical so far but also of course the biggest fingerprint magnet as well which kind of kills the vibe ever so slightly still that will probably be my choice of the bunch since i'm gonna put a case on it anyways not such a big deal that almost has a little bit of greenishness as well i know this is it's all very vague what i'm saying here and maybe or maybe not it shows up on the video itself but this almost has a little of last year's greenishness to it very interesting all right what do we have here this is the green model this is another color which has been a little bit controversial online people say what type of green is that kirk was calling it easter green it's a sort of a minty green maybe it's hard to pinpoint what you'd call it it's a soft green maybe like a pastel green but they just call it green and uh as you can see there it well i mean it's kind of unique amongst the bunch it's close to white i guess out of these and when you look at it from the front you actually pick up the green frame quite a bit same goes for the red model of course as you get into the darker units you pick up the frame around the front side a lot less and then the pro models you just see that shimmer because of the surgical grade stainless steel these do feel more premium immediately because of that stainless steel it does feel different in the hand compared to the aluminum and the weight of the device overall is a little bit different all right last one on the pro side and a possible contender for my ultimate choice here compared to the graphite model this is the pacific blue a deep a dark blue this model is a 512 gig as well maybe it gets the edge for that so here we go all right that's a tough call right there graphite versus pacific blue it might be a tie for me however i have to consider when i go ahead and slap the case on which is the better look and i think the graphite is just i mean the graphite just meshes better now i know this is going to have full coverage but the graphite even on the sides over here i mean it's called graphite it's just it's going to mesh better with my case of choice so and if i'm not going to use a case at all if i want to roll like that then this pacific blue is probably my favorite of the bunch it's subtle but it's there you know that it's blue and in certain lighting the blue pops off a little bit more and the surgical grade aluminum around the outside in blue it's just i mean it has a little bit of specialness to it so it's worth considering as well all right the last very last one of the bunch it's black regular iphone 12 in black it'll be a popular choice just because that was a little aggressive every day you can use it not ever get bored of it because it's a classic choice classic selection however this one is super glossy so get ready for fingerprint town on the black model actually i'm going to be kind of boring here and tell you that if i was going to pick up the regular 12 and not the pro i'd probably be picking up the black model as well so anyway so there you have it that is every single iphone 12 that's currently available unboxed in one single video all right it's time to pick my personal iphone out of the bunch of course you know i got to slip the sim card in do the latest apple experience shift away from from android that that one time per year so it's not going to come as a surprise to you my selection is right over here it's going to be the graphite iphone 12 pro and i'm going to boot this up i'm actually going to install a screen protector real quick and then also slap a case on rig it up exactly as i would so let's go ahead and run the setup you gotta appreciate apple's default background there wallpaper that diminishes the notch very significantly now i do kind of notice the fact that we're dealing with a 60 hertz display i wish they would have done 120 at least in the pro models but with the 5g and the slenderness i mean they worked so hard on the slenderness of this device so i kind of get having to make some compromises your battery can't be as big and therefore you have to make some choices about 5g versus let's say 120 hertz at least for this generation so i do notice the 60 hertz thing a little bit however i'm sure i could get used to using 60 again i've used 60 for so long so you see how that goes but scrolling does look better at higher refresh rates no one is going to dispute that it's a question of how much better we have a beautiful oled display here and even though this is this has a fairly large screen the whole thing well there's some confidence in holding it because of that flat edge gives you slightly more grip than the i mean it just stands out on your fingertips compared to a curve it might be it's comfortable it might be a little less comfortable than having the curve there but there's some extra confidence that comes from having those rigid edges all right now as mentioned earlier this particular display uh yes they put the ceramic coating on there and all the rest of it but then i started to see the posts coming up of people saying hey you might want to be careful with that display because some people already got scratches on them you don't want to do that with your brand new phone especially you spend this kind of money so i'm going to go ahead and do the full rig on this one and show you the process as well it's not hard you don't need to be intimidated so this screen protector is made with gorilla glass so it actually kind of feels like you're just touching the phone display it doesn't have that tackiness to it like some other screen protectors it feels like glass it is glass all right so inside the package it's two of the screen protectors we got some some wipes to keep the display clean and some dust removal stickers plus there's a microfiber in there as well you may or may not need to use it depending on if your phone is brand new uh you probably want to install one of these shortly after purchasing your phone and the cool thing i mean i'm really proud of these screen protectors because there's so many bad ones out there the cool thing about this one i'm telling you right now you do not even notice that it's on there because of the combination of the design work from apple to do this really flat screen no curves around the edges and the material in use on this particular screen protector it you just can't feel it you just can't even feel that it's there so it's really just a bonus for you let's go ahead and apply it now so you get this little red tab here it is very straightforward just peel off the red tab that's the back side grab the two wings just drop it on you draw a line down the middle it starts to fill out the sides you peel off the top layer like this and boom glass on glass it's hardly noticeable it's barely there and then what you want to do immediately after you just take your microfiber and if you do have any tiny little bubbles which i don't think i do on here but if you do you just kind of push them to the edge it's really it's amazing it's the easiest install that i've seen like i said i haven't been a huge screen protector guy in my life but then i saw this one and the the implementation on the iphone 12 and it converted me so that's why we have it as a later case product and as you can see on the install around the earpiece like i'm no professional at this but like check it you can't even see it and then if you do slap this on that even adds to it because now you can come right to the edge and you you never even feel it but now you have the scratch protection what am i talking about scratch i'm talking about scratch but i'm talking about scratch protection see but that's just a knife but you get the idea it's a little bit of extra security if this thing gets messed up it's no big deal you got an extra one if your whole main display gets messed up that's the rest of your life with that particular device so anyway that's how i'm gonna have mine rigged up it is the graphite color as you can tell and uh and it's fully is fully protected and ready to go yet it still feels like an iphone 12. all right so this is my pick out of the bunch that's my rig it is the graphite 12 pro i'm gonna stick my sim card in it's that one time a year where i get to use an iphone a little more extensively the rest of the year is filled with so many android releases anyway let me know down in the comments which model you would go for would it be the graphite iphone 11 12 pro the white model would it be the pacific blue could it be the gold of this bunch right here or would you go for the regular iphone 12 i think willy do was saying he prefers the value point and there your options are black of course product red which looks a little bit pink the white model the blue regular blue not pacific blue fingerprint blue or the easter green pastel looking green color let me know down in the comments which one you would pick and yes of course

I'll show you more into that later on but for now have a great day", "1BtEY7ShFSE": "what's up guys so uh today uh is a video that uh some people have been asking me to do like commentary on the raid videos so i did a i did a post out on my channel uh a couple of days ago saying that um whoever wants to have their raid video uh commentator on so that they could have a uh some advice on like maybe how to build certain characters that they use or how to do different play styles within their within their game play so the first one we have here is uh by dancer x he said to check this video out and uh his blue beetle almost one shot boss gorilla garage 850k hits so we're gonna see he made his blue beetle into six star um his multiverse uh basically all of his characters on in this roster right now is uh six strikes up for csm right here not not rostral i would say lineup um so csm you don't have to have him at six stars for his passive because at five stars you get to max out his passive where his special two decreases defense in this case gorilla grodd you might want to decrease some defense so your damage dealer can have some more effective damage on on the boss so we're going to take a look at this i'm going to make this full screen and we're going to see how um so by the teen threat number that you could already tell these are not high threat characters but that's fine threat is just a number in this game and uh you can kind of have a sense that some of these characters are not fully built even though they might be sick starred it may not be the best optimized build and uh we make we're going to make videos like this to advise the players of how to build their characters blue beetle oh the sound is a little bit loud um all right so he built his his blue beauty blue is that six stars level 60 gears which is maxed and level 10 all blades so he's going to show the size stats in just a second so he has 4.7 k attack which is not bad but six stars usually around the 5k 5.2 5.3 k attack is ideal um defense you don't need defense if you're simply using them as a damage dealer sold energy just you don't need defense at all all you have to do is build up a combo with your tank or combo builder and then tag in tag your damage dealer in this case will be blue beetle and uh do your special then tag right back out you don't need defense because the boss is not going to hit you so he has critical damage at 251 which might not be as high as i would like it to be um usually around you you aim for the 300 percent but there are times where your rolls would uh would not add up to 300 so you'll end up like at a 292 or 286 and then you instead of wasting an extra in this case 35 critical attack damage so it will be overboard you don't want overboard uh critical attack damage because that's just wasted material so instead of going and maxing it out you reach 286 292 and then you whatever space you have you transfer for attack and get more attack so 251 critical attack damage not bad i do have a feeling that this is maybe a little overboard the critical attack chance it might not be just 75 might be a little more but let me see if he has any other stats to show so he has no fast attack which you don't need for blue beetle um yeah so pretty much base stats he has some resistance in his gear or talents so he's going to start the battle now ideally you build up a combo with multiverse flash and then if you have enough power at that time you tag in csm do special to decrease defense taxis and back out because most people don't like to build or don't build their csn they don't bother to build because all you're doing is a special too and it's not even a damn retailing special too so let's see how he plays it gorilla grodd perhaps one of the annoying uh bosses all right so you're tagging your damage look first you got to be careful because on initial tagging you have to be very wary that you do lose some health every time you tag in your damage especially well only if you have the all blades equipped you do lose health every time you tag it so you got to be wary of every time you tag in make sure the opponent does not hit you because it will be lethal if you're not careful so as soon as you have enough power if you kept tagging out if you take out twice you'll basically have most of the time enough power depending depending on the power generation of the characters so as soon as he was able to you see he did the special two for csn therefore decreasing defense so he just died because he didn't probably didn't build your csm all right so another thing i got to say as soon as you're losing um health so judging from the way you're losing health with the basic attacks when we're lagrange i would suggest if you're using multiverse flash solely for tank slash combo building like building up a combo for your damage you have to tag and do a special i would advise putting multiverse flash giving him a lot of defense hope preferably at around 70 75 percent and then resistance resistance is key especially against attacks on gorilla grodds where you have to block to uh like mitigate the damage and just decrease it from whatever special he's about to do so from what i can see the power that your health bar for multi-use flash is decreasing a little more than i would like you would like especially if you're using him as a common builder like you are um make sure you put resistance uh and then defense defense is priority because it's the better stat of the game of the characters to like uh go against bosses so defense is 75 or around 75 and resistance is the highest you can get without sacrificing your defense you have enough power to do another special tool right okay take it back out okay so i know you have the all blade no you have the father box on your multiverse flash i think i'm not mistaken this is the dashboard okay you do have father box so i don't know what level your father box is but just know that you got to keep in mind that the health boosts and the attack boost that the father box gives to the character that is equipped does not apply to normal rates so you have to be aware of that it only applies to solar rate events so in the solar events whatever health or attack boost that this apocalypse artifact gives it specifically applies to that mode and not to normal rays now blue beetles blue beetle specials is not a very costly so it's like even without doctor fate or anything it's it's five bars for special three so you could easily just hop in if you if you don't care about the super move damage you could just straight up go for the first special three in like less than 40 seconds in why did we get a picture and you could see he did 466 so with if you had the chemical attack damage maxed you would have had around i would say 490 to 500k damage per special three especially since since blue beetle special 3 is one hit it could be very lethal against the bosses 856. so you could already see how much damage you're doing against again also with tagging in and now you're increasing the all blades boost multiplier for each um each of the attack stats that blue beetle has every time you tag out with all blades if you're within that certain time limit you are multiplying the damage properties for that character so good thinking on that one nice call on that tag out you don't want to lose too much health on your damage dealer okay good thing you're regenerating good thing regenerating oh no so close be very careful with that bet not bad 700 let's go be very careful with this because okay one thing about the teleportation that doesn't work teleportation is supposed to be supposed to work exactly how we were supposed to dash against a projectile that the opponent throws but for some reason teleportation still doesn't prevent us from getting hit from that projectile okay mind if we get a picture okay so one thing i must say when you tag in blue beetle or whatever damage dealer you do for a special three or whatever special make sure you do like the full combo before you do the special three otherwise you see the timer here the timer here it's they're still tagged out you can't tag them back in until their timer runs clean otherwise so if you do if you jump straight to doing the special three again like this he might be still be able to do a special or basic move on you and you will die before being able to tag any of the other characters so make sure when you tag in your damage dealer make sure you're able to do okay this might not be ideal for characters such as batman where you do your special three because their special three takes time but for special threes that don't take time like blue beetles make sure you do the combo string fully and then do a special three so by the time you finish your special three and the boss is still down you could tag in another of your characters and uh save your damage dealer get a picture after but i will cross you how [Music] the question of the matter is okay so a few things to note make sure on your tank or combo builder you have defense preferably around the 70 mark and then you have the rest of it resistance and health those three key things are essential to a tank slash combo builder if you want to build one for blue beetle specialty is amazing it's quick one hit no pain well not for you for there's bitters pain for the other boss um make sure you time it so that when you tack in blue beetle to do a special three do the full combo string so that by the time you do by the time the special three of blue beetle is complete you're able to tag him out and tag the other character back in so the other character character could take the damage from the boss and not your damage dealer um so far um keep keep doing what you got to do and uh just make sure your timeout you time the tag-ins and then uh make your tank or come builder healthier um by putting more health not feeding your vegetables or anything and uh yeah that's that's gonna be it guys so if you guys have any um video submissions you would like me to look at and provide commentary on it maybe i give some tips here and there uh you can join my discord which i'm gonna leave link down below submit videos there and we'll do it from there or you can

The rep that it gets for holding it's grip is legit. - Okay, so I'm not mad about this product. It didn't flake up. The little curls that\ndid pop up are shiny. It didn't flake, but this isn't something\nyou can just slap on and go.

simple vapor thank you mark I do appreciate it and I've had this one for a while it's been it's been a minute and I'll tell you when I first got this juice you know I I pretty much baked it right away I was really intrigued by by the you know by the flavoring via gobby you know do you use agave and as a sweetener in my coffee or my teas and things like that you probably didn't know this about me but I lead a lot of organic stuff and you know it's just it's just kind of one of those things but this is an organic talking channel and never will I start one but but I do like it so you know it is something that I kind of have you know pretty regularly and when he when I first vaped it I was like oh and I was like Mark Breaux you trying to kill me over here like it's just it's not cool man why you send this to me mark like that's not right bro and anything I'm just kidding seriously am I gonna you know I do appreciate it but it was just really really harsh and the flavor was really weird and after letting it sit for a while you know having went back to vaping it and its really good now it's really really good so let's go ahead and have a vape and then we'll talk about what we're getting you know I'm not into fruity vapes and fruity vapes is the only thing that really comes to mind when I vape this it's just definitely not fruity at all but it's just more sweet like that there's no cream was no bakery none of those elements but you know and and as far as what a gobby tastes like I don't know I taste the tea that's now sweetened that wasn't sweetened you know ten seconds ago so I have no idea what actual gobby tastes like I'm land unless you're talking about tequila I mean it don't taste taste like that agave it's not really it's not the same not getting any tequila saying you know it's no margarita here it's definitely not a shot of patron so maybe the best way to describe it would be that it tastes like a honey it's really sweet I don't know how to describe it exactly but it's really really sweet and and it's just got like this you know this honey type flavor so that's the best way I can describe it cuz obviously agave is its own flavor it's Divac leeward so way I'm up here on e juice direct they do have it for 22 99 for 120 little here bottle and it's pretty good you know it's pretty good I wouldn't want to buy a hundred twenty little bottle of it if you're just checking it out if it kinda is something that you do like and you want to check it out I wouldn't buy 120 ml bottle just to be on the safe side but it is really good and I don't know what happened to it you know maybe it needed the steeping and and it helped but it definitely is way better than when I first baked it and maybe it's just mine my RDA maybe it's just the bill cos you know which I did not say but we are rocking it on the pulse 80 with the b2k now maybe maybe it's just fact that I'm on the b2k because a b2k does get loft just awesome flavor compared to a lot of my other already all of them all of them not a lot take that back all of them so yeah thank you guys for watching I do appreciate it check this one out I'm gonna be linking it down below you

gorilla versus flex or flex versus gorilla in episode one we compared their tapes in episode two we compared their glues or construction adhesives in this episode we're gonna compare their sprays that was my spray anyway this is jeff with jeff reviews for you my channel is dedicated to viewing mostly as seen on tv items i look at some consumer gadgets other household items once in a while i do a little bit of a diy just because i like to if that interests you i would love it if you would subscribe to my channel and click the bell below that way you're notified every time i release a video just like this one one more thing don't forget to check down the description for my social media instagram facebook and twitter i would love it if you would follow me there too now let's take a closer look at these two sprays to see if they're any good i actually bought the same exact item on amazon two different days apart just so i would get something in the same box and yep they came same size box this one is blue that one is the brownish color so this one i'm going to spray in the flex seal and this is actually blue and this one i'm going to use the gorilla waterproof patch and seal and i'm going to spray the insides of the box and then after i'm done sealing it i'm going to fill it with water first up is the gorilla waterproof patch and seal i've shaken the can for a little while and it tells me to hold it between 8 and 12 inches away from the spot i'm spraying now that's going to be difficult because i'm going to get it in there but for the most part i'm going to try that if i have to get into these little corner pieces where you can see light coming through then i'll probably stick it in there but sweeping motions that looks good for a first coat i'm gonna let it dry now onto the flex seal i don't know if you can see the corners but it kind of worries me i might end up using a lot of product just to cover it since you last saw these boxes i've actually flipped them over and sprayed the bottom i wanted to make sure i can get around the edges and the corners on both so that's one coat on the bottom for both boxes i will flip them back over and spray the inside again i just wanted to show you this here i have two coats on the inside and the out of the gorilla waterproof patch and seal and the flex seal spray i let these boxes cure for an entire week just to make sure but now we are going to fill them with water to be honest with you i am a little nervous let's get the hose filling up the gorilla box i'm going to fill it all the way to the top and then i'm going to fill up the flexbox all right fill up the flexbox all right we are all filled how about they look like little swimming pools very cool so let's check back in on him in an hour and then maybe tomorrow when i first saw this i was a little sad because i thought water had been leaking out except the boxes are just spreading oh i think this is actually holding four hours into this and they're both losing water pretty fast i put some bricks here just so they wouldn't spread out that way but they're definitely leaking they might be from the bottom parts here they're both leaking i actually think the flex box is leaking a little faster than the gorilla box but we'll see in the end so it's been 24 hours and there's no water left in the flex box there's a little bit of water here left in the gorilla box so i guess the winner would be the gorilla but they're pretty close although not a scientific test first round if we're doing rounds goes to gorilla there was more water in the box at the end of a 24 hour period than the flexbox that's just the way it went in this one now what we're going to do is we are going to i'm going to drill some holes in some buckets or water bottles and then we're going to spray them and then we're going to fill those with water just to see if they will be water tight let's go do that here i have two buckets that i've put 20 different size holes in each bucket has the same hole size in the same location there are 20 there's 16 on the bottom and then four around the side so i'm going to do is i'm going to spray the outside and then we'll see if it could hold water [Music] [Music] all right with the first coat of spray on you can definitely see where the holes are let's see if it'll fill it [Music] just finished coat number four on both of these and guess what happened i'm all out i didn't buy any extra cans and i have to order some but i do want to show you this it's actually looking pretty good a lot better than i thought some of the larger holes are being filled and these ones are slowly getting filled the small ones are definitely covered already they're looking pretty comparable this is one of the larger holes that was filled there but i'm pretty excited i actually didn't think it was going to work but now i have to get two more cans it only took four days and i got my two new can so let's continue this project before we continue on using our second cans now i wanted to show you something so when i did my review or comparison review of the flex glue clear versus the gorilla glue construction adhesive i was wearing my flex seal hat why because they sent it to me in the mail i even made the comment i'm not supporting one company over the other they just sent me a hat well guess what gorilla company sent me a hat as well so i'm sporting it in this video now let's get back to spraying these buckets we're gonna do the same process as before i'm going to spray an angle 8 to 10 inches apart same process with the gorilla waterproof patch and seal [Music] i find that coming in at an angle you stand a better chance of plugging these holes i've just finished my sixth coat and honestly it looks as though the flex seal is doing a little better you can still see there's a little bit of an opening here and that's about it on the top the center one is full and the other ones are starting to get filled well if we look over here of course the fly landed on that let's see we get that fly off all right fly fly away okay so we have you know a few of these have been filled but the ones in the middle are still open now we're gonna use the up the second can just to see what it looks like at the end but right now it looks as though the flex seal is winning tell me what do you think so far of this challenge who's gonna win the bottle challenge gorilla or flex quick let me know down in the comment section below i would love to hear from you let's continue spraying these bottles i'm getting ready to do coat number 13 and as you notice right over here on the gorilla side it's filling up really really nice and it looks very similar over here on the flex side i will say i want to show you this difference of the spray coming out now because the gorilla spray is coming out much thicker almost clumpy um i think that's why it filled up real fast so i might take a different angle and show you what it looks like when it's spraying out now so we have just finished our 15th coat and i think we're good doesn't look like any of the holes are poking through anymore you can still see the spots where the holes were but i think we're pretty much covered i used a little bit that was left in the cans to spray the outside of these bottles um i wanted to try to spray the inside a little bit at least on the bottom but well i don't have any left so we'll see if this does not hold water then i'll order some more cans but if it does hold water this will be awesome i'm excited to see what happens right here with the bottles because the spray is actually on the outside and not the inside so you can sort of see where the little spots are covered and so i'm going to fill both buckets up with water and we'll see what happens now that the flex is full let's see if we can fill up the gorilla bucket i'm still filling it up hasn't gotten filled up all the way and we've already sprung a leak here you see that pulling out there from the gorilla bucket because i'm not willing for this test to be over in the first five seconds i've got a little piece of gorilla tape that i'm going to put on there we'll see if any of the other holes pop open so the flex bucket is holding strong and has not leaked anything this one on this side the gorilla is leaking and i can tell that the table down here is wet so it's probably leaking out of one of the holes in the middle i just don't know which one whereas the flex one still has the water up to the top i am gonna leave these out overnight we're gonna check in on them we're gonna have them out a full 24 hours and we'll see what happens in the end so this is an interesting turn of events it got frosty oop it got frosty last night so these have frozen that's awesome 24 hours later the flex bucket is still full to the top and the gorilla bucket is down about an inch maybe almost two i did prop this up on bricks because i wanted to see what was up and i found a little water droplet comes here every once in a while so it's just an ever so small leak that has formed not to mention where's my shadow i did have to patch it because it popped out immediately but pretty sweet well round two goes to flex seal but how do you end in a tie i don't have any more tests but i will say as i sprayed through the entire bottle of the flex seal it was smooth from start to finish i can't say the same thing for the gorilla spray because towards the end of that it sort of was like sputtering and it got clumpy i'm not sure if that was the nozzle part or what but i did tell a definite difference with the spray so if you have to have a winner there you go the flex spray the spray from start to finish was really really smooth in my opinion both sprays are actually pretty good and i think you'd be happy with either i do like that the flex company has a lot of different colors i thought that was pretty cool and i really like the blue this is jeff with jeff reviews for you as always thanks for stopping by and i hope you have a great day i wanted to show you the inside of the cardboard because i did go underneath here and spray and i was underneath here and sprayed um but my thoughts are the water just found its way through and got into the cardboard and really messed it up i guess if you had four or five cans of the spray you probably could seal it off pretty well and make a thorough job but i only had two cans anyway i just want to show you the inside of the box i really do appreciate that you stayed around for my entire review where i compared flex spray against gorilla spray you know what during this video i referenced episode one and episode two episode one is where i compared their tapes i'm gonna link that video right up here episode two is where i compared their construction adhesives or glue i'm gonna link that one right up here i would love it if you would click on either one of those links and by the

money but that's the price to do in business right that's it's just a thing anyway we have a great show bright blue gorilla which is the husband and wife team of robin rosencrantz and michael glover are on the show they travel around the world making music showing their movies um it was such a fun conversation and this is part of my little 15 minute promote your project podcast series where we just put out a quickie and sometimes they don't have anything to do with commercial making but it's good that we just open our eyes up in our minds and we learn about other disciplines that are somewhat tangential or adjacent to what we do and and they're just good fun so i hope you enjoy robin and michael i know i did we had a great zoom and uh i'm gonna put some links at jordanbrady.com to some new stuff they got that they're pimping i hope everyone has a safe holiday i'll talk to you soon robin and michael i figure that i've enjoyed all the videos and the uh the movie trailer and the live performances ah this is amazing well we try to stay busy it keeps us out of the pool hole [Laughter] now here's my here's my opening question this show is called respect the process it's about commercial filmmaking right yes and you reached out and i said well it's first of all it's musical comedy it's a husband and wife that love each other and create together i'm a sucker for that sure come on the podcast but my question is what do you want to get out of this uh just you know a roof over our head and maybe a hot meal inner peace we want to you know our goal has always been to make uplifting music and movies right and our goal is when people leave the cinema or leave their computer vod nowadays that they feel better than before they started watching our movie or listening to our music yeah we find because we've been touring for 30 years as bright blue gorilla as a band wow so yeah and we're still doing it well we would be except for the pandemic but as soon as it's as soon as we got our injections we're out and so we'll go touring again but um we've been doing it so long and what one thing we've noticed the whole time is that in the beginning of every audience every audience is kind of closed up and a little bit a little bit freaked out they just are and then by the end of our shows though they're like ah looks like the muppet show they're all smiling happy singing along it's really nice and so that we noticed that early on you're both kind of like muppets and i mean that in the most uh loving generous way well that's a good thing to be no i think we are but you know what's really fun as filmmakers because i know a lot of a lot of your listeners are creative people is like michael was saying we tour around the world with our films we go to art house cinemas music clubs festivals even people's living rooms where we set up a cinema like pop-up cinema like pop-up cinema and we we start the night you know with an unplugged concert usually play an acoustic if we can that's our favorite way to play but it's a really nice way to meet the audience get to know each other and we often have a sing-along on some of our songs so you get the audience to relax and have fun what's the go-to sing-along it depends on what it is we have a song called labor of love we have one called give me a continent or a brand new me brand new me brand new whatever whatever it feels like right all about change and do they know this sorry do they know the song going in or do you teach them oh we just you know we teach them yeah and we joke about it so that they don't feel you know because everybody it feels kind of awkward at first singing but then we have jokes about how scientifically it changes your brain and increases your likelihood of you know getting a nice a date if you're single and things like that right i love it and okay couple of questions here first of all i love musical comedy right i was part of one of the most popular uh folk pop duos of of the 80s i kid but um i was waiting to hear what the name was we were we were called fetterman brady we actually did some television appearances but the whole thing was a goof like it was it was just a spoof so we had about a 10 to 20 minutes set and then we would say to the audience who remembers what was on the b side of that single after we did a you know a planned song and someone would go i don't know and and i would just go that's right i don't know and i'd look at my partner and we would start singing and we would riff i don't know so it was a premise heavy concept and it was best live right it was more performance art than a an act so my question is are you booking big blue gorilla uh as a film and then you get the music or are you booking it as a musical experience and oh by the way we have a film the combination of the two yeah these days bright blue gorilla is is a you know it depends where we are because in in the netherlands we've performed as bright blue gorilla so many times musically that a lot of times music clubs bring us in so if we you know but mainly it's the movie it's the movies nowadays because they're getting kind of popular are a weird little comedy it's like a special event mainly and we really um now we're doing a lot of art house cinemas so they say hey it's a feature film and a concert and a q a after yeah that's the nice thing is that we we watch with the audience and then we'll we'll do a q a and as filmmakers it is the best way to learn by watching your film with audience after audience after audience and yes sometimes we watch our film a hundred times i mean it's it's crazy in a way we're a little crazy but it's a new experience with every audience and i the nice thing is you know michael writes and directs i produce and we wear all the hats because it's independent filmmaking but i find myself still laughing at the jokes because with every new audience it's a new experience yeah and when it's working it's so inspiring it's like oh they're getting the jokes oh this is fun it's all it's very rewarding to hear an audience laughing especially you know well when i'm also the editor i edit the films you know because i it's like robin said was kind of do it yourself although we have a big team this this for this 36 husbands we had about 300 people involved making the picture so it's not a small team it's big but i run the camera just because i don't like working through a cameraman you know because i having to tell somebody no up more no back you know it just slows it down and i've had dps in the past but i just i light faster i know what i want it to look like and you know so i do and it's a lo-fi aesthetic yeah it's basically as low budget as you can possibly and um and we we we don't try to make it seem like it's it's not right right and a lot of times the the movies are self-aware even sometimes a character looking into the camera going like what's happening you know that kind of thing and uh it's it's uh the thing about being the editor while we're touring oh yeah the first several shows are our test audiences and i adjust the cut as we're touring for the first like 12 shows charlie chaplin used to do that with uh he would take one or two reels to the coal miners after they would have a heart day's work and he'd show him a five or ten minute reel and he would see where they laughed and where they got it and he would go back and and trim but he's so great he's really one of my heroes absolutely absolutely absolute genius you know uh i interviewed willie nelson one time okay and uh he said you know in between the the when you take a break and you're starting out why don't you go out in the audience and sit and and say howdy and you know have a beer you don't have to have the whole beer but you just say thank you to the people coming to the show and they may ask a question and then when you come back in a year or two to that little honky tonk and you got your new album they're going to come support you and and it wasn't like a diabolical plan and in fact he goes now they know that you meet a lot of people and you don't remember them but they know that you remember the face and they appreciate it and i think that's what you're doing by um and i've talked about this on the podcast before you know serving your smallest sustainable audience not that it's small but that it doesn't have to be uh like you can be niche and have your own cult basically absolutely and all that's part of the fun people yeah i love that's great hearing that from willie nelson because we find that i don't do the impressions michael that was just yeah yeah i put a little twang on it yeah i don't know if you're aware of your hair your hair grew as you were doing it and braided itself yeah it braided itself it was really wild i wish that people could see it but um yeah yeah you know we the way we tour also is not hotels and that kind of thing we stay with people we've been doing that before oh wow occasionally we get super weird yeah and we travel and we travel and tram and we've got our guitars on our backs and we're wheeling our bag and michael has a high-end projector in his backpack so when we do the living room uh films you know it we and speakers we travel with little speakers so i always like well how heavy is it how big is it can i carry it and so because we just literally like she said on trains usually and sometimes buses but trains usually not really rental cars in australia when we tour we have to rent a car but that's the only place but but the thing is with um with the the staying with people it's been such in the first few years it was a little awkward we weren't used to how to do it but by now 30 years now we're going back to old friends usually you know after 30 years of touring so now we know so we've seen their kids grow up every couple years we tour again and oh my gosh in some of these countries now their kids know how to speak english you know i was speaking speaking broken dutch yeah the few words i knew to the kids so it's been really neat so now we have a worldwide family and then every time we tour of course we're meeting new people but that's what makes it special and it's and it's a the concerts are very intimate even you know if uh you know sometimes it's a small crowd even in a bigger crowd sometimes we'll get people to come up on stage and play an instrument or you know i like to go sit in the audience and take a photo with the audience you know just to connect connect in that way so it's uh it's very interactive now now tell us about the united states where can people see you or and let's assume that this conversation that's taking place in october of 2020 let's assume this is an evergreen loving conversation someone might hear it a year from now and there's a vaccine and we're all traveling right for for 20 years from now they're going to be looking back at this alien civilizations will be looking back at this podcast and so so basically right now we're plugging 36 husbands our new comedy film and that you can find on amazon on apple tv on google play on the youtube movies where you can rent it i'll put links at jordanbready.com with this blog with this podcast that's great and as far as us where they can see us in the united states we're not touring right now because because of this but normally we normally don't tour the u.s we do some shows in la sometimes in new york uh we've we've done two tours of america do you remember the borders books and music stores oh yeah i remember those well i remember a for the younger listener a bookstore was where uh imagine a kindle where every page was printed on a parchment and it was it was bound by some sort of uh thicker thicker paper almost like a cloth like a cloth and then and then a merchant would arrange her shop with thousands of these an actual shop you walk in it yeah no i love that jordan well no there's two things i want to say i i want to tell him real quick about borders and i want you to tell the story of our our um show in germany that time where you made the joke about a book that reminded me but but we were one of the first bands to tour all the border books and music stores i literally called up each store individually and said hey we're that was before we were making movies but i said hey we're a band we want to come to or do an in-store event and uh i pre-sold cds we did an event in the store and you know some of that was cool but some of it was not very much fun they were like you know parents have their kids and the kids are like making faces at you while you're playing all gun magazine in the corner you know now i did the one in l.a in west l.a there was a borders and upstairs they had a little corner it was like a curved uh like a bay window uh and i did a spoken word thing there oh cool that's yeah i remember no it was not cool it was not i mean it was weird because people just sort of hobbled chairs from around the store and you know people standing like you said they're thumbing through you know uh you know cat fancy magazine and the the the espresso machine and the what the milk foamer during your beautiful moments yeah it was a good idea at first and we had all these gigs and they pre-bought all these cds but then we're like oh my gosh now we got to play all these shows and it wasn't very we were touring in our vw van yeah i mean it was fun we were staying at like beautiful uh camping grounds and restaurants yeah so a couple tours of the us but europe has been much more fun for us right it's also we're we're americans and so we're used to america i mean i i like it and everything it's our home and god bless america but it's exotic for us to be on a train going through the middle of the night romantic yeah yeah it's just it's just it's still romantic even now europeans come here and they go oh america's so great you know it's the route 66. it's the romantic imagery we have uh that we've all things we've always dreamed of and that kind of thing so we tend to tour europe now we're touring australia a lot and in the united states we do occasional gigs here and there yeah but tell them about that that german germany robin's talking about i made a similar joke about what a book was this is quite a while ago but it was several years ago in germany and the audience got up and applauded standing ovation because i was telling the young people what a you know i was totally like oh boy they're really serious about this that's funny it was very funny so yeah you know it's it's it as you're you know you're a filmmaker you're an artist you're you're uh you're a international celebrity uh and you know you know as we do that you got to figure out a way to get your creations out there and you got to figure out a way to make some kind of humble living with it so we're always trying to figure that out well that is a good reason to come on this show and i'm going to implore you listeners right now to check out the links that i've put at the website and download no buy rent whatever and just enjoy the silliness that is the big blue gorilla bright blue gorilla oh my gosh we're big we're so famous wow no a lot of people say that blue gorilla indeed there's a guy in a gorilla suit oh yeah we do have a gorilla a dancing gorilla in 36. that was in one of the scenes now this is we shot that in berlin in the summer and berlin does not have air conditioning they they know about it in theory but they don't use it and so this is a kid not ac yeah yeah this poor kid was was uh dying in that thing you know and we had to take him out of it and phantom off give him ice water you know they didn't die our danish assistant director is not used to the heat and he he literally almost passed out we had to feed him bananas and ice waters michaels a dancing banana too i don't know if you caught the dancing banana but i did not see that it's it's ironic that i would screw up the name but then you would have to remember that you actually have the bright blue gorilla guy in a suit so team this has been so fun to chat with you thank you for for coming on the show and i again i employ the listeners click on the links buy the silly stuff and let's keep this dream alive thank you so much we appreciate it thank

well right now i will share with you how to unlock the gorilla arms and the animal knuckles because these combined will definitely help you defeat each and every single one for that side job before we get started i have a huge 20 21 goal of a hundred thousand subscribers and would love nothing more than for you to join and be a part of this journey so be sure to tap that like and subscribe button for more silverback guides coming very soon and let's get started alright so no doubt that everyone and their household are going google happy looking for the best weapons in the game at the moment but these side jobs titled beat on the brat require you to use your fists only so if you're not well prepared you could end up like nate robinson and we definitely don't want that to happen and you're going to need a few items and perks to make sure that you get helped out as much as possible first though let's discuss the side jobs themselves within the game eventually you will get a call from someone named coach fred who will suggest you enter some fighting tournaments to make a few eddies for this you will square off against five fighters in total with the first four being around the city once you have completed these fights you will then be asked to fight the grand champion himself razor hugh who is extremely tough to defeat now if you're having trouble with this fight i have a video suggesting some tips that helped me and i'll link that in the description below for you guys to reference either way defeating all five will net you some serious money or eddies though it's definitely worth doing if you're looking for something challenging but i do want to obviously state how you can acquire the gorilla arms and the animal knuckles because these are going to be absolutely critical to those fights now for the animal knuckles you'll need about 5 000 eddies and can buy them from the ripper dock located right here on your map now what make the animal knuckles so important is that they apply a bleeding aspect to the enemy every single time that you land a successful hit if you look at the gorilla arms they only have a 20 chance to add that bleeding so if you pair that with the animal knuckles you're always going to make sure that there's a bleeding aspect on that enemy this will be very very important for blocking hitting and letting the bleed damage take place and then rinse and repeating that process for the gorilla arms you can actually buy them from victor who is another ripper docked once your street cred hits around level 20 and the price varies depending on the rarity so for example i bought mine for a hundred thousand because they were legendary and then having the gorilla arms installed cost me around 50 000 eddies so you're gonna need a good chunk of change to do this but either way if you're having money issues i have a super easy way on how to make a ton of money then i'll also link in the description below so you guys can follow that and of course money makes the world go round especially in cyberpunk 2077 so make sure that you check it out either way once you have the gorilla arms attached you can then add the mod animal knuckles also just a small note but if you have the ripper dock install something and pay for it you won't need to actually pay for it again only new items that have never been installed before will only need to be paid for lastly if you can't find the gorilla arms on victor walk out of the store skip time for 48 hours and then walk back in and their inventory should change now from what i've seen online there have been other ripper docks that will actually sell the gorilla arms so you could check a different one if you're just not having luck with victor but again you can skip that for 48 hours and then their inventory should change so i do hope you found this video helpful and if you did leave a like and subscribe for more guides coming very soon let me know if you think gorilla arms are worth it or if you have an easier way to defeat razer hue in the comments below thanks for watching and i'll talk to you guys soon peace you", "PJ-b7o6RFCE": "this morning I want to take a closer look at baby

you write this well I shouldn't waiting to see if they like it before I say hell yeah your mom was packing no mom isn't going anywhere you are Billy um your mom and I are getting rid of you we're sending you to an orphanage oh no Billy this is a nice orphanage it's run by a group of nuns that you're really gonna like and they'll be lots of other kids there you can play with all the other boys and girls whose parents didn't want them look I know this means leaving your friends here behind but your mom and I have already talked with most of them and fortunately none of them seem terribly upset you can take some of your toys with you not many as the rooms at the orphanage are very small most the rest your mom and I will sell on eBay we're thinking of putting the money to our turning your room into a personal fitness center but Billy we don't want to have to do this it's just that lately lately there's been so much back talk to that dinner table and just the other day I nearly

you a quick glimpse at a super easy project to do that will help you tremendously around the house let's go okay quick video today got other projects brewing you can probably see them right here not gonna spoil the thing stay tuned later for that in the week now has this ever happened to you yeah i'm really not that happy to make this this is not how you want to start a video i'm telling you right now um i cut it i cut it the wrong way i cut it the wrong orientation um okay so like it flexes like this a lot right but honestly that's it's too short now god okay so i'm gonna take you over here and show you the one i made a few weeks ago um man that really sticks right in the crawl man i'm telling you right now um what a bonehead mistake okay so all right let me show you what i got i mean this is one of those quick glimpse any projects anyway this is one that i made a few weeks ago and it really i mean it's been trained even more because my goodness anyway this is really handy they are commercially available we had one it's called the quick can um i'm actually gonna put a picture of it here um yeah but that plastic it was 20 bucks wasn't that much you can't buy it in store you got to order it through homedepot.com and then pick it up at the store so long story short is that ours um sat out in the sun which wasn't that i mean even if this out in the sun it might become brittle and it did and it started to crack started to break so it works great it wasn't as big as this one this one is fairly large five feet now you could buy flexible eighth inch plywood from the big box store and cut it make sure you cut it the right way and bend it around it does bend the entire eight foot span not the forefoot span so cut what you need it works well you can get it pretty inexpensively even in today's times so one of these things is one of these things i don't even know what to say i'm just frazzled i cut the damn thing the wrong way and i'm sorry okay but as you can see this thing works pretty well and uh it does it makes the arduous task of taking care of a 200 year old live oak in march uh in the southeast united states um a little bit a little bit easier so hope you enjoyed it hope you got some use out of this if you have leaves to rake at all this is uh one of the things you need to go build yourself all right i'll see you on later this week i got more projects coming for sure i'm not sure if they're in the shots here at all but some of them might be enjoy i'll see you later did you say don't run what what is it marshall marshall is he part of the paw patrol yeah yeah awesome", "qX6t1DN3xYc": "[Music] 36 husbands and daughters mystical musical romantic kung fu spy [Music] hi this is michael glover and robin rosencrantz we are bright blue gorilla okay so i'm going to read the question and then we'll answer it so first 36 husbands was self-released you don't work with a movie company does that mean you want your own control 36 husbands is our seventh feature film and like all our films we decided to self release self distribute and basically build a movie company to do what we love now we do have a distributor that puts the movie on video on demand platforms like itunes amazon different places like that so we're not alone in it but as the creative uh force behind the films we we are truly independent yeah and you know way back in 1990 michael and i met in los angeles at a music club and we ended up writing a love song fell in love that's what happens when you write a love song that's right and that was when we decided let's quit our jobs in los angeles let's sell everything we have and buy one-way tickets to amsterdam yeah we've been touring the world ever since and making music and movies and it's it's been an exciting unpredictable adventure that was never boring for one single second sometimes it's scary but it's never boring that's true but we decided to create our own content because we didn't want to wait around to get permission you know from a company to do what we love next question how did you gather people around you to take part in a project like this film after 30 years of traveling we meet amazing interesting talented people everywhere we go so every couple years we reach out to our friends and say hey we're going to start a new movie do you want to take part in this film 36 husbands has about 300 artists from i think we figured out 30 countries to take part in it that includes all the dancers all the people that took part in it and it's a really uh labor of love really everybody's there because they they enjoy the idea of the project and they're they're they're there as artists to support their fellow artists and what's really neat is everywhere we shoot around the world like 36 hudson's was shot in australia in berlin frankfurt dortmund paris los angeles everywhere we went people opened their homes to us for us and our actors to stay but also locations whenever we see an interesting location and we know the person that that owns it or runs it will say hey can we shoot a scene in here and sometimes i'll actually write a specific scene to take place in the various places that we find next question is michael has written the film or did you have input on this as well i do write the screenplays but robin and i always talk about the ideas and we kick around ideas and robin is a producer of the movie i'm the director and writer but she's a very creative producer so she has input all along the way including even the editing yes i don't know how to technically edit but michael and i are a pretty good team together he'll be working on a scene for hours editing this way and then it's really fun to work for eight hours and have somebody come in the room and say oh it doesn't work right no but cheap but she has a reason why it doesn't work and that's what i what works yeah so i'll come in with the fresh eyes and then then i'll say hey that's great or i think we need to cut a little bit here so we've really been a good team but the neat thing with independent filmmaking is you have to wear all the hats so you know we cast it we cater it we find the locations we build the props do the camera do lighting do everything we learned how to do it over seven features seven feature films so next question can you tell our listeners about the story or the film of the film without spoiling too much a mystical musical romantic kung fu spy comedy so 36 husbands is a mystical musical romantic kung fu spy comedy starring three powerful women and a bunch of husbands that's the idea that i had behind the film what i wanted was a story that showed women in control women in power and women really running things which i think would be a very improved situation personally so we wanted to also have fun it's a comedy we wanted a lot of music in it and so we wrote a lot of songs and put ourselves in a tv show called the bright blue gorilla show that plays on tv next question what about the music in this film all bbg songs and instrumental we had a lot of fun writing the songs for 36 husbands and as michael mentioned as bright blue gorilla in the film we have a tv show so we got to write a bunch of short songs and they're really social commentary our goal is to make them part of the story we wanted to make sure every lyric every text that we had in the song had something to do with the film and that would move it forward and the songs also work on their own we just released the 36 husbands soundtrack so even if you haven't seen the movie it's fun i think to listen to the songs yeah maybe maybe better if you've seen the movie because then you'll understand what we're talking about but we tried to make them clever and fun and melodic and and there are some instrumental songs and some have lyrics it's a big mix of styles as well that's what's fun about working on songs for movies is that we can write in a lot of different styles one song that we're really happy with is the theme song from the movie sort of our theme it's called love potion number 36 and we were we wanted a song that was like kind of a rocking tune that would talk about women being in control and fortunately it's it's turned out pretty well and people have been been downloading and playing it and uh we're really happy with the i had a lot of fun singing love potion number 36 i got to use my rock and roll voice very [Music] too nice and it smells like glue and i really need to do the trick use love potion number 36. [Music] [Music] it's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it [Music] delilah played the game too fair when she cut off samson's hair she could have shrunk his number 36. [Music] gets deeper as darkness falls and the missiles don't you think it's time to let the women drive potion number six love potion number 36. next question in the past you have lived in amsterdam for some time but you returned to la again felt homesick or do you have more opportunities over there so as we were saying in 1990 we bought one-way tickets from la to amsterdam but we didn't actually stay in amsterdam we knew one guy living in utrecht so he picked us up at the amsterdam airport and brought us to utrecht actually marsenbrook we stayed in a very a small town a beautiful home on a canal our very first night in the netherlands but we really fell in love with holland and for the last 30 years we always uh tour holland but lately we've been spending more time in berlin and our lives are really project based so people say where are you from where do you live the thing is we once we started touring we never stopped touring so we weren't in netherlands for a while but we i one thing is we played we've played in every single little town in the netherlands at some point we played we stopped counting at about two thousand i think shows in in the netherlands you've never heard of yeah people say oh you wouldn't know it i'm from a tiny little town or i'm from a beach town you don't know it we say what is it they say haven't again i said oh we played there so it's like you know we we love holland especially in the early 90s there was a terrific club scene there all over the country and we really went everywhere through most of the 90s and as time went on we branched out into germany other places italy we go to australia a lot now india we spend a lot of time in india whenever we go back to netherlands though it's a bit like coming home it's very nice yeah it really is but we also when we're not on the road we will be in los angeles for periods we have still have family and friends here and in los angeles we like to focus on films and tv here as actors and also songwriters we've had some pretty good opportunities here like we were in an alec baldwin film called the last shot you can see you can find that it's still going around on all the internet portals uh the last shot with alec baldwin matthew broder and la really is a great place anything can happen here and even though we had to leave la to really create a career in film and music we still love coming back and you know things can happen here too you never know what's going to happen next okay the next question says 36 husbands can be watched on apple tv we'll play the title track of the film can you tell us more about that song i already talked about that song so i think that's good the next question are you busy with other new plans at the moment so right now as we know we're all in lockdown with this pandemic michael and i were actually on the road in australia touring with 36 husbands it was going great right and we go around the world we do concerts and movie screenings and q a in art house cinemas and we thought god this is what a tour of the the abc radio that's the national radio they're playing us we're getting all these invites everything's terrific and it's like what is corona corona what was that what huh and all of a sudden everything canceled so we got the very last united flight out of melbourne back to los angeles it was quite a surreal experience the empty airport and we're the last flight out yeah but now you know we're in los angeles and we're uh feeling good here because we're with our family my parents are 87 and 91 now so it's good to be at home helping out and it's easy to stay creative when you've got a partner like michael yeah we we spend see the thing for us we're usually touring which we're really busy and then we stop touring between tours so this for us is very similar to just a normal between tour lifestyle we stop what we're doing we sort of cocoon we go in our home and we just write new songs we write new stories we create new things and prepare to go out again now this time it's a little longer of a cocoon who knows when will tour again right we hope 2021 will be out we'll find out but we are creating and it's life goes on somehow that's right so we wish everybody inspiration and joy in the netherlands and we hope we can come tour again in 2021 and donkey bell in tots scenes thank you you", "SfsugGshTgY": "your mind

together what is it that from I know it's gonna be game growing episode I know but they're making fun of somebody oh there may be one of a guy who is trying to be a AVGN Oh fair enough yeah it's one of their best that's their best work from one of it at least it's good it's a good episode is what I'm trying to say I'm like that over Samoa was that a was that a sonic episode no that was a um that was a Mickey Mouse Capades oh where the entire episode was this Aaron doing like a bad ABT enim impersonation the whole time it was pretty good yeah unfortunately like a lot of their videos just blend together because it's almost never about the game so I can't place anything the only time where it's like actually about the game is when they're actually both playing at the same time that's true or sonic 06 because you can't not talk about something that was their magnum opus though and they never finished it nope and it's probably better that way probably can you imagine like it what if they got like Ross and Barry to food shop for the sonic 06 man now I think it needs Danny I think Danny needs to be the one playing too just like himself hahahaha the only kidding grumpy yeah that would be perfect [ __ ] but perfect hmm well I didn't work or alternatively buried by himself because he was there but not there and yet I think that would actually work better oh that did Mark an open the bridge is this took a while yeah it did work it just takes a very long time Houston easley aim we're being made fun of for promoting game grumps well that's not to talk about stuff that you're a fan of though like actually difficult [ __ ] that's a lot of people's I forgot if you're in another area yeah your bullets don't travel through because that would be really really really cheap uh I know I know there are ways of like shooting people through the doors I figured it out once I was like wait you can actually sort of do this but it was dumb nonsense hey is this uh no this isn't a mission where we fight the boss roots good the next one is yeah I don't yeah I think the next the third mission is where we fight the boss okay cuz we're gonna be really closely at that platform I feel a platform of amazing fun times are about to happen you mean I think we do have to fight one of the big guys though oh yeah that jackass oh oh no I mean there are three of us and your ranged i shelled did you figure out how to equip those spells by the way not yet we haven't really stopped okay we can stop after this fight it's pretty common I'll help you out are you playing on keyboard or controller keyboard okay I'll help you out I hope that everyone in that is watching this is enjoying the diversity of enemy types as much as we are honestly I find it kind of therapeutic playing this game like even if it is like very pared down and like minimal compared to most MMOs yeah it's like the combination of nostalgia and just like the fact the fact that this game is cooperative without being like massive open world I actually had on kind of revolutionary in a way like this in Diablo actually turned me off of the world of warcraft formula well part of the world of warcrack formula doesn't really work is that if you're going after the same creatures in the environment Hills don't count for you and they get your loot and it's just like oh ok so hard abasic ice technique fitting linear pack or heal so should I try using the magic heels more than the potions yeah it saves you a little bit of money let's leave you some cash and I believe you heal allies with the tube but it could be wrong thanks no I don't know ok a technique that restores HP if I level it up it might be able to heal those around me maybe you know I think that I kind of enjoy helping MMOs more so than like regular games I for whatever reason I prefer I I really enjoy lping multiplayer games yeah multi ruins for sure the like I really want to do I want to go back to my dragon age inquisition LP but the more I play it the more I realized a I want something else to talk to here and be why the hell did they just make this cooperative and just have like other people play is the like pre-existing NPCs and just yeah role play is the MER well I mean I started as a as a duo and then my partner dropped out pretty much immediately remember that and like when we did like saints row 4 I was like man I remember how fun it was to do doooo stuff we should I keep wondering you record that but then I keep being like hey let's go play PSO as we have the third person or okay i got my skills in in check so now i haven't I have a magic attack a normal attack and a heel so that'll be interesting that's part of the reason why I wanted to be an elf even though I absolutely love being robots uh I totally be a robot but the robots the coolest part of this game all right time to time so use my magic attacks just cuz said fire any you do the fire and I'll do the ice oh I was doing ice I know that's what I meant to say i'll do the fire you do the ice get your blue and your green mixed up everything else yeah i'm not apparently cydia colors today do you regen your uh your TP no not you don't read you know that kind of sucks hi I think like I was like being the bouncer of that door I'm an elf so I can ? it was part of it oh I don't know that oh well that's kind of cool actually alright so this is back at the start um yeah well we have I wish you could like pull up the bigger maps you could look at it I think we have to head back for that platform of doom yeah I think that's where the UH the big guy won't be hanging out I just don't remember the big girl and it gets this way luckily you don't have to like go through too much to like backtrack food I mean every level in this game is a big circle oh yeah I see it I fat I see it I have to fight some rap ease yeah we we weeeeee it the other way yeah right because everything is a big circle yeah yeah do you guys use the regular attacks in the power attacks I i switch actually I leave with the light attack cuz uh it actually Machar's the focused attack the heavy attack a little bit faster so I'm gonna take the guy in the end I don't you take the one in the middle it's a lot harder to get the mullahs melee that's I'm arranged characters all just be able to pop off shots on all of them yeah as soon as they get up there's gentle yours is up yeah I got it he dropped it I what is it a frame green frame I take it I already have a green frame I think there's a fire attack over here shell by the way oh okay cool i'll even though i have the ice one already I'm gonna see if my equipment can be upgraded at all is there anything better nope i'm wearing the best barrel like I think that um your character clot I think that pretty much any character that can learn spells like does not have a limited number they can learn but they can't learn every single spell unless their buffet unless they're like the the weird elf girl the phone new morale or whatever it was yeah i mean that's no accident oh there's an antidote oh hello I don't remember this thing oh hi pillar David giant pillars monument you know someone this the thing that makes everyone crazy for the end given the recent events I think it's more thorough investigation those works out of 50 letters anyone get the 2000 watt the 2001 a Space Odyssey joke Ilana hot dog sorry i was reading Danny was talking over all right I'm um I'm not on the platform yeah same for I really wish they had actually gone like fourth farther into the story like if this game actually had like a truly legitimate like a sectional story i think i would have forgiven it a lot more like small faults yeah like the bid all these films the plot was very nice hey by the way bird if not get worse too goes on sale you should pick it up at some point okay it wasn't sale for ten dollars not long ago yeah i mean honestly I think I'd rather play through a little bit more like plot focused MMOs I think that could be kind of fun to like strong armor pod gnomes into as well he's just think you good strong arm gnomes in anything just because it's true doesn't mean they should just been like you know gang yeah whatever yeah that that's the thing now with strong Armstrong on the domes yeah I mean don't pretty much do anything because like it won't even upload it in the end so it's true like I mostly just invite him I'd like if I was if I was like concerned about getting YouTube get kickbacks I'd be like trying to find people of like oh yeah that thing you just pundits yeah I can't see it because I wasn't looking the right direction it's a big big jackass you have to hold the bear yeah oh yeah there is there he is no I don't just find a lot more of dun worry about it got it actually did he's a lot weaker in multiplayer just because they don't scale up enemies Trish is nice yeah yeah better that way cuz they have to get the scaling wrong or always got two of them I forgot about that yeah usually I find what happens if they overcompensate like pretty dramatically and just make them like way too hard I'm gonna turn scale off enemies oh there's another one directly behind me isn't there yep yeah well oh shoot it to hell the blue yeah hardly what I usually do not realize these guys came and call it came and colors swap versions also bird every time you power attack him from behind he gets stunned that's it that's part of the reason why you're kicking ass that's good i got wow these guys are that's a lot are there three of them know there's just you i think that's it for the big bertalan asses you're not you're not doing much from in front Oh fine I'll girlie I'll go shoot him in the ass there early they hit the hill the blue was actually like comically easy because you kept stunning the [ __ ] out of them all right i'll keep i'll keep shooting them right in the butt cheek berries they do not like a guy looks plenty daytime there we go you can see who kills and didn't you kill nature row them congratulations you have destroyed three endangered species y'all the blood splatters everywhere yeah but then obviously it's not people blood yeah it the only thing that I think is not a jewel in this game as the character animations everything looks like they're waiting for a bus like listening to their iPod yeah there should be fair idle animations are not like I don't know as well put it fairly well I I guess maybe I'm too willing to forgive this game because I keep I keep saying you know year 2000 goodly because I mean to be fair she does have a really awkward mover like run around but that like NPC in the kind of central area outside of the principal's office yeah kind of like just glitches all over the place it is weird", "5MohPuT2kwU": "hello everyone and welcome back to another hands of blue review today we are gonna be taking a look at Six Gun gorilla long days of vengeance but before we do that my name is Peter Sharon a veteran of the video game and movie visual effects industry lover and a critic of comics and so let's get into this this is a nice big thick hefty book and basically what this is is the first kind of six chapters of the story of Six Gun gorilla so basically if they broke this up it would be six individual comics but they put it all together in this one awesome book with this fantastic cover art right here it's Volume one Once Upon a Time in the West I believe it's about 98 pages total by Brian Chris Digga and Adrian sabar I hope I didn't screw those names up too bad sorry guys and today we're looking at this book right here show that back here a little bit of artwork I mean he has some big old cannons we'll get into that but today I'm checking out this book finished reading it and because right now brian has the next chapter on indiegogo right now that campaign so you can actually get the next part of the story episode 7 basically and you can also get it in a cool feature perk where you get the new episode and you get this book as well with some new awesome artwork done by cannon white so that is a really cool thing if you're into comics and you should go and back that I will put links down in the description for this so let's get into a little bit here we'll read the back real quick says we've all heard the stories we've all heard the legends wieder Doc Holliday the kid there's a secret history of the Old West one that seems too strange to be true but then we all know what they say about the truth lovingly illustrated by Adrian sabar again hope I didn't mess that up that DC's Batgirl and I'm passionately written by a newcomer Brian Chris Chris Chris dog I'm so bad with names I'm sorry guys 6k gorilla long day of vengeance is the critically acclaimed story of a very big ape with very big guns blowing very big holes and very bad people and and it is just that it's a it's a really fun read like honestly I picked it up started reading and I didn't want to stop the only reason I had to is because I had you know go do things unfortunately that are real life stuff issues so I had to put it down a couple times to go do that but you know as soon as I got back from being able to do that I I got right back into this book so I could get it read and share it with all of you wonderful people watching today so and it's really neat like I'll kind of see if I can flash through here and catch the pages because each time there's a new kind of chapter that goes a little we get like a really cool I know there's one somewhere around here that's avoiding me so yeah like everyone's like when they kind of end a story to be continued we get a really awesome piece of like artwork that they someone did this is Wes Huffer we did this piece and see if I can flip through and find another one so we got this one here which is really excellent you see him you see him grabbing the little guy's regular-sized gun compared to his big old hand cannons and so it's really cool how they have a lot of this you know like this one is one of my favorites too just really excellent stuff like for all the little kind of chapter parts and another one but I think there might have been one more let me see let me see if there is another here I think I want to oh yes here we go right here you know so we get so between each kind of little breakdown we get some really cool art which is really neat till I kind of have that little piece in there but so this starts out you know with you know what humans do they go and like to go hunt for things and you know usually very much so overdo it and someone you know ended up finding our hero here as a little baby still alive and they decided to take him with and in a game of poker like always in the Wild West this gentleman was able to play some cards and win our little our little hero here as a little baby gorilla and he takes him into the circus where he basically learns how to you know shoot guns and very accurately at that and very good and he becomes kind of like the big star of the of the circus act but not only that like this guy's you know he's a really kind of rare breed of gorilla you know who this guy teaches to actually read and do sign language and uh and this is kind of like you know his fostered father and he has his little daughter here who kind of becomes like you know the sister to him leave there might be let's see if I got a picture of her well here they are kind of talking doing some sign language stuff as they're packing up camp getting ready to go but basically a gentleman kind of comes into the way or kind of comes into our story wounded hitched a ride kind of as they're traveling and you know kind of way except to see our our hero here khumba and his name is coumba gosh I keep on forgetting but yes and you know so there's a little little misunderstanding a little fight that goes on but uh you know like in all great stories something very bad happens and you know and some very bad man come along and do some bad things which basically our hero here isn't really happy about and so he seeks out to get some revenge on on these men that came through and kind of wrecked you know kind of hurt his family you know it's just the circus and stuff and so he goes out looking for him to hunt him down and you know and just like like the dialogue is really good in this like the way they talk you know it's all kind of old-school cowboy ish kind of stuff and it's great you have you know our hero here you know on his uh wagon the sweet hat you know the poncho kind of style where and he just basically comes into this barn this Rex house which is absolutely fantastic just putting huge holes through people you know and then at a point kind of puts the guns away and drops the guns here we see and he's like alright let's get into this and starts having a huge bar brawl with all these guys I mean so there's action to this whole thing super excellent getting to see our our hero just you know whoop alot of but on these on these bad guys and just you know show them just how much of a badass he is and so it's kind of a story of that and you kind of find out what's behind all this stuff and the that guy that they're you know we're looking for and this kind of like goes back a little bit to before the bad stuff happen when he's reading but yeah I mean he just this is one of the guys he hunts down and I mean I love this shot right here but he just does tries to do like a you know standoff and you know he just takes him out and that gun just basically takes his head off and flips him all the way over and he just goes back gets his horses and you know it's all good on to the next target but they go on a cool adventure here go see some old friends you know cuz the first Brook that the gentleman actually taught him to read was uh you know the Bible because he wanted him to learn that the good word and all that but you know he also reads a whole bunch of other books and everything as you'll see throughout and you know trying to find some stuff and and uh got his sister here not gonna give away any names because this is out you can get this and you can read this for yourself so I kind of want to be vague about stuff so you have to really go and check it out but I mean it's awesome you know it's like what would you expect from a very intelligent you know gorilla who couldn't read you can sign language you can shoot guns better than almost anyone and you know is also very strong and likes to you know rampage through bad guys that's always a good thing and so yeah they where they get into a shootout with some of these bad guys here and you know the story goes on they gotta find their way out and find out what's gonna happen here like at this point yeah he gets on the little minigun there and starts cranking out the bad guys like letting them get a little taste of their own medicine and you know that's kind of where we end off going into our our next episode here and but uh yeah really really fun story really enjoyed it you know there's all kinds of all kinds of great just like the action in it a lot of the stuff the story a lot of back story that they kind of go through if like you know younger growing up this part you know where he's teaching them to read the Bible because that's kind of you wanted to have make him have good morals and manners and you know and that's why he you know and the the one gentleman here I forget his name but you know he has there's something there after they're trying to find this guy to get something and so you know and it's always because of some you know rich pompous he kind of guy that you know is looking to try and get a gun bunch of wealth or power and things and you know and what's he do to try and achieve that he hires really bad individuals like this guy here to uh to go out and do a lot of dirty stuff so that he can come in the end and pick up all the pieces and you know claim all the riches so yeah excellent excellent comic excellent stories all parts you know I'm excited to see what happens in the next part you know I love some of these drawings like the face here you know just really really good stuff and yeah like I said like I love all these little individual pages but yeah if you want a really good fun and interesting comic you know that's just a little bit different than a lot of stuff I've been kind of collecting and showing off you know a gorilla with some gigantic let me see if I can find the picture where they kind of really show the size of these these guns yeah so here's like a good example the stuff you see you know the ringleader of the circus right here and here he is kind of loading up you know one of his guns and I mean that thing is just you know massive but to him it's just a regular old peashooter you know kind of thing and so yeah very very fun very good book like I said like excellent story the the writing like the dialogue really entertaining and yeah you know if you're into the indie comics or looking for something different in comics because you like to read them and you like good stories and everything definitely go

"Phoenix six a fire Phoenix six pro can you tell the difference that's in the shot [Music] hey everyone welcome back to my channel my name is Dave Dylan with Chase's summit calm in this video I just wanted to answer some questions that were asked in the comment section in my last video where I reviewed the Garmin Fenix six against the Garmin Forerunner 945 lotta you had some great questions and I just wanted to answer a few of them in this video I think the most frequently asked question was the difference between sapphire and Gorilla Glass today I have the Garmin Phoenix 6 sapphire here and I also have the Garmin Phoenix 6 Pro which features Gorilla Glass instead of sapphire in this video I just want to talk about the comparison between the two devices and really what's different about before we get into this make sure you subscribe down below and give me a thumbs up if you thought this was a helpful video also go over to Chase's Summit comm and check out more content like this and if you're at all interested in purchasing your Garmin Phoenix 6 please use the affiliate links down below it costs you nothing and it definitely helps support my channel I've got both devices here so let's take a closer look alright so I've got the Garmin Phoenix 6 pro here and I've got the Garmin Phoenix 6 sapphire here so the Garmin Phoenix 6 pro features a Gorilla Glass DX display which is basically what you have on your smart phone the Garmin Phoenix 6 sapphire features a sapphire crystal display which is basically a synthetic gemstone that's created in a lab so the only thing harder than a sapphire display is actually a diamond so these displays are very durable the only downside to sapphire is actually transmits less light and it's more reflective so the visibility of the Sapphire display is a little bit dark and reflective you can see here when I kind of move them around the lighting in this room the Phoenix six Pro is a lot easier to read at different angles this is the Phoenix six sapphire my right hand and the Phoenix six Pro in my left hand I just wanted to bring these two outside so I could give you an idea of what these look like in direct sunlight and in direct sunlight there the visibility is about the same it doesn't really matter how I move them around the Sapphire doesn't really make a big difference out in direct sunlight although the Gorilla Glass is definitely a little less reflective spoiler alert I will not be trying to scratch these watches in this video I pay for the stuff with my own money and unfortunately I'm not rich enough from YouTube to do that from my experience though the Sapphire is very durable and the Gorilla Glass while quite durable is not is not scratch proof so I would suggest putting a screen protector on it and I'll show you what that looks like now right now I have a 37 millimeter tempered glass screen protector installed on this Carmen Phoenix 6 pro it's really hard to see unless you look very closely from the side you can kind of see the lip there but it's very low-profile it's really it's really not bad but it does add a little a little cloudiness to the through the device so if you compare that to the Phoenix six sapphire to me they're they're about the same in visibility right now you can kind of see the reflection of my my light coming off the watch is there so with the tempered glass installed it's pretty similar anyways I'm gonna pull the screen protector off now and we can take a look without it one thing I did find interesting when comparing these two is when the backlight is on like it is right now the garmin phoenix 6 pro actually has like a bluish washed out tint to all the black whereas the phoenix 6 sapphire has a much crisper higher contrast display and this is only when the back lights on so i don't know if this is a variance in manufacturing maybe they're using different LCDs from different vendors but it's quite noticeable especially when it gets darker out so what you're looking at here is the Garmin Phoenix six pro on the left and the Garmin Phoenix six sapphire on the right and these are both in my pitch-black bathroom and I just wanted to give you a look at what the difference is in backlight color are I thought this was kind of odd the Garmin Phoenix six sapphire which you see on the right here has much truer blacks and deeper blacks in the Phoenix six Pro on the left here it has like a bluish hue to it that and when you turn it at different angles it actually changes the color of that hue it's pretty odd I'll just open up one of the widgets here this is a run widget and you can see again the Phoenix six sapphire has much deeper blacks and the whites pop out a bit more in the Phoenix six Pro has that bluish hue to it which makes Volokh visibility a little weird totally functional it doesn't affect how the device works at all but to me I the deeper deeper blacks so the guts of the Phoenix six Pro and the Phoenix six sapphire are identical whatever you can do with the Phoenix six Pro you can do on the Phoenix success sapphire and vice versa and they're both feature a stainless steel bezel and back along with the heart rate sensor with pulse ox blood oxygen saturation so they're basically the same exact watch the only difference between these two devices is the material used for the glass and also the coating used on the metal parts the Garmin Phoenix six Sapphire features a DLC or diamond like carbon coating so what that means is it's a lot more durable than the standard coating I don't have a lot of experience with this coating I've had this watch for a little while now and it's still flawless but time will tell how that holds up moving on to the Garmin Phoenix six pro the pro version comes with the standard black coating you've seen in the past this is a PVD coating this is used on a lot of watches and market it's very durable but it's still not quite as durable as the DLC coating on the Sapphire model like I said I've managed to scratch other watches with this type of coating in the past and because it's black the scratches are very noticeable so the color between the two watches is slightly different the dlc sapphire version comes in a carbon gray and the pro comes in black the carbon gray is a little bit lighter and I think that will also help with scratches if this bezel does scratch a little bit it may not be quite as noticeable as it would be on the black the only difference is the type of glass use and the coating on the metal everything else inside there is identical the guts are the same you're gonna get the same exact performance from both watches so you got to ask yourself is it worth it 100 bucks you get the sapphire it's a little bit more durable it's a little dimmer a little harder to see the Phoenix six pros $100 cheaper but you may scratch the lens then again you could just throw a screen protector on there for like five bucks and protect it and I'm sure there will be some people out there that just want to pay up for the exclusivity of having the sapphire model I also like that the backlight is a little bit more contrast the invisible anyways this is just a quick video to compare the two models the types of glass used and how that makes a difference in functionality I hope this video helped out I'm answering some of your questions if it did please make sure to give me a thumbs up and subscribe down below it really helps me out it makes me feel good inside and I'll see you on the next one [Music]", "SPfClq2rvdY": "how's everybody doing today you're

epoxies are extremely strong two-part adhesives that are great for your tough projects the formulas are made up of two parts a resin and a hardener that when combined create a heavy duty bond gorilla offers two premium epoxies including the original gorilla epoxy that creates a strong clear bond and gorilla well a heavy duty epoxy with incredible strength up to 40 250 psi gorilla epoxy is available in an easy-to-use syringe while gorilla weld is available in traditional two-part tubes both products set up quickly just follow these steps first make sure the surfaces of your project are clean dry and free from any grease or oil for maximum bond strength on smooth surfaces you may want to roughen up the surfaces with sandpaper before applying the epoxy next you'll need a tray to mix the two parts gorilla epoxy comes with a built-in tray but you can also use other disposable household items such as paper plate or the bottom of a soda can once you have a tray ready dispense the resin and hardener in equal parts for the syringe you will just need to remove the black cap and push down on the dispenser firmly and the epoxy will dispense in equal parts for the tubes use the cap to puncture of the foil seal for first use next using the wood stick provided or another mixing tool mix the two parts for at least 20 seconds until they're completely combined within three minutes of dispensing apply the adhesive to your project clamp surfaces together and leave undisturbed for 10 to 30 minutes full cure can take up to 24 hours after use wipe the tube or syringe tip clean with a dry cloth replace the cap and store in a cool dry place thanks for watching check back for more gorilla tough tips and other project ideas [Music] you [Music]", "EmshSYJYU5E": "[Music] [Applause] you

you guys see ya", "zDR8SFjOrBI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] yo yo yo what is up YouTube it's your boy bacon babe we are in the bedroom everything just got cleaned up nice and good beams of all the messy dirt I had on the ground most importantly I finally transplanted all of my plants from one gallon styrofoam cups up to three gallon containers we have the three Blue Lightning over here they will make an outstanding bounce back I'm absolutely positive I'm excited to see what they look like as they grow up pretty sure they're gonna be some really beefy monsters plants because they were pre deficient right from the bat within a week of being in those cups so they're hungry and the person that gave me the strain told me they could handle whatever I throw at them so all of these containers got about 2/3 of the way full of super soil and so there should be plenty to get things through until flour now if springs veg all the way through harvest supposedly for this super soil so we'll see how it goes we got three Gorilla Glue also in here in the tub they're not doing too bad they don't need too much nutrients they can handle a lot but they also don't need a lot which is great so I expect them to fully recover bounce back and start thriving as well and then outside here a little bit further from the leg we got the BT y ou G now these guys were really deficient lacking in basically everything but I also expect them to fully bounce back now that that's a super soil going and basically what I did is I chose I had for Gorilla Glue to choose from before the BT yov when I chose just to keep three of each one for space and two just because I really don't need that many so I chose the three three best at each one based on the structure their stem size and they're developed now so I don't expecting these guys to all bounce back fairly quickly and it's gonna be a jumbling here probably be very soon so be nice to get these out of here and get them flowering as soon as I pull the other ones out and yeah gotta get some more yellow sticky traps in here because I've got little [ __ ] like that popping up here and there so we're gonna get rid of those [ __ ] so we got a little sticky traps and we'll be good to go it's been a long day of transplanting cleaning so Cheers it's time to go relax you guys have a good night baking paper", "L-0fJlXIUbk": "hey guys it's your girl tamika your online hair care teacher back again with another hair video okay y'all i'm not sure if you've seen it but the girl who put the gorilla glue in her hair is on tick tock and it's gone viral and i just wanted to give you guys like my perspective from a professional point of view you know because i teach all about hair care and stuff like that so maybe i can even offer her a little bit of advice but if you guys haven't seen the video i'm going ahead and roll the footage as two videos i'm going to roll the fitted so you can see the video and then i'm going to tell you what i think about it after we watch it all right oh dear my heart goes out to you lady oh my heart goes out to you okay and see this type of stuff is a reason why y'all need to go ahead and sign up for some of those hair care classes i'll be offering the 14 day hair growth boot camp the sign up is going on right now i'm putting the link below y'all need to get this knowledge so you won't be doing stuff like this okay all right so from a professional perspective um i don't know i i just gotta gather my thoughts i just gotta get my thoughts because okay this is my second time seeing the video so i got a chance to really really really see it without like anybody else in the room like reaction and laughing or whatever they had to do first of all my heart goes out to you her name is tessica my heart goes out to you poor darling because i know that hair can be an emotional thing and she obviously loves her hair to be really really polished that's probably why she went about doing what she did okay and she looks really nice she got the eyelashes and she got the contacts and she got the makeup and she got the you know her hair it looks really nice she said that her hair has been like that for a month and that she washed her hair 15 times and nothing happened what in the world oh my gosh i don't even y'all i i'm my heart is literally like beating for her so fast my heart is like racing like beating for her so fast because i understand how it is when your hair is in a state that you're not happy with and you just want it better she looked like she about ready to like just break down and literally cry okay first of all the only well not the only the first solution i see is her hair has been it like that for a month and so it's really super slick that means that it hasn't grown out a lot for her to even attempt to do anything with it so in my personal professional opinion what she's gonna have to do is um let it grow out maybe about three four months and then she's gonna have to shave it off unfortunately because right now nothing can get on her scalp uh not any razors or anything like that because it's so slick to her head and she don't want to enter herself trying to do it but from what i see she's gonna have to cut her hair all the way off and start over oh my gosh okay so jessica girl my heart goes out to you sign up for one of my classes so you can learn about healthy hair care for sure i need to send her like a dm or pm or something okay another solution uh she could maybe use some acetone to try to remove the glue from her hair like if she maybe you know got a few bottles big bottles of acetone and just try to like you know little by little dissolve the glue but she obviously sprayed that glue on there like a lot like lot for it to be slick like that and for stay just for it to stay for that long she probably was like use like the whole bottle of glue girl the only solution i see is that she's gonna have to lose her hair yeah she's gonna have to lose her hair because it's like a crust it's like a big like helmet of of glue on her head that's not coming off the video she says she washed her hair 15 times she literally showed you how she put conditioner on her hair and it did not even absorb like zero period nothing so you're gonna have to maybe get some um glue solvent or some acetone or some type of remover to to get that off uh if you want to attempt to get it off but i wouldn't put myself through that because you don't want to expose yourself to all those chemicals and stuff so i would just go ahead and just wait for it to grow out and just shave it off in the meantime what you could do is you could cut that ponytail off the back of your head and just wear wigs until you know it grows out enough to cut off i don't know how how long her hair was previously but if she had a lot of hair previously then she just gonna lose all that and have to start all over before baby you poor darling okay one thing i want to address is she used gorilla glue okay so we as a community we know all about the gorilla snot gel okay and that's what we typically use you know to slick down stuff you know because it's real sticky and tacky the one in the yellow bottle um we do have a habit of calling it gorilla glue we do because we like to shorten stuff and so that's probably where the mix up in her mind came because she was probably like i got some gorilla glue thinking that the gorilla the actual gorilla glue that's actually a glue that sticks to stuff is the same as a gorilla not gel which it is not now i think that she probably didn't from what i'm seeing she probably did not go to the store because she mentioned a couple a couple of things she mentioned that she ran out of her um her got to be uh hairspray and so she and then she mentioned that she got the other stuff and used it instead so she probably already had that on hand she probably did not go to the store to get uh the gorillas the gorilla glue because if she hadn't gone to the store then she could have just picked up another container of the got to be glue it got to be um hairspray instead of getting the gorilla glue because if you go to the spot store they ain't gonna have no real glue there if you go to walmart they're gonna have the gorilla glue and the gorilla snot gel and they got to be but the gorilla glue that sticks the stuff in the gorilla snot gel and the got2b is in two totally different sections one is in the haircare section that would be the gorilla snot gel and the got to be and the other ones over there by the paint and stuff so there's no way in the world she could have gotten that mixed up so she probably had that gorilla glue on hand and decided to use it and it looks like she sprayed a lot of it on her hair and maybe she didn't use her hands maybe she used a comb to smooth it on so she couldn't feel the sticky tackiness of it but i'm gonna tell you what gorilla glue is the the stickiest stick to it is glue you could ever use and literally nothing dissolves it really except for other chemicals so my heart goes out to you girl for that mix-up i mean for sure you know i can't say you know you know what she was thinking whatever i do i do see that she likes to have her hair polished and so that was hard alternative uh that was that was that that was bad that was bad that was bad that was really really really bad and um kudos to you for being transparent and opening up and showing us what happened with you and i feel sorry for you because you're gonna get a lot of people who are laughing at you and and you know dissing you and all that type of stuff and you know she needs to be uplifted because she's going through a trying time right now whenever you lose your hair or something happens to your hair that's unsafe if you have any type of setback whatever it's detrimental it can send you down a spiral depending on you know how you do your hair so girl my heart goes out to you but i don't i just don't see how she could have got that mixed up i don't i don't know i honestly don't know yeah but my heart goes out to you but anyways this type of stuff is a very reason why i do online coaching and online hair care classes y'all get your knowledge so you won't suffer through things like this so you know how to properly care for your hair how to care for your hair the right way what

back on my feet i've always been [Music] it's justin diego back with another binge worthy video and y'all we finally got an update on gorilla glue girl and i think it's safe to say that this sticky situation has finally come to an end it's a bit of a sticky one still mostly right now anyway late wednesday evening tmz posted footage of jessica brown aka gorilla glue girl touching down in los angeles to meet dr michael obang at his practice in beverly hills where he took on the impossible task of removing all of the gorilla glue from jessica's hair and i really had my doubts no seriously y'all i really really really had my doubts but in the name of black excellence this dr obang did his thing and our girl jessica is finally unbound of this messy gorilla glue i was happy to hear that a black man was the one who came to her rescue without charging jessica brown a dime i was really afraid that so many opportunists would have their hand in this story just to take advantage of the full free promotion but this doctor definitely rose to the occasion going above and beyond to not just cut off all of her hair and leave her scalp ball and you know i feel like that would have really been the easy way out and i feel like if he wasn't a black doctor he wouldn't really got it and i just see that he took his time to actually think it through and i was really impressed that he took it upon himself to actually contact gorilla glue and we all know that they had that little stinking attitude and did not even think for a second how they could get in touch with their own chemist to see how they got this glue off their hands when they were doing them lab tests if they did them lab tests because they ain't labeling stuff right but i digress the doctor says that they return his phone call but they were not much help anyway this black king did what he was supposed to do for our black queens and he figured out some details about their ingredients to come up with his own gorilla glue hair removal not hair removal gorilla glue remover and i just cannot get enough of this black excellence and i was happy that he also confirmed that jessica managed to avoid any major sustainable injuries to her scalp and i was so glad to see the positive reactions from y'all on social media with onlookers chiming in saying exhales i was way too invested in this dot dot dot before another person cracked me up saying we did it joe and one girl responded my good sis still have some inches exclamation point and people were definitely shocked about the results saying the fact that she was able to keep any of her hair is a miracle before this uk doctor caught my eye talking about thank god for her exclamation point and hats off to the doctors for helping her keep her hair what the enemy meant for our bag in these madam cj walker streets on the month of black history my god meant for our good not that but no i am so happy that this story has finally taken a turn for the best especially since a lot of you guys were concerned about the message that all of this was sending to our already troubled tick-tocking youth and at the end of the day if this does happen again we now have a solution that was kind of created by black men see how we would just look at jessica y'all can you believe she actually salvaged her hair we love to see it and my good sis definitely found the time to get her nails done because i caught some of y'all definitely door in shade trying to play her talking now she only got three fingernails y'all are so petty and i was happy to finally get to see some of jessica's personality more when she told doctors she told them doctors that they gonna have to hurry up because she got to get her hair done in time for valentine's day which is sunday because she definitely got a day you got a date for valentine's day yeah i know period thanks so much for watching this video all the way to the end i am one of those people that was rooting for jessica brown from the very beginning and i'm happy that we can finally just enjoy this hilarious moment without having to worry about her scalp our gorilla glue girl definitely won in my opinion she is sitting verified paid and laid and i cannot wait to see what she does next she's got a point she's an icon she's a legend and she is the moment now come on now gorilla glue y'all got 72 hours to respond but no seriously i can definitely see an endorsement deal for jessica from gorilla glue and i can definitely see her being the face of whatever this glue remover is from dr obang thanks again for watching this video i will see y'all hair stylist on the next one when i do my hair i like to you know finish it off with a little got the big glue spray you know just to keep it in place well i didn't have any more got to be glue space so i use this gorilla glue spray bad bad bad idea i've washed my hair 15 times and it don't move stiff well so i'm gonna tell y'all like this if you ever run out of got

"9kMLFerCN60": "the statue of a blue gorilla who used to display his genitals in the Church of San Pierre Darwin in Nice France has been dressed riposte - Catholic fr July 22nd reports that this is a consequence of international protests against an x-rated representation in a church that is under pressure from the ongoing sexual abuse hype the blue gorilla is part of an exhibition my comment what is so unfortunate about this story as that people don't seem concerned about getting this piece of so-called artwork out of Jesus's Church it has no business in God's house", "SetqI5MhiHo": "but this guerilla bow is a highly effective tool I check it out I'm not sponsored by him I'm not paid by him I just I've been wanting one Corona made me get one and I don't regret it I'm telling you right now all this thing's sick what's up guys Jake's a loose man blue collar outdoors and today I'm going to show you one of my favorite bicep burners for the gorilla Bo there you can utilize the lightweight anywhere and really get that pump on stay tuned in New York State our gyms are still closed so that means the gorilla bo has been worth it now I have done a couple videos which are on the channel about the gorilla both some upper body some overview some benching and stuff like that but one thing that's always asked about is biceps or biceps triceps how do you get big arms now this video is one of my favorite methods I do this in the gym also thanks to coronavirus we're not able to get in the gym right now so this is getting the job done for me now that method is after I'm done with my biceps I refer to it as death I'll go over to the dumbbells I'll get start at 5 pounds go up to 10 then 15 then 20 then 25 and 30 35 40 45 you get the deal till you literally can't add a weight and then as soon as you hit that way and you fail you you turn around stand that way get what you can it's got to be even if you get to on your right you got to get to on your left so you keep it even all the way down and then you'll you'll set like I aim for 10 going up each weight and then 5 going down each weight and really emphasize your form now with the gorilla bow this right here is the 50 pound band on here I like doing these really light so you can really focus on the actual movement it's raining out so we can't get out in the lawn I'm gonna try my best to really explain this to you guys and show you all the points but bear with me I am self filming so here we go now this is what I call death it's my version with the gorilla bow now let me step back so the first grip will be in Center of the gorilla bow and we're gonna do 10 reps now the form this stays the same throughout the whole thing so see my arm it's pushed into my side right here pushed in tight so you can't get out and you start using your shoulders let's really focus on your biceps that's why we go light so drive that right into your side kind of have your elbow out a little bit so you're about right here and then when you're coming up with the gorilla bow rotate your wrist upward kind of kind of like you're going to eat so let me just show you real quick get something like that get your arms ready and then push what you really want to focus on is that last bit bringing that hand up because what you're doing is you're getting that full contraction we went over hands now feet alright as you can tell I'm barefoot today so the first first set this is how I'm gonna have my feet dead close together and then for set to I'll go with a shoulder-width apart stance just like this let me get centered here so it makes it a lot more resistance on those bands so set one feet together set two shoulder-width apart really push those biceps so this is how my feet are gonna be throughout row grip like that then it's just your main focus isn't going all the way up we got you saw the feet set one which will be 10 okay so set 1 with your feet dead together we're gonna start here and get 10 then hand out hand out 10 hand out hand out 10 and I go until I get out here till I get all the way up here and then really focus on those and when you get in you're wides kind of bring your arms in tighter lock them right on your lats and keep your shoulders back so when you pull up you're getting as much out of your bicep as you can you're gonna get some shoulder power in there it's it just happens but if you really drive your arm into your side get your elbow kind out in front of you and pick up and pull and keep your shoulders back your really getting the most out of these workouts I promise you so keep that shoulder back arm tight elbow out a little bit and let's get it but here we go my turn the beach towel and I'll just fast-forward through all this here we go let's build some biceps there's that one like I said ten each feet dead together ten each like this and then just go out of hand all the way out and really once you get wide kind of jam it into your lap this death workout as I call it is a great way to kill your biceps but I'm not giving them a break it's time to widen the feet really get the load so on the second set I start out wide so it's just flipped and then I'll go for eight reps because it's gonna be more weight so I'm just trying to really focus go slow and dry push that blood into that muscle bringing your nutrition from your diet push it right into muscle make it grow so really focus on the slow mind muscle connection on your second set so without further ado let's get after it whoa all right as you can tell I'm out of breath now depending on how far you go out you can really load it up with the gorilla bowl I've been experimenting with a bunch of different angles and all that now with the gorilla bow when I first started working out with it one thing I notice is doing biceps doing this exact same workout until I figured out kicked shoulders as far back as you can you almost like lock them in and then get right here now I like to do that I would see that as one set I like to do it for three sets total and go lightweight with it because it pushes a lot of blood in your in your biceps which is how you grow the more blood you can push in your biceps the more nutrition is going to them guys I'm telling you the pump is huge you do not need a lot of weights with biceps to really grow good biceps alright guys wherever you are and your fitness goals this workout will help you now the key to it is toning down that weight which is something that I had a hard time doing when I first started out lifts and I always try to go too heavy with biceps and I tell you right now my biceps in grow that's just plain and simple everything else grew good biceps couldn't grow could not get arms until I really focused on my mind muscle connection really focusing on the contraction toning down the weights and really really truly hitting my biceps now this workout right here will help you if you have a gorilla bow test it out drop a comment below let me know if you do something like this I guarantee someone does it's not really that hard it's just changing your grips hitting different parts here your heads and it's really effective at building your biceps just build that mind-muscle connection and let's grow now I said I've only put a couple workout videos with the gorilla boa on the channel if you guys want to see more of this kind of content drop a comment below let me know I would be glad to do it because this is really Bo's been getting me through as you know we still can't lift here in New York in a gym so we're outside luckily us in the

[Music] hey everybody this is tjr and welcome to the first installment of music worth buying classic for the next four weeks we're going to be replaying the original first four episodes of music worth buying these were originally broadcast on youtube over 10 years ago on a channel that belonged to robert and myself called oddly enough music worth buying sadly that channel is now defunct we lost it many years ago and what was the story behind that well it's a long story and maybe someday we'll talk about it in a future video thankfully though the music worth buying series has continued on this channel although it has been for about a year now been on temporary hiatus initially robert had some personal matters he had to deal with and then of course came the pandemic we're hoping that after this pandemic ends robert and i can get back to doing regular episodes of music worth buying so first i want to just give a little history lesson regarding the origins of music worth buying the idea for the show came about many many years ago i was having a conversation with robert and i brought up the uh movie review series at the movies that starred siskel and ebert and i said to him you know there needs to be a show like that where two music fans get together and they discuss albums in the same way that they discussed movies on that show and robert just looked at me and he said okay let's do it and i said are you serious and he said yeah let's do it so we did and we have been doing it now for over 10 years now the original series and the episodes you're about to watch were originally broadcast on a channel that is now defunct that channel was called music worth buying as far as the reason why that channel no longer exists well it's a long story and i'm not sure it's one that either of us want to get into right now but maybe at some future date we'll talk about it the series has continued on this channel although about a year ago roughly it went on a hiatus robert had some personal family issues that he had to deal with and then of course the pandemic happened and we're really both hoping that once this pandemic is over we can both return to doing this series again so now let's take a look at the very first episode we ever did in this episode i discuss the first album by band of skulls entitled baby darling doll face honey and robert discusses the album american jungle by bright blue gorilla this episode was originally broadcast back in 2009 and looking back at it the first thing that hits me is just how matter-of-fact and to the point we were we just basically got in and we got out we didn't do a whole lot of commentary unlike our later videos where we sometimes went on for about 15 to 20 minutes the other thing i noticed is just how much younger we both looked leyvay hi this is tjr professional musician and my name is robert kinsler i'm a music writer and you're watching musicworthbind.com our album our first album for this week is going to be the band of skulls baby darling doll face honey now i discovered this album uh through the sale ads on best buy uh one of my favorite places to discover albums and when i first saw the title of the band i thought this was going to be a heavy metal band this is a heavy band but they probably owe a lot more to blues heavy blues rock bands in the 70s like cream and led zeppelin to give you an idea let's check out the very first track it's in titled uh light of the morning oh no we got attacked by copyright gremlins you'll just have to trust us it was an awesome awesome track sounds good very very you can hear that led zeppelin vibe going on in that especially with that particular song now let me show you the packaging of this one this is uh becoming i love these kind of these kind of mini vinyl gatefold type of sleeves uh what i love even more about this particular album is the way that the cd is actually combined into the artwork hopefully you can see this okay as i pull this up and take a look see how that works and then you put it back in there we go it also comes with a very nice lyrics booklet too always good to have those uh kudos to them on some excellent packaging on this album it even comes with a little card uh which lets you download a free ringtone wow uh for your phone it's also a very cool thing uh now one great thing about this band is their versatility while they are heavy they have more than just one color to them so we're going to listen to the next song which is called honest and it features uh the female bass player of the band doing lead vocals there's more than one split singer in this band let's check it out you gotta be honest [Laughter] right on the inside very nice yeah so as you can see it's it's pretty much like um it's almost a different band when they have the uh the additional lead singer and um just like led zeppelin could do rock and roll on their first song like good times bad times on their first album and then have babe i'm going to leave you this is a band that says you know we're a heavy band but we're not limited to just one sound or one color and so that's my pick of the week it's certainly worth music it's certainly music worth buying thank you band of skulls for making music with mine what's your pick today uh my pick is actually a group named bright blue gorilla it's actually a duo it's a husband and wife they've been together since the early 90s but they're relatively unknown other than among their you know their their cultish following that they have here in europe um and kind of what's interesting about them is that they really defy easy description um they both they both sing they both play a multiple of instruments but what's kind of interesting is i call them like eclectic folk or something there is amplification in their music at times but really what's kind of interesting is how they incorporate a lot of acoustic sounds not not really piano but like uh guitars um i guess you can expect instruments yeah like like tambourines but even things that they've they've traveled throughout the world and they've picked up a lot of unusual acoustic instruments in india and throughout europe and they incorporate a lot of those sounds and they also incorporate them so that they're very musical um i think what we're going to do first is hear um hear one song to give you an idea of kind of their sound and uh this first song is called um hold me [Music] [Music] and that that again that song is called hold me and that's uh robin rosencrantz on lead vocals and her husband's name who's also in the group his name is michael glover they both pretty much share vocals and and they're they're terrific at uh it vocal harmonies too and their voices really blend together magically kind of interesting i mean we were talking about packaging with the group that you featured this week this is their official cd release and it came out actually more than 10 years ago but i wanted to still bring it to the floor today because you can get it on amazon.com and and through the band's website music never goes out of style no it definitely doesn't they don't sound dated this is a very nice uh package it has all the lyrics it has some photos of them together and um you know and it kind of ties in their bright blue grill and you see bananas all over the place and that kind of fits so you show that too there as well exactly and it has like the whole little artwork like that it really does yeah and it's and it's really uh colorful but the the the funny backstory of this is originally when it came out before they had the money to actually issue the proper cd they issued it in a baggie and it was sales uh contents bright blue gorilla do not freeze so it's kind of funny so for those that are really big fans of that's a rarity then yeah oh yeah so you can you can buy the regular cd but then if you really like it twice as much you can go out and find the original bag you release and i thought i'd share that today with the video yeah yeah let's do it now we're going to hear a song called feel the movement stop when you hold back [Music] [Music] and that's a and that's like i said get a good idea there a little bit of of kind of how their voices blend and it's it's interesting what we uh how much the term folk has changed over the last 20 30 years folk in a lot of people's mind is still someone sitting there with an acoustic guitar singing very whiny annoying songs and now folk is has concluded electronic instruments it can be very uh americana sounding it's it's really got a broad definition now it definitely does and they kind of like i said they they kind of take folk music that traditional you know style that you're talking about and really bend it on and see here especially incorporating world music into what they do so definitely definitely uh you introduced me to somebody good and i hopefully introduced you yes you did i'm gonna be checking them out and uh thanks so much for watching that concludes this episode of music worth buying be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel for all the reviews and for all our writings be sure

here with grayscale gorilla in today's quick start i'm going to show you guys how we can get the most out of our new car paint materials for octane so if you haven't already downloaded them from the grayscale gorilla hub go ahead and do that and they will automatically appear here in the plus library so you can see here we got car panes for arnold octane and redshift but in this case we're going to check out the octane versions i'm going to go ahead and drag this into my ui here now it's really important that you're in the latest version of octane in my case it is 2020.2 dash r3 and we just want to make sure that we have osl support for our new procedurally based flakes so if i go ahead and grab this blueprint blue throw it onto my body here which i've kind of isolated out and by the way this wonderful corvette model can be downloaded from cgtrader if you want to follow along but yeah i'm going to fire up the live viewer here and we will see what we get out of the box and yeah just like that you can see we have a lovely looking car paint this crazy green is a favorite and happens to look really great on this corvette and so if i dive into this close-up camera i've set up here we can see that we got all kinds of flakes going on here and if i open up a node editor let me drag this also into my ui i can dive in here and start to see how this is set up but one of the great things is with our custom flake shader you can get in here and dial in the flakes to your liking now if you have brought in a car model and the flakes are all out of whack or maybe the scale is crazy like i just changed here that probably means your car model is actually not set up at the correct scale so by default all of our car paints are set up at the correct scale for a car model that is also set up at the correct scale but you can always get in here and start playing around with these settings to dial them in to your liking so if i put the scale to a value of like two that looks pretty good for getting a closer look at these we've also given you the control for density so if i crank this up to 0.9 for example now we have a whole heck of a lot of flakes and then we have this randomized parameter which controls sort of the virtual rotation of the flakes if you think about it like that if i bring it down to 0.1 you can see they're much smoother and flatter looking but probably a value of around 0.35 is good and a density value of 0.4 and then the scale back to something like .25 is a lot more realistic so if i hop out to this camera you can see where we're at here and of course we can always get in here and change the colors so if i want to get into my base coat here i can start tweaking the colors let's maybe make a blue car paint and then we want to change the colors for the specular layer so let's try here tweaking that to blue that's looking pretty cool and of course the flakes themselves have color so let me hop into here and set these to kind of a bluish color as well you can see there's a lot of different colors that make up these car paints fairly complex if you consider all the different layers that make up a car paint and yeah this looks really cool actually maybe we should save this one out but yeah guys so that's just a few of these car paints we also have this green camo which turned out really cool it's like a camo wrap the snow camo wrap also a favorite but yeah they're a ton of fun to play with we really can't wait to see what everyone creates with these super excited to get them out to everybody thanks so much for checking out this video and we will see you in another one very soon", "U-jCBTneGh8": "[Music] how you do it this game is so dark dreamy you're in micro bring me your headset yeah all right I'll give it to you for free

head bro hold on let me let me get in there with y'all real quick because this like this is the first time i'm seeing it right along with y'all so cause like soon as i zipped up the tent i mean as soon as i opened the tent and zipped it down i was like oh [ __ ] look at that oh look at them sunflowers look at them sunflower seeds forming wow and this one is the next one to try to do this thing because this one this one was in well that one was in these uh their stages so it's kind of like it goes from that one all open to this one closing up to this one opening back up into a sunflower head so it goes from this to this and finally that beautiful young lady back there let me touch these real quick like whoa that's amazing just came out of nowhere bro it was not like this 48 hours ago and my georgia southern collard green looking just fine all right y'all about the water and be done you alright peace all right y'all so i just harvested these uh two bottom leaves for my collard green and they look good i think i caught them just in time because they're they were just starting to start to feel rubbery and like soft that's how you know it's the leave is starting to get older and about to die off in a minute but this one is just right bro i'm about to eat this and this one and i don't know how much longer i'm going to grow this collard green out because it's growing slow compared to the kale like compared to the kale i probably would have had like five or six mini harvest by now i think this is like the second one right here the second harvest i don't got off of this collard green so we'll see just got done watering and now about the top spray them down nice you what up y'all it's monday october 26th and look at my sunflower bruh look at it look at that just like i had oh man magnificent this one's coming along as well as that one she kind of shy so she turned her back on us but just look at it wow all right so i just wanted to show y'all where the last of us part 2 came from so this is the last of us part one that i had it came with a bundle pack when i first got my ps3 and it came with this and another game but man this is like one of my favorite games of all time so this is ellie as a kid that's what i kept saying as a kid and as a teenager so playing here you play with her as a kid and then here i guess she's a teenager so that's her as a kid and her as a teenager crazy and that's joel right there that's the one that looked after her but i don't know what happened to him in this one because i don't even see him i don't see him nowhere but he's the main character that you play with and she's like a tag along but on this one i guess she's the main character and i don't know who the tagalong is on this one i guess there is no tag along but um this game is basically about like end of the world you know i'm saying apocalyptic um having a scavenge for food for ammo for anything really it's so tight in this game because they don't give you unlimited ammo like they'll literally give you like five rounds of ammo and then you gotta just go search for more hey yo [Music] that's ty what up youtube so it's tuesday october 27 2020 in our grow and man man man we officially made it to week number four flower you know what i'm saying ladies loving it everything looking good except for the lime green leaves but we could work with that i'm saying long as the buds fatten up the leaves don't even matter what i'm saying so we're in day number 22 flower which is the first day of week four for the photo period plants for my autos um i didn't add up my days right for my autos so i was telling y'all that my autos were always two weeks ahead well actually they're three weeks ahead you know i'm saying i wasn't doing my calculations right so my autos are in day 42 a flower photo periods and day 20 to a flower so my autos are in week number six day six so tomorrow will be officially uh week seven for my autos now for my pineapple express female number this is final number one for my pineapple express phenol number two which is intent to i'm gonna let that one go for about another week but this one looks like she needs to go now so um let me see i'm not gonna put her under 24 hours darkness instead i'ma just um because it's just spurred a moment so with just this one plant i'ma harvest it uh before i go to work today so i'm gonna give it about uh 10 hours of darkness after the light shut off today so i'm gonna just give you 10 hours instead of my usual 48 hours darkness i'm gonna just give it 10 hours oh well at least i got something to smoke on until these girls are ready because i'm down to my last uh blueberry uh herme blueberry from like a couple girls ago i'm saying that i've been smoking on and that's all i got left i'm saying i didn't smoked up all my last season's harvest and everything else is smoked up so we need some medicine and that's where this will come into play so without further ado let's get into these ladies right here all right so like i said um day 22 for the photo periods uh my sunflowers are in day 51 and that [ __ ] gonna blow your mind how mature they look all right so let's just get into some of these so we're gonna start off with the pineapple express auto right here final number one she's getting so chunky on me is ridiculous oh my gosh and she stinks and again this is from barney's farm is my flash on okay they can show my is on this is a barney's farm see right here hold on let me just get my angles right real quick y'all know how i like to get my angles get my curt angles because it's just not how i want to show y'all all right there you go i think that's about it right um and i tried to pollinate one of these one of these buds i think it was uh this one down here i used uh some old a little bit of old pollen from my hermit blueberry which had a couple pollen sacks that i just rubbed against my fingers and touched these but that was like a couple that was like a few weeks ago and it was this bud right here so hopefully it got seed on it if not oh well i need medicine and i need it now so there we go that's the angles i was looking for right there that's what i was looking for oh yeah she ready steady already here what's going on one more shot of the pineapple and then we'll move on matter of fact this gonna be the last shot of the pineapple because she's getting harvested tonight so everybody get your last look at this uh pineapple express fino one from barney's farms let's get that last snug down there and again it's been chilly the past couple days in vegas so if y'all hear me sniffling that's what it's because of nothing else all right so let's move on to our blue gorilla fino one getting chunky on a [ __ ] like look at this one they got two heads on she needs a comb cause she getting hairy on your brother from another i don't know if i'm gonna get on dying light i mean i don't know if i'm gonna get on the last of us today because i really want to save that game for my off day i don't want to start playing this game during a work day so i might just save this game for this weekend or something because i want to really enjoy it and i might even uh re-up with the connect i don't know i haven't read up with the connect in so long what is going on hold on hold on real quick yo all right there we go i haven't read up with a connect in so long because i am the connect look at this i am the connect but i might get a little bit of medicine from the connect who knows the connect might not even know my name like damn when the last time you hit me up brother you know what i'm saying good shout out it's funny because sometimes i'll tell the connects i'll tell my connects that i grow weave that i'm a grower and i just need some temporary uh medication until my medication matures and they'd be like oh yeah yeah yeah whatever like you know i'm saying talking to you like like you lying or something it's crazy we're not really like brushing you off like yeah yeah whatever but definitely like not hearing what you saying because i know if i was to connect and somebody told me they grew weed and they just needed a temporary fix until their medication was complete i would be like bruh don't even worry about payment here this is on the house just make sure you look out for me when this is done but everybody doesn't have the same mindset and mentality as me so it is what it is all right let's move on uh blue gorilla final number two i'm saying so all this hold up all this is fino one and this is pheno2 so let's get into it a jungle welcome to the jungle the jungle that's the noise they was making i don't know why they made that noise all right that's vino number two we got some baby nugs going on back here all right so pheno1 pheno2 pheno3 and this is pheno four so we're gonna get to pheno3 right now you know three and i think i think i'm finally starting to then we'll get to pheno4 in a second but i think i'm finally starting to dial in into how i'm gonna feed my plants so from now on i'm not gonna top dress the soil anymore because i notice when you top dress the soil with heavy fertilizer or just with fertilizer period it burns the leaves because from what i noticed and what i've uh from my hypothesis that i came up with is that you pour your fertilizer in your compost you give it time to break down with the uh microbes the let the microbes break it down don't pour it in your soil because if you pour it in the soil it's not going to give the microbes time to break down the fertilizer the nutrients therefore it's kind of like pouring salt on an open wound it's just going to burn i'm saying just like how my plants last time were burning as you can see you don't see no burnt tips because i learned now that i pour all my fertilizer in my compost let it break down in the compost give it about a week to two weeks minimum of one week to give it time to break down i'll usually try to give it a week and a half to two weeks to fully break down once it's broken down then you grab some of that compost about two to three cups worth and that's how you top dress each plant you don't top dress it with fertilizer you top dress your plants with compost that's enriched with fertilizer broken down fertilizer i hope i made sense when i was trying to explain it to y'all if not it's so much that i've been researching it's so hard to explain that you'll just see it in the end result and with that being said let's go back here to blue guerrilla final four hold on i'm gonna open this side up so we can get over there and then we'll get to these matter of fact we'll save that one for last let's just get this while we're on this side um oh shout out to nike [Music] so this is our nyc diesel final one right here this was what i use for my thumbnail for last week's video and look how much she's matured since that thumbnail from last week i might even thumbnail this one too now i'm a thumbnail my pineapple just because she's about to go so she deserves to have a last thumbnail all right let's get into this nyc diesel fino number one and i know she's gonna smoke bro because when i rub on her stem oh smells gas way more gassy than the sour diesel all right so let's get into here and see from the bottom she's getting there all right let's move on to the hairy lemon back there let's finish off the nyc diesel and then we'll move on to the hairy lemon straight white all right harry lemon let me see if she has a lemony scent to her by now let me rub that stem find out oh she do got a lemony zest if i do because i think i got a clone of this but i don't know if it survived or not but if it does survive and i see that clone i might name it lemon heads or some [ __ ] something has to do with lemons squat all right and finally let's get to blue gorilla fino number four right here look at all these nugs bruh all right i'm gonna just give you a sky view of everything now now that we've seen everything sky view oh let's get the cactuses first i haven't got the cactuses in a minute that's my white one and that's the red one coming along looking good loving life now let's get a sky view i don't know so and there it is tent number one down and let's move on to tent number two all right y'all we intent number two um the youngest one believe it or not that's in this tent is our blair witch which is four days younger than the rest of the photo periods so we're gonna start off with this pineapple express auto right here now this is what i was talking about when i said uh fino one they're both almost well tomorrow will be a week seven form but this one looks like it could go about another week or so even though she's getting nice and fat on me even though she getting chunky look at that i could damn near wrap my whole hand around that nug right there i noticed snug right here just this one nug right here just this one nug right here is gonna be eyeball eyeball about a quarter about a quarter ounce about seven grams just this one nut if i let it stretch about another week and then all these down here look like a whole bunch of eighths like eight eight eight eight if i let it go another week that's exactly what it'll be so let me really just get down here with it real quick here we go pineapple express phenol number two uh why can't i get a good shot oh let me see trying to figure out which way it would be best to shoot let me see if i do it right here all right all right pineapple express fino number two right here there we go getting rock hard chunky let's get into some of these so oh yeah oh yeah i didn't water them today because i've been watering them every day so i want to really just give them a break and give those roots time to dry up because believe it or not if you let your if you water your plants every day and you just give them that one day to dry up and it just suck up all that additional moisture then it makes the nugs more more fat i'm saying because it's able to the roots are able to suck up more nutrients i'm saying when you let that soil dry not fully dry but at least you know enough where the nugs get rock hard all right so this one right here is our blue gorilla final number seven then we'll move on to our unknown aka blair witch so this is our blue gorilla pheno7 again before you get into it as y'all can see this room is way more green than tent one and that has to do with the light intensity and i have a grow light on its way shout out to my future partners with the grow light that's coming so just look out for that video let me get up real quick so we could see the blue gorillas and all their glory these plants look so much more healthier since they're not under all that intensity of light that's another reason why we got to get rid of this 4000 watt led it's just not fit for a four by four tent if i had like a five by five maybe but this four by four is just not cutting it so all this right here is blue gorilla final seven let's just get one top shot and we'll move on all right let's move on to blair witch again i named her blair witch because she's growing so big and like a stick even though she is the youngest one she's growing the biggest out of all of them and i did get the clone and hopefully the clone survives i don't know what this is i don't know what fino it is but now it's blair witch speaking of blair witch i will be getting the blair witch game on black friday because i know the price will go down really i should have got dying like two on black friday but i just couldn't wait it's just some games you just can't wait on and that's one of them [Music] blair witch then got so big she's uh then reached where all the electrical cords and [ __ ] you shouldn't even be up here girl but you up here you dunking like a will chamberlain or something and i measured her last week and she is three and a half feet tall so she's damn near the size of a short [ __ ] let me get on this side so we can see it more attempts looking good again let's use this let me check my time lights go off at nine i have to hurry up this is blair witch from the back from the back and this is the other hopefully she just gives me two long colas that connect getting hella frosty hella frosty this is marvel right here and that's more of her down here all right so blair witch let's move on to nyc diesel final number two omg bro this is probably the most productive plant one of the most productive plants i have in my whole grow look at this this is like a professional plant right here boy hold on this one deserves its own [ __ ] its own tent or something bro like look at this praying to the stars yeah and this one right here is our blue gorilla fino number six right here this is fino six doing marvelous all right and i just want to move on to the candy kush finally the candy kush boy that's more fino six blue gorilla and the candy kush wowzers gotta get a good shot of her growing out of a two gallon pot mind you all right that's candy kush all right so that's tent number two and let's move on to our veg all right y'all in the grand finale the vegetable tent oh [Music] how did this how is this growing inside an indoor garden how is that even possible oh my gosh i think sunflowers are gonna be my second favorite thing to grow besides we i mean it's just so beautiful and so easy to grow bro all right so let's look at this one look at all them leaves about ready to burst open this one is shy so let me turn her i'm saying looking lovely since she's so shy we'll put it right back where she was but let's get the main event right here hold on let me get the light right let me get the light right let me get the light right wow if this was outside it'll be so many bees trying to pollinate this right now i just want to feel it real quick oh it just feels so healthy me make sure okay got enough water in there let me see the back of it real quick that's the back and that's the front hello this is where all the seeds will start magnificent and there's our georgia southern collard green now as far as my new

blue so once you do that you want to look over to your keyboard and you basically can find the numbers you can go from uh one to zero or like one to nine and then others also zero at the end because it's like a keyboard so yeah you can do that and then on the very right side you can see three options so basically uh for red is option one for blue is option two and for green is option three now on

podcast where zach is drinking marijuana and and uh oh i spilt and we like to take your boredom away so make sure to smash that subscribe button down below guys hit the like and bell so you get notified whenever we post a brand new podcast episode and man today is a very weird pod cast man do we got a lot to talk about so there's a debate going around i have a debate going around well i've heard it before but what are your what are your thoughts on twinkies they hit like the normal flavored twinkies not like the oreo flavor because those are fake twinkies fur although their crust is good whatever you call it that's that that stuff okay what do you um what is the best part of an of a twinkie in your opinion the cream filling the cream really so you like the cream just stop saying it like that dog oh no like the cream oh yeah guys i picked up some brand new apple headphones these were like i found them in the like they're brand new they're apple certified too they're apple certified too sorry henry and they're made by razer as well they teamed up with two different brands um yeah two different brands henry and yeah these are brand new apple headphones they're called the apple pod max pros and playing you just slapped an apple sticker on a twenty dollar gaming headset no i didn't and i okay my brother gave this to me i have no clue how much this was so what we're gonna do wha what what explain what are you talking about the best part of a twinkie what's the cream let's continue in my opinion it's not the cream i was never a big cream guy that's what she said and um i i have always just the breading what what is it called the breading the bread is it bread yeah because i couldn't tell if it's bread or not because i've never seen bread that soft before this guy is so stupid okay you really got back up huh you want to say something get the camera assistant get the camera oh my god i think the blueprint podcast is so great and you subscribe [ __ ] tyler tyler sucks what'd you say it's fake youtube it's fake my hands are up my hands are up my hands are up his hands are fake listen you're gonna [ __ ] go away or else i will oh you want the smoke he wants the smoke yeah guys i'm sorry for all this cussing zach is from something that happened you know i clapped him in gta multiple times and he did just recently come out of the closet um i this isn't this isn't a joke at all he came out of the closet yesterday and it took a few minutes for him to like speak it but he's like he's like um i'm actually gay and he said he's dated multiple people before so our secret twinkies what we need to discuss twinkies oh my good hat sorry here's being an [ __ ] yeah um but twinkies like twinkies so you like the cream filling dude stop saying it what the cream filling i like the bread you like the cream filling what else do you call the cream filling white stuff in the middle that sounds more weird that sounds even more weird just get to the point just get to the point just get to the point just get something but no get to the point do we call it cream filling whipped cream it's not whipped cream though is it is it whipped cream sure it is just get some white okay uh cottage cheese so um the freak okay sorry twinkies do you think twinkies expired they have an expiration date but i don't think they expire well because i just had a box of twinkies listen how can you show the audience how much it expired it is uh i ate it okay well everything obvious everything obviously gets expired um water don't the water if you think about it actually does because basically not all this in a bottle the whole time back no all the bacteria builds up on top of it it tastes like [ __ ] so basically i don't think the rappers have all right listen bread gets stale listen bread gets stale to where it gets harder um i wouldn't necessarily say it gets expired but i don't i don't think it gets expired it definitely everything that obviously does get expired but i don't think it's much of a difference like expired gummy bears that doesn't make a difference gummy worms you know whatever happens marshmallows um anyways tyler i got a question for you yeah so you know how there's holes in cheese right depends which cheese a block of cheese right in the morning yeah like the cardstock and cheese yeah and the more cheese you get the more holes you get right right she said yeah just okay yeah so by getting more and when you have holes you have less cheese right so by getting more cheese means you have less cheese i don't just think of it just think i am thinking of it see but you're getting multiple cheese slices no it's a block of cheese well yeah we who who's just going to eat a block of cheese and go oh people from wisconsin i've never been there all right so tyler let's actually get to the main point of this podcast there's one last thing why stop yelling no i'm angry i told them why not not not the not everything not everything i i kept some things private between us but roly-polies ants okay so roly-polies ants worms black widows and rain have all disappeared it's the [ __ ] winter [ __ ] they've

a trend between us but make sure to smash that subscribe button if you have not yet now what i actually wanted to say was a drama there's there's a lot of drama going around right now so if you guys don't know recently we're going to ask zach to unmute because i have no idea why this person has muted his song there we go and i am going to share my screen and i'm gonna search up and i'm gonna search woman gorilla glued her hair what what the heck she gained 530 000 followers in one instagram wait what's her instagram what's her instagram i don't know louisiana woman who use gorilla glue as hairspray has gained hundreds of thousands of followers on instagram after going viral on social media uh pes tesica brown toseka brown how do you support him i don't know to seek that's on screen um but this one believe it i can't find her account jessica i couldn't find it okay did she so she said all right look stop so she bad bad idea y'all look at my hair it didn't even but this woman was stupid enough right so what i've been hearing is yeah there's a tmz brown reported oh here it is uh tmz bra tmz reported brown head left brown left unable huntable unable oh my god this kid is so stupid my eyesight's a bit blurry and unable to wash out the glue so here right here bad bad idea y'all look my hair it it don't move you hear what i'm telling you i don't move i have washed my hair 15 times and it don't move she said upload dyslexic why would i be dyslexic i'm reading what she said times and it don't move i'm reading what she said she said in one upload before sharing a second clip showing a failed attempt using shampoo so she thought it was shampoo but my question is how do you how do you mistake shampoo for gorilla glue they rhyme they rhyme but if you're grabbing shampoo aren't you going to be opening your eyes like do you see oh a big oh like let's use this heart a gorilla that's perfect gorilla glue just put it in my hair um days she's gone viral like insanely viral i want to know what her instagram is okay so according to analytics service social blade brown has gained over 530 000 followers on instagram since february 4th that's when it logged that she had 35 35 000 followers on the app it's her i found fan pages the instagram account was displayed over jeez i found her i found her from tiktok her original upload has been viewed 18.9 million times don i found her she's like i feel absolutely awful for this person she made the decision to use gorilla glue spray in her hair instead of hairspray because she was out thinking maybe it would last just a little bit longer and she'd still be able to wash it out a gorilla look at her hair she look like a sims character she look she she like she like orbeez oh wait where'd henry go she's trying to look at her hair look look at that look at that look at that wait there's a video on it this is her instagram wait what's her instagram called it's uh i underscore d underscore o ll8 old lady wait i i'm underscore d underscore old lady not gorilla glue my hair has been like this for about a month now it's not my choice no dog she's getting so much support she was the one that put through yellow glue in her hair look how wide her eyes are though why are why are her eyes so wide no wait no wait don't hate i feel absolutely awful yep she went to emergency services tried to get all that stuff removed she made a montage okay okay so my question is is how do you mix that shampoo bottle shampoo bottle she showed with a bright orange bottle that says gorilla spray zach is it the same video twice how do you do that zach so my question is is how do you mistake a tan shampoo bottle right with a bright orange bottle with king kong on the front of it that says gorilla gorilla spray adhesive oh so she's gonna be like oh gorilla spray adhesive her newest post pray pray fly hands hands hands hey y'all any concerned about when this is has she gone to a barber i am like so confused on what is going on like how she how she like how she figured out and managed to put gorilla glue in her damn hair well it's not even gorilla gr glue it's adhesive people are stupid you can tell look at her eyes why are they so wide apart you can tell she's frightened for her life why don't you put gorilla glue in your hair just imagine if she put it going all the way down her hair oh she'd have a whip she'd be going like this no she it wouldn't even move it'd be a baseball bat you have to go it'd be crap it'd be like an avatar's wig what if she like if it's like over here in a goat you're sitting you're sitting on the back of a plane all you hear is oh honestly all you would really have to do is like shave her head to be honest i don't think you can i literally think it's too flattened to the point where razer can even get under there that's going to take months to get off she must have put a lot of it on bruh she has fan art of it how does she have that many followers and oh oh that's when she started to get popular i was looking one her fan art or whatever says 61 likes i go 24 000. four million 55 if only we were like that gorilla glue in my hair for 711 000 followers oh i'm not that stupid i mean you are kind of stupid hey i'm the old lady well she clearly honestly how how do you manage to put [ __ ] gorilla glue in your hair can you explain to me how i have not the slightest people people nowadays are so [ __ ] i'm not trying to be a dick but how do you how do you mistaken gorilla glue or shampoo for a bright orange bottle of gorilla glue with king kong's beautiful sexy face in the on the front speaking of king kong yeah let's break down this trailer so look it up there is a bunch of stuff going on about this exactly this is your heart right now indestructible wait did you actually tell them why i was angry say it in a way tell me what you said tell me what you said you said it was telling me what you told me it was a compliment what did you say what did you say then we're just not here not to see tell me or i'm leaving the meeting what'd you say are you sure yeah just tell me what you said i said you were mad because your dog wanted to do it with you that is not why i was mad no no no no i might need to tell the full story now so why i'm angry and why i'm beating up frederick where'd frederick go come here frederick i'm sorry for beating you up buddy but basically what's wrong with federer frederick or what's wrong is can you hear me you muted yourself all right guys head ass anyways i got mad tyler sorry sorry i was telling them something no so basically what happened is this girl that i really really don't like you know the girls that in in school tyler that are like dramatic for no reason uh the cheeto girls i wouldn't necessarily call them cheeto girls no sorry the girls with the cat ears yeah that's that's who she is she liked me i'm like look i'm sorry i don't like you we stay friends and i upset her so much to where i put her in a mental hospital and now she's coming back to school to hang out with us and i told her i i i imagine putting someone in a mental hospital zach you there yeah i'm here we're going on a search party guys i think zack i'm here dang your hands are oily i'm just kidding but that that's the reason you guys that's the reason all right come on so the second trailer came out during the super bowl it's the japanese one so let me actually this isn't the one how you spell it imagine if my like mic was like right here imagine i'd be fine hey it's okay henry you can chill you want to watch this here you keep them company so just watch can't hear anything but okay then i'll turn mine off too it's laggy but okay this is king kong as you guys don't know if you guys that's the girl that can communicate with king kong so this is king kong as all of you know and the there's a few ways they can take him off a skull island um but they chose the hardest way unless the in the movie they change it up but there there's a lot of stuff going on right here um i'm surprised king kong isn't breaking these chains because in kong skull island he broke away bigger chain than that like that that's what doesn't that's what confuses me like how can he not break these chains but he can like knock down a building on the lead oh yeah for sure for sure for sure for sure and right here is the little girl that can communicate with kong so back in the old king kong i don't remember when it came out there is uh the little white girl who could communicate with uh kong barely not so much but see why can't she be black that's just racing no i'm kidding i'm i'm kidding i'm kidding so kidding she can communicate with kong as far as we know and by communicating not like control but she can like sense what king kong is saying and she can do it she's psychotic for kong that's that's the best way i can put it she she hears kong's voice and so this is the japanese trailer i can't get rid of that that was in the super bowl it wasn't in the super bowl by the way it was in the ad thingies in the beginning it wasn't it wasn't by the way because i watched every last minute super bowl wasn't there this was in it no every single minute of the super bowl i watched even the commercials so it wasn't here by the way so get um this is kong's finger against the little girl meaning look how small king kong is that's not that big like she's the size of his fingernail almost she is clearly all right come on so let's keep watching keep watching so they're touching themselves not not cut cut cut that sounded wrong guys um whoa i just noticed that phone is unplugged like that's that's the original necklace from the king kong movie back in like 1980-something that's cool so [Music] and then right here this is godzilla am i supposed to all right and then my boys so that was godzilla he's mad why is godzilla mad mechagodzilla and they're putting two kings in one territory because they had a war they didn't finish it so boom godzilla comes out of the water you forgot to show the part where and boom i haven't skipped through any of it boom king kong hits him keep in mind his foot barely moves his foot barely moves no no no he gets knocked to the ground okay let's watch that again it doesn't look like he got knocked to the ground he you're just mad that king kong is gonna win look you can see he doesn't get knocked to the ground okay he stands right back up now right here that's mecha godzilla right there because godzilla isn't chrome oh my bad godzilla isn't chrome so that was mecca godzilla and yes they're doing the traditional shoot at godzilla and then torpedoes okay just watch just watch that's mecca godzilla where you just saw him i didn't but okay boom he's legit off the ground imagine getting knocked to the ground by a lizard guys i think i messed up my webcam we can see that dude monkey no knock down monkey now tyler are you team godzilla or team i'm really both i freaking love both of them if they're fighting i'd be more on godzilla's side but i'm also on king kong side because i really don't care who wins i've just waited for this movie i mean i care who wins who do you want to win godzilla but it's not king kong's not really going to be fighting godzilla that much he's really just going to be fighting becca godzilla which is i don't know why it's like you're going too deep like i i can go on for hours about this yeah and i feel like you're overthinking it and i feel like that watch me be right i bet my house on that you bet your xbox no my house not my xbox you're right no you'd rather have your xbox than your house yeah then i could sell my xbox for a tent or you could have a house and an xbox nah gets knocked to the ground hold on hold on we gotta hear that we gotta hear that and not to keep in mind they're making godzi they're making king kong cheat by giving him an axe [Music] plasma through his damn throat no he can't what is he sad he's fire resistant he has to shoot it down his throat in order to take off his head he still has plasma abilities it's not plasma the least you can give him his [ __ ] an axe jesus man it's stupid he can grab a building for that he's a monkey a gorilla sorry um yeah he got slapped and by slapped i literally mean slapped so we're gonna go hong kong's still gonna win we're gonna go back here from one look at that doesn't get knocked down we go over here monkey gets knocked to the ground around all right guys so we're gonna probably end it off here oh no no no no not yet look yes yes yes yes he gets knocked to the ground the question is i'm not ending a 15 minute podcast i've been timing it's been 31. it has a liar it has you you're a liar it's been 32. but king kong got knocked to the ground guys meanwhile godzilla's over here sitting like an absolute beast he is bro king kong is going to win explain this then and and let me say one last thing [Music] now king kong is smart to guide that away from mexico king kong is smart to literally guide his atomic breath away but god's the real godzilla would know to stop and shoot it right back at him monkey monkey [Music] that's mechagodzilla's system that's mechagodzilla right there systems charge meaning he's charged this is their defense to stop godzilla they wanted it they're going to get the sword so comment down below

where this came from what up youtube this your boy las vegas nice and we made it to week number six yes we did oh yes we did before we get into the video shout out to my polo swag track fit track fit or track suit whatever you want to call it i like to call it a track fit hold on all right but anyway my track fit got the polo top hoodie that zips all the way down oh yeah and everything's brand new so when you see tags and stickers don't think oh you wear that every day no i just busted it out today for youtube you know what i'm saying the zip up yum yeah yeah that feel comfortable bro like you could just sit there you can sit there in any weather and don't care because it is cold out here in vegas right now i don't know what didn't happen i guess a cold front must have came in the sun because it's like it's been cold all week bro but anyway got the top we got the bottoms to match oh you know we can't do the top without the bottoms but so we gotta have the bottoms they're tapping the bottoms you understand swag you're on sand and then they cut off so swag right there like it ain't nothing dragging all on the floor it's just all sweat okay it's all swag how to hormone well i don't know where that's at but i know where this is at still got the tags after this video we will rip the tags off don't worry trolls i know some trolls be like oh but anyway i seen this movie uh the remake it was i this come on man stephen king what's going on you better writing books than making movies i see i never seen the original before but i seen it and it had a good plot to it but as far as how it ended like dude in the bathtub and then it says it on the wall and that's that come on man give me something else you heard make a part two of the original or something how'd it go from the original it to the remake way years later and then they made it it part two of the remake it all makes sense but anyway that's stephen king for you and by the way i don't like the way how stephen king allows racism in his movies because i i seen what was going on in it and i didn't like it it wouldn't have been me let's just put it that way it wouldn't have been me i don't know how it happened in history but it wouldn't have been me i'm just not one of them type of [ __ ] you know what i'm saying but uh now week six we got a lot to talk about a lot to discuss um first off i'm happy and kind of sort of disappointed at the same time because i should have known better but i just said [ __ ] it let me try it anyway i'm saying i'm happy because uh most of my uh blue gorillas created seed for me you know what i'm saying now that's like i las vegas knights is notorious for saying i would much rather have a plant that creates seed than a plant that creates blood because a plant that creates seed will create all that blood plus more you know what i'm saying so give me seed all day every day i'm saying i'll i have a place for everything i have a place for mail seeds for herme seeds and for male hermes or hermie males whatever [ __ ] you want to call them i take it off you know i'm saying because it adds to my inventory and it just makes my my whole grow go better because if i need males i can get male seeds if i need hermes i can get hermes seeds to sext out a plant that i need and boom create new seed now my seed inventory hold on my seed inventory is getting up there i'm talking about in the hundreds now um i don't plan i'm not one of them type of growers that no offense but i'm not one of them type of growers that like to just you know hand out seeds like here you go growers love and all that no bro we in a different time right now times the times right now is to the point where like you need to save everything you have home because you never know what's coming if [ __ ] hits the fan you see what's happening in the president you know presidency and all that [ __ ] i mean come on man i don't know it just looks us that's all i'm gonna say so you need to keep everything you got right now bro because if [ __ ] hits the fan and you don't gave away most of your seeds showing growers love and you only got like four seeds left then how did that make you look that make you look like boo boo or no you let me know cheers y'all and then we'll get into the whole seed thing i was talking about so cheers how that made me feel that hit right there and then we got some of this pineappley spread right here that that pineapple is it's some of that fire bro it's fluffy bomb uh phenol one was more hard nugs and it was more like a og kush type of smoke this these are more softer nugs it's more on the like uh like a bubble cushion type of smoke i'm saying this you know this is fino 2 pineapple express i'm saying now you see how these nugs they're not as big they're not as big as the blair witch ones because it's creating seed you see those seed pods is like uh like one right here one right there there's like another one right there another one right there right there but and it's crazy because these seeds okay let me just break it all down real quick okay excuse me now let me focus back on all right now these plants like i said they came from a male hermes you know what i'm saying plus a feminized uh gorilla glue well what was it nah okay that's what it was i had to think about what it was okay so these blue gorilla oh geez they came from a gorilla glue herme male and it came from a hermit uh dj short blueberry female so those two created a female herme blue gorilla og now what that is ah the light anyway all right this is all i want to show you i don't even know why i still got this hat on this right here my friends this is premium biochar what i'm saying when it comes to your gardening this right here is exactly what you need in the garden as far as an organic garden you know living soil if you're growing synthetically then you probably don't even need this [ __ ] but if you're an organic grower this oh man this will help your beneficial bacteria so this right here is biochar me use my auto focus on this that right there and what biochar is is just straight [ __ ] hold on let me turn it back all right y'all so basically all biochar is is just you feel me like uh burnt up ash or it's like the burnt up you know wood chips and like [ __ ] in nature [ __ ] uh um leaves all kinds of [ __ ] like everything like burnt up but not quite in that full ash that gray ash stage is like in that very beginning it's like in that charcoal your boy las vegas nice week number six we made it and we got seed boo yeah we out what up youtube pardon me if i sound kind of groggy um i just woke up yeah i'm saying just to chop this down and catch it before the lights come on you i'm saying today is uh november 4th at uh 8 p.m it's harvest day for my pineapple fino 2 auto by barney's farm the finish time was exactly eight weeks the first day in week eight or 50 days in flower or day number 98 from seed so just shy of 100 days from seed i'm saying just shy by two days so let's get into the plant real quick now this plant is fat like it's way more squat and chunkier than the last one so this one right here should indeed last us at least until my other flowers are in week number eight you know what i'm saying i just chopped this down so i'm filming it right now before the leaves droop over and cover up the bud so this is the perfect time to film so let's get in there real quick we might have some fungus gnats here and there stuck to the buds because the buds are just sticky icky oh we herb yeah this one's gonna smoke bruh bruh yes yeah but let me get the fattest nug real quick hold on let me get the fattest snug which is that one right there walking in the winter wonderland [Music] here so again this snug right here should be about a quarter ounce nut eyeball the rest of these small ones like that one that one this one that one that one that one that one that one should all be eights so eyeballing um eyeballing i'll say we got about an ounce and a half just off this one pineapple auto about an ounce and a half could be wrong i was accurate with my pineapple express female number one when i said i shouldn't get more than a quarter ounce but indeed i got 8.3 grams off of that first one this one i predict i'm gonna get about 30 grams i'm gonna get about 30 grams nah i should get a little more than that i'ma get about 40 grams that's my prediction y'all i could be wrong but i'm guessing i should get about 40 grams from this from this plant you know what i'm saying so that should be an ounce exactly an ounce and 12 grams because the ounce is 28 grams i'm saying plus 12 that's 40 grams exactly so that should be an ounce plus a quarter ounce plus an eighth of an ounce equals 40 ounces and that's that i should have had my coca-cola cannon here to compare matter of fact let me grab that i'll be right back all right so instead of a coca-cola can this time we're going to use a sprite can just for comparison purposes it's not as fat as the can but just so you could kind of get an idea of exactly how chunky these nugs are yeah i'm saying boom this one right here not as chunky and then this one right here not as chunky but indeed he got my whole [ __ ] smelling like bom bom bom bye bye bye bye bye bye i'm out what's up youtube oh happy day oh happy day because you already know that your boy is finna sell but yeah it's a oh happy day because your boyfriend's self both with my last two pair of air jordan bread 11 2019 version size 12 men's retail 220 i'm flipping them and selling them for 300 a piece well i'ma sell one pair for 250 and the other pair for 300. originally you're supposed to be both paired 300 but i told them i was like uh all right if you buy both pair at the same time i'll drop off a little bit i'm saying i'll drop off 50 50 bucks why not i've been sitting on these shoes long enough you know what i'm saying and that is the flip right there that's why i love buying uh unique legit jordans that everybody wants like a hot commodity every year jordan comes out with that one shoe that everybody in a mama be fighting for 2019 was these right here yeah i'm saying 2020 was the uh i think it was the 12s the university of black and gold 12s but i couldn't even get my hands on those boy i'm tomorrow y'all saw the video i made i was waiting in line doing this doing that and then man that [ __ ] was crazy i couldn't even get in a i'm still hot i still want to pair them university 12s but anyway these i'm gonna just get it real quick if i sell them off are the bread elevens bro aka the shoes that jordan wore i believe he wore these when he had the flu i'm saying when he was knocking down all them shots let's just listen to them just get one more oh and don't think i sold all four pair and didn't keep a pair for myself you already know i got a pair in the closet never worn yet and you already know i picked the best looking pair because i looked at every one of these shoes all five pairs i looked at them looked at all the flaws if they had flaws i was selling them if they didn't have flaws that would be the pair i kept and indeed the pair that i kept has no flaws at all i'm saying got the nike air inside got the little jordan tree i don't want to pull it out of that one because the laces is too tight but uh i'll pull it out of this one though i don't want to mess them up before the seller gets them because that'll be all got the jordan got the jordan tree shoe tree nice got the receipts shoe padlets when i buy these december 14 2019 maryland parkway big baby out the door 238 and this is the jordan card it's kind of weird it's not a typical jordan card but it's a jordan card nonetheless i'm saying oh yeah when he was flying in the air this symbol he was wearing these shoes if y'all didn't know that's why they dedicated this jordan they dedicated this jordan to these bread 11's because this symbol this jumpman symbol came from these shoes the shoes he got on in this jumpman symbol are the bread 11's if y'all didn't know that these right here all right y'all time to make my moneys or my shmonies as bobby schmurder would say uh how

gonna get that and i'm gonna get a poster of the united states we did it youtube okay so i had i have 550 but i spent about 130 at walmart because y'all know that [ __ ] that you always need but you like it's like really unnecessary but you like you try to wait for the perfect time to get it like when you got just throw away money just to buy [ __ ] that you always wanted to get but didn't want to really spend your money on that's the kind of [ __ ] that i got at walmart like this [ __ ] out like i needed a new laundry basket like hella bad but i was like man i ain't about to buy no new one but with the jordan money we did it i'm saying we got that we got this we got a motherf i'm buying [ __ ] i don't even know why i'm buying i bought a fishing rod bro huh [ __ ] bought a fishing rod i'm saying all kinds all kind got some more tank tops because you know las vegas nice notorious for wearing the uh the teasies i'm saying i got all kinds of [ __ ] just like a hundred dollars worth of [ __ ] i'm saying but happy yes yes yes yes yes yes i'm saying this is what it's all about this is this is what makes america great i don't know about no president but as far as the hustle the hustle makes america great again good shot hey yo they had these they had these as smiths though huh yeah i'm saying the checkers fries though i was like oh [ __ ] i have to get these and you eat some of those you eat some of those with some of this uh a sweet baby rash honey barbecue cause the sauce makes it boss all right so before i go to the hydro store we gots to get us some kabob express bro this is that [ __ ] bro yeah i'm saying the pita bread the chicken chicken kebab the rice salad and lemonade you gotta light up after a good meal i'm speechless i can't even talk right now is the perfect time to light up some of this up pineapple express won't i like to take the first puff and then blow it out what i'm saying because that's all that [ __ ] butane like that and then after that should be good to go oh yeah up next hi joe store gone let's go on a little afternoon ride show in fabulous las vegas it's a cloudy day today and that's rare oh [ __ ] but the legion stadium looking nice as always it makes me happy oh [ __ ] you know you don't [ __ ] up when the cop you know you don't [ __ ] up when the cops uh taking off your plates say in order for the cops to be taken off your place that must mean you using fake plates and that is a big crime oh yeah cdu yeah let's go to japan [Music] uh [Music] so what up youtube it's your boy las vegas nights we've officially made it to week number six flower most of my plants again are creating seed so when your plants create seed it's going to make some of the buds smaller than what they should be in week six because you know in week six you're supposed to have those fat ass [ __ ] nugs but most of my plants are creating seed so indeed you're gonna have smaller nugs but nonetheless you're gonna have seed for future offspring you know what i'm saying so my lights are about to cut off let me just not even waste time and let's get straight to the blair witch right here as you can see the blair witch is also creating seed for me right here is a seed pod boom so indeed i will be able to continue my blair witch genetics because sadly the clone of blair witch just didn't make it it just it just got limp on me that was the only one that didn't make it as far as clones go all the other ones they still thriving blair witch just tapped out on me so i know with this strain it's a no bueno when it comes to clones this is not a cloner some plants just are like that some plants don't clone some plants clone and some just don't take off with the cloning i'm saying i had a girl scout a cookie plant that just would not clone for me i mean i took like four different clones and they all just died within the first like week so it depends on the genetics the strain this is more right here and don't worry about the yellow leaves y'all i already know what i did wrong and my next grow i hope i won't have none of these problems because i know exactly what to do to keep the lush green and the leaves um i'm gonna give it a little bit more of a nitrogen boost in flour that's my main thing that i don't like really do that i probably should is uh add any nitrogen into my flour mix and that's why the leaves start to [ __ ] fade away and turn yellow and [ __ ] because it's i mean there's no point you know what i'm saying we already done vegging so it's flower time but now i'm gonna start adding a little bit more of a nitrogen boost in the flour mix i'm gonna probably add some like coffee grounds a lot more coffee grounds because coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen so let's keep it going uh more blair witch right here again number two right here this is ten two so um i wanted to start with this tent first because ten one is looking a little bit shady on the [ __ ] you know what i'm saying just a little bit shady all right let's just get some of the nuggets real quick [Music] boom and also i'm uh i'm probably only going to feed these plants they're only in week six but i'm probably only going like watering probably another couple more times because i really really really want this soil to dry the [ __ ] up i'm getting tired of this gnat issue it doesn't got worse this is probably the worst infestation i don't had throughout my whole five years growing and i know what it is is because the more organic matter you put into the soil amendment the more that you're gonna attract and that's just the way it's gonna be and that's love like you know nature type organic-y type [ __ ] and you just gotta deal with it you either gotta get you some predator predator uh you know like mites or something that'll fight off the gnats like ladybugs those are uh beneficial predators it's a lot of [ __ ] all right so let's move on to the nyc diesel now this plant i was hoping that it was going to get nice and fat for me because you know nyc diesel that's just that [ __ ] but even she i think i seen a couple seed pods on her too let me look around real quick but look at the frost though hold on look good okay so i think i see a seed pod right there but um let's just zoom in and look at the frost action that's organic frost oh let's just get another nug but yeah that's organic frost right there y'all that's organic frost you smell me organic frost let's get a few more nugs and we'll move on i think that's the seed pod right there right right there yes oh my nyc diesel giving me seed pods i don't even know what i'll name this one i think i see a few more up there nyc diesel crossed with nyc diesel what's a good new york type of name for this i don't even know but i'll figure something out i might not even name it nothing has to do with new york either i might name it some other horror [ __ ] that i love oh here's a nice seed pod right here look at that seed pod right there right where my finger is boom and it's full of trichomes look at that seed pod that [ __ ] that looks like it's gonna be one healthy seed right there my goodness yes sir all right that's our nyc diesel vino number two looking righteous if i do say so myself all right let's move on to the blue gorilla random fingers and now that i know that these blue gorillas are hermione on me the only one that i got a clone of was this one right here as far as blue gorillas go and this one indeed is a true herme but it's a light blooming hermit i'm saying you see that seed pod right there hold up yes yeah so what i might wind up doing is destroying the clone of this one because i don't you know if all the blue gorillas are gonna hurt me on me and [ __ ] create seed there's no sense in me keeping it because it's just gonna hurt me at the end of the day and i don't want to risk [ __ ] pollinating nothing that i don't want a pollen right now i'm saying and lastly in this room candy kush and i think even our candy kush has seed pods oh real quick let me zoom in real quick y'all i'm tripping here we go there we go candy kush candy kush is fox tailing on me a little bit like this this bud right here slight foxtail but it's no problem all right and that's tent number two let's move on to tent one tent one looking slightly better content too but we still have a lot of fox tailing due to the uh light intensity in this room a lot of fox tailing but we have seed though and that's all that matters we have plenty of seed for future grows right here these buds are big enough where i can smoke them take seeds i'm getting the best of both worlds y'all i'll be able to smoke this bud i'll be able to smoke this bud but i won't the only thing i hate when i uh smoke uh seated buds is that i can't put it in the grinder and grind it up you have to when you have seated bud you have to grind it by hand i'm saying and just do it like that i'm saying roll up your blunt take the seeds out and that's how i've been doing it for years you know what i'm saying man i'ma give these eight weeks instead of nine by eight weeks it should give these seeds time to mature they could they they might be mature now but i'm gonna give them that couple more week stretch you know what i'm saying look at that foxtail though but that's all because of this spider farmer and this will no longer be in here because i should not have fox tailing in the winter time it should not happen fox tailing is due to uh heat stress i'm saying so the temperatures are right in here but still got it going on let's move on this is another blue gorilla right here nice fat mature seeds popping off i know i [ __ ] told y'all i was gonna get a pound grow well not this one i thought when when they were first growing i was like oh yeah i'm gonna get a pound grow but if i'm gonna get seed i would much rather take that seed than a pound of bud any day you know what i'm saying this is my nyc diesel final two i don't know what happened to her i mean she just completely shut down on me but it's all good though these nugs they look like they they gonna smoke just right bro yeah i'm saying these nugs are like they gonna smoke just right look at them hold on they frosty now let me get in there you can't say these nugs ain't frosty i'll say uh 2020 has been my trial and error year i've did a lot of things tested out a lot of things i converted completely to organic this year um so yeah i'll say 2020 is las vegas night's transitional year into becoming a professional grower bro because you got to go through trial and error in order to become that professional grower i'm saying professional professional growers they don't just [ __ ] pop up out of nowhere overnight they gotta go through a lot of test runs a lot of fails a lot of successes in order to get to the phase that they're at right now i'm saying this right here is our lemon our hairy lemon and even our hairy lemon has gave us seed at the top of that two fat seed pods on the top of her and there's another one right there harry lemon harry lemon yeah let's move on to this uh blue gorilla this blue gorilla is just straight cd on me doing exactly what her father did because this is exactly what her father did the blue gorilla well the gorilla glue that it came from it seated up just like this like all but all this was seed though it was no bud i'm saying but this one looks the most like her uh her father i'm saying so i got to make a mental note if i want to continue a genetic i might have to just grow like a like a blue gorilla right next to it so hopefully it'll pollinate it and i'm saying with the with the all right and this last but not least is another blue gorilla this one looks more like a a female hermie than a male this took on the male hermit traits this one took on more of the female hermit traits because the buds are just a little bit more fat the show we got plenty of buds plenty of seeds plenty of everything my seed inventory is about to go up another couple hundred seeds and that's what it do and those are my two cactuses and last but not least let me show y'all the sunflowers and that should be a wrap i'm saying i think they already cut off on me yep [ __ ] i don't never catch the sunflowers in time but and that's another thing with my light schedule uh this next grow i'm gonna make sure my light schedule starts when i come home from work because it's cold enough now where i could leave the lights on all day and not have to worry about a heat issue so let me just move this chair up freaking way and let's get to come on let's get to these sunflowers so these sunflowers have reached the end of their lives before i get to them let me make sure i didn't mess up my timer because that usually happens when i get over here all right so my sunflowers have reached the end of their life this is like the final stage right here um so what's happening is um these heads are getting rock hard and heavy super heavy because uh seeds are being created and no more pollen is coming off of these because uh all the pollen is gone now so right now they're just forming sunflower seeds inside this head i'm saying nice fat fat heads this one right here is oh [ __ ] i don't even want to touch it because i got leaves crumbling off but yeah she's uh they're all getting fat for me look at that a fat head right there i'm saying looking good a1 all right y'all this [ __ ] boy las vegas nights i hope uh my week six to week eight videos are not gonna be a disappointment to some of y'all it might be but at the end of the day again i'm getting seed this was unexpected but i should have known better because that uh these blue gorillas came from a hermit from herme parents so i should have known that there was a 50 50 chance that these were gonna hurt me and sure enough they heard me on me so trial and error you know i'm saying but that being said your boy las vegas nice like comment subscribe and stay tuned to week number seven we out peace these nugs are so sticky bruh these nugs are so sticky and that's the fat one right there that i said it's probably gonna be about a quarter ounce nug maybe less maybe more i don't know rough prediction let's just go around oh look at the milk i call a lot of trichomes clustered together like like around right here this is just milk it's just milk look at all that milk um we want to get that milk", "i1m0Dy6G-_o": "[Music] this ends now only making it worse for yourself quit while you can hulk break your claws this time little man anime power-up time

today's video make sure you like comment and subscribe and i hope to see you guys all in my next video bye guys [Music] you", "63YnOQfUeHw": "action what's up guys Jason Lisbon blue-collar outdoors and if you're watching this video you probably saw my part one of the gorilla bow and then my part two with 360 pound bench kit that comes with it now on this video I'm going to show you a little trick to get just a little bit more resistance I mean for most 360 that's gonna be plenty but if you're really trying to load up in a safe manner it'd be like doing negative sets this trick will be good for you so we got the gorilla bow out let me get it banded up and then I'll be back to you stay tuned alright guys so a little trick I learned now I got all four bands on this here these are for the 90-pound short resistance bands but I got actually this is supposed to go on the bar itself for squatted but what I do is I like to use this this beam and then I can use that to manipulate the distance thus increase in the resistance so you can take and put that on there and then you could bench off of this now I haven't tried this with all four bands I've tried it with two bands and it's heavy because you're essentially hitting that well you're going pass the band's load earlier so it's more of the rep is that actually past the 90 pound resistance so let me sneak in here so as you can tell I mean that's pulling in hard right now now like I said I haven't tried this with the four bands but just this extra distance is increasing the rep load well I should say the weight load on your pecs but still your forms gotta be key so get all the way up and I always put it rate square my shoulder blades so when I pinch my shoulder blades back I can feel that they're pinched could definitely use that that squat cover to protect the bands for this but you could use a tree you could use whatever but then you just pinch shoulder blades back and press it's heavy and you're hitting that mass load and pushing the bands to their full resistance and pass about halfway so it's actually giving you a really good pump but you got to keep your shoulders back so you're not pushing your chest how are your shoulders into it alright so I'm gonna do a couple more reps like I said you want to make sure everything's in line you don't want to be too high you don't wanna be too low I go arms with shoulder blades back oh that's heavy all right let me wheeze a lot out here okay so this little trick I'm not saying to throw for the 90-pound bands on go with what's good for you although one thing I have learned about using this through workouts is one benefit is when say a free weight bench press Hawk and I have done this thousand times you know you take you take your max then you go a plate above it and then I'll spot for them and I have them drop it down slow to his chest it's a negative and then I help him get it up that's putting more load than you're used to on your packs thus you know promoting a lot more strength gains this is a lot safer way of doing it because you're not gonna drop a bar on you at least that can happens is this going to pinch tight on you but I'll tell you that felt more like 385 405 somewhere in there and honestly you can manipulate the distance between it I like keeping my back to it like it would be on a bench press and this is just a little trick I've learned to really get the most out of this until I can put slam some plates on and benchpress heavy so this is a good way to get by I'll tell you right now that's you can hear me I'm out of breath right now that that is heavy that is a good workout but this is just a quick tip on manipulating distance you can do this on your lap poles you could do it on pretty much anything you can get a distance on it so this is Jake's Liesman blue collar outdoors make sure to smash that thumbs up button and if you're new to the channel which you most likely will be if you're seeing these videos we upload Monday Wednesday Friday we're very religious on that and we throw in random uploads throughout the week if we can so we're very active on the channel a lot of outdoors and we're gonna start implementing more workouts in it too because y'all are asking for it so we're gonna get it to you but like I said Jake's losing blue collar outdoors we got some pattern tests of film take your easy", "HKjyDppcgC8": "what's going on y'all bring the hood here for the green thumb diaries here to welcome you all to my first experiment for my last post I got the heavy hitters pack for my love growing marijuana calm so I got some some goodies going on it's been three weeks since my last pokes I didn't want to bore y'all with the beginning parts you know it's just this regular vegetative growth going on so I feel like I want to be the seed review person for y'all so the site that I get my seeds from that I just mentioned before you know I wouldn't mind just grabbing these packs and you know see what see but these products do because they're you know they're mixed pack so after I get done with the comparison with with this first experiment I'll probably get the purple pack and review those seeds and see how that goes so you know it's gonna be a fun ordeal so let's see what's going on so at this point if you've seen my last post I started them all at same time [Music] I got some gorilla glue let's go ahead to the all right now this is that blue drink that was started as Cup and it's my last and my last post now I thought I kind of feel like this blue dream got a little a little advantage I'm not gonna say it's a fair unfair advantage but I have to say that uh this great right right here this great white man I've sprinkled it before I took it off this this Cup right here I sprinkled it before I put in in this Cup right here and I feel like she just took off after that so I have to I have to give major props I'm not getting paid from this company man with just this stuff right here is really really good but yes she's sprouted man like like I said three weeks ago man she's not ready to get trained which would be my next post show y'all have trained these plants man I want to take advantage of these it's better than stage because that's when you can manipulate the plants and whatnot so what I did was I let it grow with this cup right here no you put a little hole at the bottom of it just like in my last post I'll let it grow for two weeks in there the two plants in there which is also gorilla glue and blue drinks I'll let them sit there and I fed them a quarter of the recommended dose of this pamphlet here so basically I didn't start feeding her until she was ready to come up out of this Cup if that's what you need to understand you know when you feed what I did was I put the OSHA for so long and up with the happy for all together a little pellets in there if you see my last [ __ ] you know I went in depth with that but you put that together man that plant don't need nothing for the next two weeks man as soon as it comes out of this cup that's when you start feeding and that's not the point on that right now so I'm on Wheaton one all right week one so last week I did the seedlings schedule but now I'm all week one well obviously this plant is older than with one week but I find that if you give it some time to grow with the soil naturally what I was giving it any additives you give the chance to for the roots to grow and when you do give it that full strength they're able to obtain it and that way you're not burning it because I could have started at the company stage or week one two weeks ago well I feel like you wouldn't never received it right all right but this is this is this is really good good results all right same like I said these are the other two that I started on my last pose this is gorilla blue which is really competitive to the one on a pool table man I tell you what I wish I would have switched up the rows because she probably would have been booming with that uh that great short stuff so it's all good though you know she popped off first I felt like these these two popped off at the same time so I you know I felt like no one's competitive but she's not doing too bad either she just means she's moving at her own pace you know she's not looking sickly or nothing so I'm not really worried about that so you know right now like I said before I'm on week one you know but I added a little something I got boomerang I put a little boomerang in there managed it took off I tell you no lie they took off man so what we going to do in the next post is I'm going to train these fans you know you gotta train them pitch Bend I'm silly all that man so what you want to do is you want to get even even situations man [Music] so that's all I got for y'all right now man keep the fire up please check me out on the next closed", "bj4FEabQkvc": "so today i'm going to be riding this new trail which i've never seen before so it's an off piece line up at holden and it's on the red trail side and now i'm going to show you how to get to this bit and then i'll show you how the trail is and what it's like to ride so coming off from the red trail you want to turn right and you should get around here follow the path until you find the trail so now let's drop into the off piece line [Music] so there are a few tight trees around so this trail is one of like the hidden gems it was hard for me to find but i found it and it's amazing to ride you'll soon see how some of the lower sections are even better so at the end there's a little bit of fun as a steep downhill just like to pop off the trail and then we can look into some of the more technical sections a bit lower down so this is the line that i'm going to be taking in the background you can see the trail that we came off and then we're going to be going down this trail although there are a few sticks and logs over it it's fine from further on if you want to do the next section of the trail there's another line going a bit further down which i'm going to show you just in a second so what we're going to do is there a line down there which i think leads to the bottom of the red trail around like the fire road area so here you can see that coming off to the red trail to the side there's the off piece line and this is the final bottom section of the off piece line so if your balance isn't that good you might avoid the section as to the right side there's a pretty big drop as this section is pretty technical you might not want to go too fast as it's not the best if you fall off so here's a steep muddy up and down bit uh like a ditch where is a ditch and continuing on we have a fast fun and kind of flowy section so i was going slightly slow as i didn't know what was ahead of me at all as this was the first time riding around all the trail there's a few deep roots which you just want to be careful on as they're very slippy especially in the wet so this section is one of the more flowy sections of the trail uh so you can build up a bit of speed to get down to the very bottom hi this is so much fun this time so overall this trail is a pretty good trail i've never seen it before although i don't actually know where it comes out which we're going to find out just now it's really technical it's really fun and a few sections you want to miss out so whether it's like the bottom section if you don't to finish the entire trail and you just want to continue on with the red so i think that's why this trail is pretty good so i don't actually know where it is but here is where we come out on the map so we cycle up this road and we will arrive at the main place where we started so although the cycle up back to the red trail is a little bit annoying you get some amazing views on the way so if you keep following the road you'll eventually get here so this is where the red trail is and now let's go home so hopefully you now know how to find this trail if you're struggling a little bit with the instructions comment down below and i'll hopefully reply make sure to like and subscribe and i'll see you in my next video next week [Music] [Music] you", "6mFjDUJs7dE": "[Music] greetings fellow humans suburban herb here welcome to the second grow annual guest yield contest sponsored by thebeseeds.com if you're the type of human that likes to win free stuff make sure you guess the mass of the grass and put it down in the comments also your mom called she said you should subscribe i'm not even kidding your mom's been all up in my dms welcome back my friends it is day 54 here for these gorilla glues so we have almost completed eight full weeks of flour does that mean it's time to harvest well let's take a look last time we had a video we took a look at some of the trichomes and i just took a few more snaps but what i'm really is going to make me decide is actually looking at the plants looking at the buds themselves because basically they've entered into their harvest window they they could have been harvested a few days ago by some people's standards and probably a week or two weeks from now even by some other people's standards and so anywhere in between the harvest window is probably a couple weeks long so in my case um what i've been doing is just taking a look at the bud so i i i did consider and i've considered it before a multi-stage harvest and that would be effectively removing the top highest colas and then leaving the undergrowth a little more time to uh prosper under the lights interesting idea presumably it works i assume it's been done by lots of people um my i haven't looked into it at all one consideration that i would have is if you stress the plants to that degree is are you really gonna get much growth out of them if if they sit around for another three or four days i i don't know i would have to research that but the reason i wouldn't do it in my particular case is simply uh just that it would make things more difficult each step going forward in other words drying curing if i'm doing it in two steps and two different that are five days apart so for me it's just easier to uh harvest all at one time and really that time as far as i'm concerned is basically about now and and the the real deciding factor is looking down at our fallen soldiers down here um even the ones that are lying down on the scrog and they're they're good i don't know like 26 28 inches under the lights there those buds are looking pretty mature so that really is deciding factor and these ones here for certain are ready to go [Music] foreign blitz is the greatest dog unless [Music] we were talking about that thing that we thought maybe blitz i have a question for you as you know we are about to harvest so it's the perfect time to ask what is the ideal drying temperature and humidity and length of time for drying your cannabis i think we were seeing signs of life he's getting an answer ready this should be an easy one ideal relative humidity when drying cannabis should be in the 50 to 55 range with temperature in the 65 to 70 degree fahrenheit range for a 10 to 14 day period is that it am i done well it's not always that easy depending on where you live you'll probably face different issues when trying to maintain this ideal environment you may need to add or remove humidity with a humidifier or even add a heater or an air conditioner to control your temperature for many of us we already have a controlled environment in our tents which can be the perfect place to dry your cannabis if you're willing to give up the grow space for a couple weeks but for those of us that can't you can always create a makeshift drying room somewhere in your house in my case i choose a bathroom as i often have to run a humidifier to raise the humidity during drying i could also use wet towels or leave water in the sink or bath to raise the humidity if you have difficulty extending your drying time as i do you can always leave more leaf and stem with the buds during drying or even harvest closer to the last watering both of which will bring more moisture into your drying room if you have too much humidity your options are removing more leaf and stem or using a dupidifier drying your cannabis improperly can literally ruin your months of hard work so blitz suggests that maintaining your drying environment is worth a little effort so the answer is simple it's just not that easy now back to the [Music] show [Music] so [Music] here we go so it has now been exactly three weeks since transplant so how are they they're doing pretty good pretty good not much has changed in the last week if you recall i was having some brown spot 18 issues uh and uh that i attacked with a calming foliar spray which seemed to work so what i did was uh just as my lights were going off um three days in a row or three out of five i gave them a mist of cal mag there were actually three plants you can probably still see you should be able to definitely see it on here and possibly on the back plant now in the new growth um this had already been out when i started spraying and uh they this one had to get still got a tiny little bit on it it's new leaves this one has none and he has none she heard me so um that seems to have resolved that problem and i i think i can say that um with some certainty because i also did not feed them during that period so during that approximately five days they didn't receive any nutrients in their soil so they just all the plants just only those three were receiving this foliar spray so i can maybe assume it worked anyway i won't hesitate to try it again so uh that's that um we got one girl there that's clearly a little bit yellow she's in just the two gallon pot so part of the reason that i am harvesting within 48 hours it's part of the consideration is um i'm gonna split these up into the two tents and those two girls that are in the two gallons are going to get put into five gallon pots but i actually don't have any and didn't order any so i was waiting to get one of these pots that makes no sense really because i'm probably not we're gonna wanna uh clear them out so i'll probably just order some pots and transplant those but i think i'm gonna split these girls up into these two tents uh otherwise the one issue that i can take credit for here is i think i've done it again and i did this in on my very first girl my very first girl my plants they were quite beautiful but they were literally two and a half three feet tall as compared to or two and a half probably as a compared to these girls who are uh like about five eight over there in heels so what i've done i believe i did it again um is i set my lights too low for the first couple weeks what i think catches me by surprise is how much they grow so here's here's why i'm coming to that conclusion um it would seem to me that a a fan leaf of this size a hand sized fan leaf and an in this small kind of size of plant tells me that it's there's seemingly wasted growth coming out into those leaves that should be going elsewhere into upward growth like this is outsized so too much growth has gone horizontally i think as opposed to vertically this is just me using my logical brain and trying to assume i know what's going on as opposed to just assuming it's some kind of genetic thing but because i have it in a bunch of the plants and two different strains i'm guessing that i was crowding too much with my lights which caused them to put more resources into going out because they didn't need to go up that is a guess but and it's not a big deal not a big deal but i believe that it's not ideal so other than that we're all pretty good the viper specter p 2500 is performing like the boss okay um the other thing i have to mention especially today because it is the official guess the yield part two is i have to thank and give shout out to the bee seeds who provided the seeds for these particular plants right here and they are also providing the prizes for the guest yield contest so if you need some seeds and you want some plants that look like that and you you live somewhere in this world because he delivers everywhere on the planet i think that gets deliveries and he accepts visas and debit cards okay mother lovers it's time for me and blitz to head to funky town but in the meantime if you haven't yet entered the guess the yield 2 contest enter your guess under this video in the comments section until the contest deadline march 31st 2021 and since you're down there and you insist on pushing my buttons how about pushing the like and subscribe all the cool kids are doing it whatevs see you next time [Music] please [Music] you", "Nuofag457EI": "what up y'all i'm sitting here finna smoke this blunt it's like four in the morning but i just got done watching this movie this is like a grade a movie the shawshank redemption with morgan freeman but uh i was so high i was just like reading the [ __ ] cast and uh look at the cast you got you got your boy fat ass frank madreno hey guys i was in the shawshank redemption i was fat ass so what up y'all i just wanted to show y'all my progress of my blue scotch curled kale i mean look at look at that i just uh did a little bit of harvesting from the bottom the bottom leaves because uh it's always good to harvest the bottom leaves to give the top leaves more action so i just harvested uh but look at all that look at all that biofilm on there the show for sure yeah we gonna eat one of these raw right now some of the best vegetables money to buy organics baby what up y'all so i'm in the process of making another compost tea from now on i'm gonna try to at least make a compost for my plants like every two weeks every week is too just too extreme i mean every two weeks should keep the microbes alive i'm saying i mean my soil is happy if you water it every day the microbes should stay alive until the next compost tea you know i'm saying anyway um so in case you guys don't have uh compost tea bags or you just don't know what to use what i usually use is uh my old socks that have holes in it now when my socks get to the point where they start i've i didn't had these socks for years but once they get to the point where they start getting holes like this one excuse me or like that one or even this right here once i see one hole in my sock then i don't just throw my socks away i use my socks for compost tea bags i'm saying these are the perfect compost tea bags the only problem with socks is is a one-time use because once you use it you got to toss the whole thing with the with the mulch earthworm castings all wet up in it you don't want to take all that out and then wash it it's just too much just for a compost tea bag so what i do all these are one-time uses once i get through with all these i'm gonna have to figure out something else but i got a lot of old socks like this is just half of them you know what i'm saying i've been using my old socks for the past while now this one is another one that has a hole in it what i do is fill it up with the earthworm castings and compost tie a knot on it throw it in my compost tea water but you can't stop there you gotta have candy you gotta treat your microbes in your soil similar to children now children love candy same with microbes microbes love something sweet so this right here is three tablespoons full of molasses with a little bit of water just enough so i could shake it up and get it to a water consistency i'm saying and then after that i just put my put this in here uh tie it up onto the handle so it doesn't float to the bottom and then when it starts bubbling i slowly pour my molasses in there and voila that's how i do it all right let me get it started and i'll show y'all all right so we got her bubbling now what i like to do is i like to squeeze when i freshly put the bag in there you see how the water is just clear right some growers they just put their tea bag in there and they just let it naturally brew out what i like to do is i like to make sure that the remnants of the mulch and the earthworm castings already are getting circulated within the teeth so what i like to do is massage gently massage my compost tea bag but not enough to have a lot of sediment coming out just enough to get it nice and brown now this is what i'm talking about i just put this in here i like to slowly massage just give it a nice massage a massage but yeah just see i could already feel a clump in there i feel a clump that's probably from the the mulch just give it a nice massage you feel me not too hard just enough to break down some of these lumps in there and get that nice and circulated and boom there it is circulation complete bubbles complete hand smells like [ __ ] and let's add the final ingredient final ingredient is our this is what creates the uh beneficial bacteria well this is what makes them form right here there's some nice sweets in us as you can see them bubbles they already started to get a little bigger you're not going to see a lot of bubble action when you first start you gotta close the lid and just leave it alone then open it up about five hours later just to check to see if you got bubbles if you got a lot of bubble action that means you doing right you're on the right track all right so right now it is let's see what time it is right now is 8 30 at night um 85 degrees perfect for my compost tea you need at least a little bit of heat to get it going so 8 35 or 8 30 i'll just keep it at 8 30. so it's the 20th sunday so i'm gonna let this time i'm gonna let it brew for about 48 hours i never did a 48 hour brew but i need to start stepping it up a notch the most i ever do on compost is 24 hours i'm gonna do 48 hours let it really get there all right so let me put the lid on this and that's compost you what up y'all it's uh september 22nd at 6 54 in the morning um i started my compost tea at 8 30 p.m on the 20th today is the 22nd at 7. well it's about to be seven in five minutes but uh it's going on a 35 and a half hour brew because you remember i told y'all remember i told you i wanted to do a 48 hour brew uh 35 hours is close enough you feel me um and once i feed my plants this brew right here bro y'all already see the growth happening right now when i feed them this last compost oh my goodness i believe they gonna just explode bro like especially this one right here just explode you know i'm saying because a 35 hour brew let's see the results real quick i haven't even looked in here yet i just came home from work like fresh through the [ __ ] car keys on the counter and just ran straight into the grow room just to see what's going on so that being said let's look at the compost tea all right right there i keep a cloth on top of the container because uh it's always an opening right here and that'll just prevent any gnats to try to go up in there in my my my look at that beneficial bacteria thrive yes yes all right we ain't going to spend too much time looking at that because i want to get that in the soil aside [Music] yes sir all right so let me feed the plants so yeah by the way i know y'all see a lot of scraps in the soil um my new venture the reason why i said last time let me cover that back up reason why i said last time that i think i've mastered the art of marijuana is because in order to master the art of marijuana growing you have to master the art of living soil once you treat the soil like a plant then the soil will take care of the plant so you don't even have to worry about the plant really this grow i'm not even concerned about the plants my main focus is to feed the soil the soil is what i'm feeding i'm not even i could give two shits less about the plants even though that's not true but in theory i'm feeding the soil right now yeah i'm saying so i was at smith's yesterday um i was buying some kale and i seen they had like a big ass [ __ ] box of just like the produce guy he had a big box of just like leftover scraps and just a whole bunch of old produce that was in the box and i asked him like what you gonna do with that and he was i'm about to just throw this away i was like let me have that bro so he gave it to me i rinsed it down real well at the house like two to three times rinse down all that old produce and i threw it in each one of these containers just a little bit and i did that yesterday and as you can see it's already starting to shrivel up so let's see if the soil enjoys this little feast they're about to have all right y'all enough talking i'm about to get the water in and i highlight y'all again today is the 22nd so the next time y'all see me more than likely it's gonna be around light switch time um it's monday i was planning on switching my lights i was planning on switching my lights uh like tomorrow just so by the time the first comes the first could be like day one a flower but i want to really give these plants some more time to grow so [Music] we got some more time to go all right y'all let me feed these plants i'm out what up youtube i just want to show y'all how a grown man eats you feel me i got the t-bone steak you got the tea right there the t-bone came fresh out of this skillet it's still hot what you want to do with your steak is when you're done cooking it you got to let it sit that's the key i'm saying i was watching a gordon ramsay steak video a while back but he said let it sit for at least 10 minutes before you eat it so for one it could cool down and for two all those flavors could marinate yeah i'm saying that's what you want so i got some steak and some rice you know what i'm saying boy that steak looks so good my mouth water all you need is a knife a fork something to drink show time oh in a blunt and i'll get that rolled up right now [Music] [Music] what up y'all so it's tuesday september 22nd but this video is dedicated strictly to this kale bro like oh my god bro this [ __ ] looks so [ __ ] beautiful huh look at that [Music] the size of my hand bro i'm six too and look at this it's the size of my home and this one's even bigger this one right here look at the veins in it though look at the veins what up y'all i'm at the post office on a saturday afternoon just got done doing laundry and said oh yeah i did order some seeds from ebay now when [ __ ] hits the fan and you don't have anything else to roll with if you got some bomb ass weed you don't got nothing to roll with this is the [ __ ] solution right here i'm gonna show y'all what i got so let me just get it all associated all right so this is what i got so what i got was i think this is a thousand um virginia gold tobacco leaves i mean a tobacco seed so this is a thousand so yeah i'm saying all y'all that roll up swishers and you feel me dutches and backwoods and all that this right here this is gonna be all natural tobacco for real a lot of people claim they got all natural tobacco but you still be feeling dizzy after you smoke that [ __ ] you know i'm saying but with this though this is a real this came from a real tobacco plant you know i'm saying and i got it from ebay i think it was five dollars for a thousand but if [ __ ] ever hits the fan you're gonna need some tobacco plants to add to the garden i'm saying and it's not just for you know blunts you could actually crumble up the leaves and instead of a blunt you can make a whole bunch of cigarettes all natural cigarettes so thank you and enjoy your harvest sam thank you sam so he's just showing the directions let me just read the first sentence sow seeds indoors and flats trays or small pots six to eight weeks before transplanting uh sprinkle two to three seeds in each pot do not cover do not cover the seed oh so you're not supposed to cover them see i think that's what my problem was when i was growing out my mint when i was growing mint the mint plants i mean the mint seeds and the strawberry seeds they were the same size as these they were like hella tiny like tiny tiny and what i did with those was i sprinkled it and then i sprinkled some soil on top of it and they never germinated so i think these are the type of seeds that you just sprinkle on the top soil and let them germinate from there so i'm gonna just take a mental note of that but yeah this is gonna be the new project right here y'all virginia gold tobacco yes sir chill and also in addition to the kale i want to show y'all the sunflowers look how big they got such a short time let me just get one out i'll get this one right here yes the sunflower is getting hella furry on the bottom that [ __ ] looks tight right there it's getting fur on the bottom all right just want to show y'all the sunflowers and i'm gonna show you the georgia southern collard green now don't worry about these spots right here it's just like water droplets still drying up i spray down my plants every day so they're used to it and this one is also uh forming a biofilm similar to the cave they both got that bio film let me touch it you see it's all natural it's all natural like hormone that the plants create when they're in a a good environment a good soil it creates this sheet this coating on the leaf an organic coating it might look like a pesticide spray but it's indeed organic it's something that the plant itself created you know i'm saying and it's a natural like pest preventative if this was growing outside then pests they don't really like the powdery coating on it so they'll leave it alone but yeah i just wanted to show you all the updates this is my tobacco all that is just like leaves it's just leaves and [ __ ] i don't actually have any plants that sprouted yet but yeah tobacco i was thinking about getting another four by four tent but that's just like a little bit too much right now i might just have two small um like i'm gonna have two of these little small mini tents you feel me for the vegetables i already got one light for one of them i gotta probably get another light this paycheck coming up so we'll see your boy las vegas nights we out peace so this is my favorite part about growing kale is a mini harvest i'm saying i'm gonna get this back leaf right here because it's just about ready to go nice nice even cut right there and boom that's the back of the leaf 100 organic this is the front of the leaf look at all them veins and bon appetit that's how real g do it fresh off the plant no washing gone look at the sun coming up got to get another one for the vegetable room for sure all right y'all so i finally came home from lowe's fresh from lowe's um so this is my current timer that i have right now but this led is a three prong led meaning let me show you real quick it's a three pronged just like this this isn't the light but that's one of the fans so this one is only two prongs so i needed a three prong that i got from lowe's booyah i also got some uh gorilla gorilla glue i got some gorilla glue hold up i just noticed that i got some uh gorilla glue for this show number four but now i got some gorilla glue because you can never have enough uh gorilla glue this [ __ ] is like 10 times better than regular super glue so i had to get some of that and also i got oh also i got this right here i got these i mean i got a five pack of uh titanium edge blades titanium edge blades these was like the premium ones so they costed a couple dollars more but i needed uh some more blades for my current blade because this is my last one um this is the blade that i use well not a blade but this is the knife this knife right here this is the knife that i use for work i used to use my blade fork but it was dulling out my blades too much and i was buying packs i was going through packs so i just decided to use my knife sharpener and just sharpen this one every time it gets dull and this is my [ __ ] hits the fan blade so every time i'm in pl uh public sorry about that y'all i got these chapped ass lips and [ __ ] i gotta lick my lip i gotta i gotta eat bro it's like every time like if i'm really really really hungry my lips start getting chapped and [ __ ] and i don't know it's weird but um yeah so this one right here is my [ __ ] hits the fan blade this is going to be the blade that i like i'm never going to use this tip unless i have to use it so i want to always keep this tip this edge sharp you feel me so this is the one i use in public and this is the one is if a [ __ ] run up on me boom there it is um but yeah man speaking of chapped lips y'all know like that [ __ ] just popped in my head chap lippmann whoever watched uh cause i'm a i'm an 80s baby but grew up in the 90s whoever watched doug uh dug on nickelodeon y'all remember doug doug funny with skeeter valentine i know everybody's name bro i used to that used to be one of my favorite shows bro on me one of my favorite people on there was bb bb valentine i mean was that her name nah bibi bluff yeah bb bluff she was so conceited bro that [ __ ] was funny but um if y'all remember doug funny um it was a band on doug called the beats and then one of the band members his name was chap lippman and actually just popped in my head when i was talking about chat blips like it's funny how they use names different names in uh cartoons like they use names that's funny as [ __ ] but kids don't even recognize it until they're grown like chap lippmann just think of that chaplin it sounds like some british [ __ ] but it's funny though all right i'm talking out here off i'm gonna plug this into the wall get my time right i'm gonna have my vegetables on the same timer as my flowers and that's gonna be off from 1 p.m to 7 p.m and what time is it right now it's 11 47 so i got plenty time to sit here and just dwell in all my hard work and just sit here and smile at all my plans all right charlie boy lost vegas nice out peace what up y'all it's thursday september 24th at 4 50 in the morning as you can see we grubbing on somewhat breakfast but uh there's a lot i gotta do today um i gotta choose which sunflowers i'm gonna keep and which collard greens i'm gonna keep and which ones i'm gonna toss because um as you can see we got our new grow light set up and this is gonna be our veg tent right here it's not going to be i don't need nothing too big i don't want to go overboard it's just i'm just one man you feel me so this would be the last tent besides the mail tent that i'll use and it's not even big it's just one of the little smaller ones i'm six foot this is about four feet so it's only room for i measured it out there's only room for about six of these uh two gallon pots so i'm gonna put three in the back three in the front as you can see my kale i had to push it all the way to the back and raise the leaves up because uh lack of space but since i'm growing in a two gallon pot they shouldn't get too big you know what i'm saying so i'm gonna go ahead and transplant right now so these are the five i'm gonna keep right here and unfortunately i gotta get rid of these two i'm so sad because there's nothing wrong with them there's nothing wrong and also i'm gonna get rid of these wildflowers because they're attracting a lot of gnats like i notice there's a lot of that activity around these wildflowers so i'ma use their purpose it's finally come up so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna use all of them and just grind them up and grind up some earthworm castings some mulch and some some other soil that i got plus this soil that's in there i'm gonna just grind all that up and i'm gonna use that add it with some other [ __ ] probably some nitrogen and transplant these into their two gallon homes these are my um that's tobacco but nothing's came up yet all that is on the top is just like compost so as y'all can see i put a whole bunch of napkins around my plants i've been doing a lot of research and they say is a good and a bad thing to use napkins on your plants they say is a good thing to protect all the beneficial bacteria but it's a bad thing because it absorbs the nitrogen like it robs the nitrogen from the soil so i'll see um how this goes i might have to give them a slight nitrogen boost just before flower just to make sure that the nitrogen levels are a1 imma keep my eyes on all the leaves and make sure they stay green all right y'all i'm a transplant it's 450 and when it's all done y'all gonna be like wow just wait and see so this was my old kale tent that was shut down for a couple months because there was no activity going on but i repurposed it because i had these two bulbs in there but as you can see i purchased this led online on ebay a thousand watt led and that's my exhaust fan right there got the exhaust outs right here that's my intake fan i'm gonna tie this down to the wall this cord and also that these lights over here already have the if you can see it already has the red spectrum it already has the red spectrum in there but this light gives you the choice of using the white spectrum or clicking that so let's see white spectrum you put that in the red spectrum so that's pretty neat i'm gonna just keep it right here because uh it looks like my plants are liking that a little better they might grow a little bit more with the white because they are just green leafy plants so they might not need that but i am growing sunflowers so they might need that red spectrum um [Music] temperature 81 it's pretty hot right here bro i ain't even gonna lie like my hand is right here i wouldn't let my plants grow any more than probably right here so i don't know i might have to get another tent because it is kind of hot right here it's like baking hot so we'll see let me transplant i'll be right back i want to show y'all the sunflowers roots this is the sunflowers root ball right here looking down there looking down there like a weed root ball right there oh look at her oh [ __ ] down yeah she used i'm gonna put some great white on her and throw her in her new home yeah let's do it they didn't reach maturity as you can see it's no season boy we finish swag out the dough boy mr polo swag from the swag a new day hot damn it's a new day red polo horseman red polo cologne black polo horseman here what up youtube it's 8 40 am and i'm finally done finally done transplanting my sunflowers putting up my scrog tent amending soil and all the hard work is done you know what i'm saying it's smooth sailing from here for the next eight weeks if nothing [ __ ] us up that is you know i'm saying but let me show y'all the progress ah yes after all that hard work we finally got product right here young sam september 24th they will be put in the flower august first well that's when i'll switch the lights anyway um so first signs of flower it should be anywhere between like october 4th through the 7th you know i'm saying once i flip them lights but we still got a full week left to get them nice and trained hopefully they reach this scrub so i could weave them in it might be a little bit too tall i might have to lower it down just a little bit i just want to see how they're going to grow this next week you know what i'm saying before i lower it or raise it for sure for sure um i'm only going to do one scrog this time i'm not gonna do two so i don't think it's necessary um but let's get into the flowers real quick i know y'all keep seeing the napkins like i say before i was doing some research and they said the carbon from like paper and tree products and things of that nature will enrich the soil and it's kind of like carbohydrates for humans i'm saying even though carbs is not really like a good you know source of food carbs that give you energy you know i'm saying and that's the same with this uh tissue and i'm saying this tissue for the plants is the equivalency of ramen noodles for us it's not good for us per se but it'll keep us full you know i'm saying and give us energy or whatever that means so what i mean by that is um too much can uh take away too much nitrogen from your plants see i'm saying so it's an experiment you know i'm saying yolo you only live once and i haven't seen not one other youtube grower do the paper towel method so i'm gonna just try this if i see that the napkins are absorbing too much nitrogen from the plants and the plants start to turn too yellow then i'll just take off i'll just simply take all the paper out you know i'm saying it's easy to take out so all you got to do is wait till it dries and just take it out anyway and i didn't use newspaper because uh it has ink on it and i'm trying to do an organic run i don't need no ink in my soil so with that being said let's get into them all right so right here we got a gorilla glue fino number three looking marvelous i topped them like three different times so they got stupid tops on them right now look at all these tops and i also lst i lst my plants if you could see this these uh they call it a floral wire that's what it's called and it just helps you train your plants better make it a more wider even plant and that's exactly what i want because since i lst'd all the light can now get to some of this growth that wouldn't have otherwise got light you heard let's move on this one right here pineapple express auto this is a auto now so i didn't know that and so i looked online and indeed this is from barney's farm it's growing exactly like an identical version of my other pineapple express styles right here as you can see the y the big ass y because i trained my plants just right really this is supposed to be another why but i don't know why it's not a why hold up i know why we gotta just pull these wires a little bit more boom there we go now we're a perfect wide and that's why let's move on this one right here is a gorilla glue fino number one this is our all-star prize possession right here as you can see that's her top right there damn near about to touch the scrub i'll say in a couple more days of just straight stretching um it's hard to see one plant from the other but all this is one gorilla glue the one back there is its own and let's get in here go this way healthy growth healthy healthy growth can't complain this is the main leading stem so i definitely gotta scrog that one up once it reaches the top because it's looking like it wants to reach for the stars right now let's move on this one right here is my new york city diesel round number one or fino one it's more of a short indica but her leaves are way more darker than the gorilla glues leaves i think partly because it's so short and gorilla glue is just so so bushy and this is another reason why i chose this fino to grow out the majority of gorilla glue because like i said the fino that i got these seeds from was a tough grower and as i could see all her offspring are growing exactly like their mother and let's move on again nyc diesel v01 let's get into that again all of my plants are lst just right as you can see and her tops are coming in wonderful my plan is i might do one more lollipop before i throw them in the flower i don't know if i'm gonna do another uh topping because it's already too much tops as it is so i might just do a quick little trim up on the bottom get some of this bottom growth unwanted bottom growth like uh this one right here this one will just never see the light of day so it needs to go because it's robbing energy from these top these top shoots up here so like this one could go maybe even those two who knows we'll see let's move on i'm gonna open this side so we can get to those back plants oh [ __ ] my phone didn't touch the sticky trap a lot of work has went into this specific girl right here y'all so please please give las vegas knights a round of applause let me just applause myself yeah i'm saying please like share subscribe your boy has reached that super saiyan level of growing i feel like goku let's move on to this one right here this is a hairy lemon the only one of his kind so no need to say fino whatever yes hairy lemon lemon lemon i'm gonna have to look up harry lemon i don't know what that's crossed with i know it got some kind of lemon in it but i'm not exactly sure but indeed she's looking just right i might clone i'm not sure if i'll clone this round or not maybe i really don't like cloning i'd rather grow from seed but who knows let's move on to this one right here um that is gorilla glue final number four right there so again they're growing just right they're looking so well they look like synthetically grown plants like you know when you grow when you use synthetic nutrients it makes your plants look all oh fake they look so [ __ ] real that they look fake you know what i'm saying that's how well they be grown when they synthetic but my [ __ ] is growing just the same way only difference is organics chia so all this is the same plant from where my hand is all this is the same plant this is gonna be a nice vino to clone if i were to clone this one right here is growing more like a tree this one's growing more like a bush see this one has dummy tops this is gorilla glue fino number i don't even know what you know this is but we got to figure it out for the camera this is female number two that's phenom number two again i'm doing all this stretching and all this for y'all youtube you already know las vegas nice didn't have nearly this much result as i do now from the last run like i said i threw them straight in the flower and that was all she wrote um oh yeah did we even really get into the pineapple express like that let me see let me just show y'all real quick again she's in flower uh i think this is either the beginning of the second week or late first week um since it's a auto i will be keeping it in here with the vegging plants because i just don't have anywhere else to put it right now where it could just be in darkness with with a lot of air circulation you feel me so since their autos they should be alright i heard autos could grow in veg light or flower light so they're only going to be here in a veg light for another week let's move on to tent too y'all tent one is a wrap scrog looking nice nice and tight everything's looking neat let's just look let's let's glance at this room before we move on to tent number two just look at this look at that nothing's going wrong i know a lot of y'all growers out there are gonna take las vegas nights yeah i'm saying method as far as the napkins because a lot of benefits with the napkins the napkins for one is covering up so nats can't get into the soil even though i got air pots so they could get to the sides through the hose but they can't lay eggs on the top that's what's up right there i know y'all growers gonna take my uh my little trick but if y'all do take this and y'all do post it please please name las vegas knights who recommended you to do it don't just take it and run with it and act like it was your idea because we all know las vegas knights always coming up with something new let's move on to tent two boom and there go tent two y'all whoop daddy we're gonna try to do all this in one tape you heard so this is tent two not as much action going on as tent one but we still got a couple plants trying to get there like this one right here gorilla gluffino another one it's crazy because every plant that i got in the same spot is the last grow they're growing exactly like that plant the plant that i had here was a chocolate mint og it grew real bushy like this the two plants i had right there were cub scout they were growing like they had the y's you know what i'm saying and i got the y going on with that one and this gorilla glue so we got it popping right now y'all let's get in here oh yeah before we get into here i forgot to show you all the cactus all right i know i keep going back and forth but i knew it was something i forgot in here so my cactuses are both happier than ever and let's move on oh yeah and that's another benefit of the napkins the napkins in addition to covering up the topsoil so nats can't get in there is also keeping the soil nice and moist and warm and snug it's kind of like a blanket you know what i'm saying so the soil doesn't dry out you know i'm saying the microorganisms that's in the soil they could thrive because they usually do better in darkness than with the light so all that covering the soil you're gonna probably see an explosion of growth who knows we'll find out let's move on this right here is the candy kush these two plants right here i thought they weren't gonna be [ __ ] i was i was about to toss this afghan kush right here this afghan kush it's the same age as this gorilla glue but it just the growth is just so stunning on it and the growth is so stunning that i had to uh lst this but the way how i lst did was i pulled i pulled the main stem and it's so tight right now it's so tight the main stem i pulled it all the way down to the side and now we got growth coming from this way because it's pulled this way so now we got growth this way too so we just transform this plant y'all look at that afghan kush next we got a candy kush again we did the same well we didn't do the same thing with this one what we did with this one was we just pulled each leading branch to the side so we could get more growth in the middle candy kush oh yeah and by the way y'all the gnats is not liking these napkins every five minutes i see different that's just running around the napkins trying to get up in there but they can't find the entrance it's funny next we got pineapple express pheno2 this one is doing way better than uh fino one as far as the growth is going but it's just so stringy and straggly i don't even know how much weight i'm gonna get i don't even expect to get a lot out of this pineapple right here i'm saying i don't even plan on getting a lot of weight out of this hopefully i do she's the same age as the other pineapple same age but this one has let's count one two three four five six seven eight nine nine tops gucci let's move on this is a gorilla glue fino number five i have a total of i think i have a total of seven different gorilla glufinos and as y'all can see each one is growing way differently from the other one this one looks like a straight bonsai tree right here i'm saying compared to the ones in room one and this one i'm not even gonna lie this one is probably my favorite one by how it looks just look at it look at the bottom and then look at the top that's just amazing right there y'all so again this is fino five and they smell it smells like so much coffee in here you would have swore i was a starbucks i mean my god it smells like diesel coffee straight up it's making me hungry right now matter of fact after this i'm going to take a shower and go to the stove real quick give me some heat next we got a nyc diesel pheno2 y'all saw phenol one in the last tent this is fino two all right and let's move on to the last three back there let's check the temps in this room 76 awesome 77 and 10 1. great all right we'll start over here this is gorilla glue fino six and more than likely this is pheno7 so that's six right there this one right here is number seven gorilla glue final number seven and for all the newbies in here that's new to growing and y'all wondering like what is what is afino what does fino mean just imagine just imagine a woman that has a lot of kids like just imagine your brothers and sisters some people's kids don't look like them some people's kids do look like them um some people have foster kids some people have step children but that's exactly what it is afino is a different child a different type of child you might have one black child one white child one asian child one mexican child that's pheno1 pheno2 pheno3 and pheno4 they are all different they're all the same because they're children but they're different types of children so those are different types of phenos for all my newbies that didn't know what a female was because i didn't know what a fino was when i first started growing i just kept hearing people say fino three and even google then didn't give me a direct answer i had to really go on like 420 forms and [ __ ] to see what fino meant and again this one is our unknown backseat well not backseat but this is one of our unknown genetics but we'll figure out which one it is um by how it grows and we'll compare it to the other ones all right so we got tent one done ten two done and let's move on to the vegetable tin all in one take y'all and there's our vegetable garden boom i always said i wanted i always wanted my own indoor vegetable garden where i can go in pick my vegetables that i might need in a [ __ ] his defense scenario and be able to sustain myself you feel me with that being said let's check the temps in here it's 80 in here it's not a lot of air flow because i got smaller fans in this tent than the other tent because this is a smaller tent um it's probably that hot because uh this led is brand new but it's kind of hot let me switch it to the white light so you can see these veggies a little better all right let's get in here to matter of fact i got my ruler uh [ __ ] let me get i'm gonna get my ruler real quick i wanna i didn't left my ruler hold on let me just put this i told you i want to get this in one tape i don't want to make a whole bunch of clips for this i'm trying to just hold this right here i'll be right back y'all all right i just wanted to get my ruler out because i want to measure some of these kale leaves these kale leaves are getting so big that i need to start measuring them hold on i need to wipe this off real quick yo hold on all right there we go damn this is a half hour clip damn there oh well it needs to be done as you can see this leaf right here if i were to pull it out is curled up but if i were to pull it out more than likely that'll be a six inch leaf right there this one saying about six inches the plant itself is i know it's over a hundred days old but uh let's see the plant itself is a foot tall all right so this is my blue scotch curled kale right here they call it blue scotch because when it starts maturing it turns blue it has like a bluish tint to it you can see it right there it's like blue bluish i had to stand up the leaf so she can get more light penetration action this one right here is one of my sunspot dwarf sunflowers ever since transplant it looks like she's loving it sunflower plants are funny because they they get hella hairy on the bottom that [ __ ] looks funny you see all that hair well let me show you you see all that hair right there i want to get a good shot of this hair here hold on there we go you see how hairy they're getting again hairy [ __ ] this is one of my georgia southern collard greens um one of the leaves broke off of this while i was transplanting and i ate it and the sweetness on this omg these are more bitter when you eat them but these are so sweet bro these are so good and tasty home oh my gosh georgia southern college green there's another georgia southern collard green so you might as well say fino one and two my sunspot dwarf sunflower fino one two and three this one let's get into it their leaves are curled down for one because uh they're usually perked up but like i said i just transplanted them and some of their leaves are kind of like wrinkled or droopy they're usually perked up but uh you learn a lot from your plants while they're growing and that's one thing i learned is when you transplant them they do not some plants do not like transplants they just go in the complete like shock bro they just start shriveling up and [ __ ] but if they make it through the first couple hours then they'll make it they'll survive if not i then had a plant that i transplanted and it just kept shriveling up to the point where it was nothing plants can do that all right and this is my thousand watt led that i got on ebay for about um what was it they wanted what did they want they wanted sixty dollars for it they said sixty dollars or best offer so i hustled them down to fifty with free shipping so you can't beat a good deal and that's about it y'all that's my exhaust fan my intake fan and all this room needs now is a sticky fly all right y'all your boy las vegas knights we doing big things doing big things like comment subscribe and stay tuned because we ain't going nowhere hopefully peace you", "gsUerLrdaXo": "[Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] you", "PIp1NxzxFck": "hey everyone shawn from grayscale gorilla here in today's quick start i'm going to show you how we can get the most out of our new car paint materials after you've installed these guys through the grayscale gorilla hub go ahead and fire up the plus library and you will see that they auto magically load and of course we have them for arnold octane and redshift and i'm going to just dock this guy into my ui here and let's drag this first one blueprint blue right onto our body components i've isolated here on this corvette model which you can snag off of cg trader like i did and if i just fire up the interactive renderer you should see here in a second what we get a lovely car paint material out of the box looks awesome this dark emerald is definitely one of my favorites i also like this crazy green looks pretty sweet on this corvette and one of the benefits of the way we've set these up is that you have full control over the colors flakes clear coat all the parameters you can get in here and play around with so if i dive into this closer camera i've set up we can get a better look at these flakes now one important parameter of the flakes is the scale so we've gone ahead and set up a couple custom nodes for the scale of the flakes to give more precise control right now this has a value of 0.251 and i can crank up the size a little more here so you can better see what's going on these flakes are much larger than you'd want for realism but this gives us a better idea of some of the control we get when we dive in to the actual shader here and you can see here we have a nice density parameter if i drop this down to zero we have no flakes if i crank it up to 0.47 we have a lot of flakes another parameter to play around with is the normal randomize and this guy here kind of controls like the virtual angle of the flakes you could think of if it's at zero they're gonna feel very flat and if it's cranked up here they're gonna feel all over the place and extra sparkly if i hop out of the close camera here we can see what we're getting here if you want to go for that kind of a look extra sparkly you can get in here and play with all these parameters to your heart's content including the colors of course if we want to switch this to more of a teal blue we can easily do that you can see that each car paint is made up of several colors and here we go this looks pretty cool and if i go back into that flake scale here i'll definitely want to put this down to more realistic value something like .25 and of course this is dependent on the size of your car in 3d space so if you bring in a much larger vehicle or something that's not correctly set to scale the flakes are not quite gonna be set up correctly so by default they're set up to real-world scale so that's another thing you just want to keep an eye on make sure your car models are set up at the correct scale but yeah i'm going to turn on this other hdri and this actually turned out really nice this blue if i hop back into the plus library we have a couple other really fun ones specifically these camo wraps turned out really cool love these guys snow camo this one's awesome that's just a quick look at some of the new car paints and we cannot wait to see what you all create with these thanks again"}
