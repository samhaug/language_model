The year is 2021, and though the rollout of\n5g technology has been slow, your town finally got all the fancy new antennas and cell phone\ntowers installed that will make it possible for phones to connect to the 5g network. Excited to try out lightning fast internet\nanywhere you go, you pull out your phone and hop on youtube to watch another episode of\nyour favorite informative online show. But as your phone connects to the 5g network,\nyour nose suddenly starts bleeding. Your hands shake and your vision gets blurry,\nthen suddenly, your head pops like an overripe melon or that one scene from scanners. You're dead now, and it's all because you\njust had to have 5g cell service on your phone. Clearly, the previous scenario is hyperbole,\nbut as 5g technology comes closer to being an international reality, people all across\nthe world are having some very real fears about what this new tech will do to the human\nbody. First though, what is 5g, and how is it going\nto change the way we communicate? 5g is the latest development in wireless information\ntransfer technology. The G in 5g stands for generation, so this\nis the fifth generation of cellular technology, which is impressive since the tech has only\nreally been about a few decades. 5G is poised to change humanity in a very\nbig way, and in fact may be the single biggest redvolution in human culture since the global\nadoption of the internet. That's because 5g technology will allow information\ntransfer rates as high as a stunning twenty gigabytes per second, which is faster than\nmost wired connections. More bandwidth and improved antenna technology\nwill make it possible to share more data, faster, anywhere within network coverage. We could see latency drop to as low as 1 millisecond,\nmeaning that for the first time wireless augmented reality technology could become a real thing. This means that you could play virtual reality\ngames anywhere that you have coverage, but it would also allow for things like remote\nsurgery in more places. The military is already looking to applications\nof 5g technology, and dream of a heads-up display system that would let soldiers share\nreal-time data across the battlefield, or let ground combat drone operators to control\nbattlefield robots alongside human soldiers in real time. Needless to say, the ability to stream so\nmuch data so quickly anywhere with coverage could be revolutionary. 5g works differently from 4g by replacing\nlarge, high power cell towers with many more cell stations spread out across a city. This is one disadvantage of 5g tech, in testing\nusers reported dropping out of service when more than two blocks away from a tower, so\ntelecommunications companies are going to have to invest heftily into outfitting each\ncity with thousands of new antennas. Luckily, these antennas are far smaller than\nnormal cell phone towers, and can be inconspicuously worked into light poles or the roofs of buildings. The reason for the change from large, powerful\ncell towers to a swarm of smaller antennas is because 5g operates at a much higher frequency\nthan 4g coverage, operating between 30 and 300 gigahertz. This means that the electromagnetic waves\n5g uses for communications are much smaller than those used for regular cell service,\nand are thus much more prone to interference and have far shorter ranges. Right now companies in the US, Japan, South\nKorea and China are building the first 5g networks, and its estimated that a full rollout\nof the technology will cost billions of dollars and take until well into the 2030s. However the benefits far outweigh the steep\nprice, or even the wait, and 5g promises to make a truly interconnected world a reality. But with every new technology, comes fear\nfrom the public sector, and now some people are opposing the rollout of 5g technology\non the grounds that it is dangerous to human health. The reason for the fear behind 5g largely\ncomes from the very high frequencies that the technology uses to transmit data. 5G operates at the same frequency that microwaves\ndo, and sadly a general lack of scientific knowledge has led many people around the world\nto fear that 5g could literally cook your brain. As many scientists have pointed out though,\nit's not the wavelength that makes microwaves cook food so effectively, but the power that\nthe microwave puts out. The average microwave puts out 700 watts of\npower, while a cell phone barely puts out a single watt. Further, microwaves concentrate all of that\nenergy into a very confined space, while your cell phone spits out its energy all over the\nenvironment. A woman in New Zealand made headlines after\nstarting an online petition to ban the rollout of 5g technology, fearful of the effects the\nnetwork would have on the human body. As is so often the case, the woman first grew\nconcerned when she read a Facebook post about the dangers of 5g technology, and since Facebook\nis world-renowned as a trusted, peer-reviewed authority on all scientific matters, she immediately\nlaunched an online petition asking her local government to stop the rollout of 5g technology\nin her city. According to the woman, she feared what the\neffects of 5g exposure 24 hours a day would do to the human body. She is hardly alone however in fearing the\nrollout of 5g technology, and in April of this year a test rollout was halted in Brussels,\nBelgium, after citizens became concerned over the extra \u201cradiation\u201d in the environment. This forced local government to enact anti-radiation\nlaws, which we wish them good luck in enforcing as we are literally bathed in electromagnetic\nradiation every day. In fact we have bad news for Brussels, because\nevery time their citizens enjoy a sunny day they are being blasted by electromagnetic\nradiation. Time to ban the sun, Belgium, except don't\nthink hiding indoors will save you because those light bulbs in your home? Bam- basically drowning you in electromagnetic\nradiation. The culprit here is as so often is an ignorance\nof science and scientific terms. Radiation is used to describe every single\nelectromagnetic emission in the universe, and these include everything from the sun's\nwarm light to your light bulb, or the waves that carry your favorite radio station tunes\nto your car's radio. The difference between benign and harmful\nradiation is whether it is ionizing or not, that is whether it is strong enough to remove\nelectrons from their orbit around an atom, thus causing the atom to become charged, or\nionized. The split between ionizing and non-ionizing\nradiation occurs in the Ultraviolet range, and rest assured, 5g technology falls far\nshort of this point. Now non-ionizing radiation can still be dangerous,\nas it can still generate heat and thus destroy living tissue. But once more we have to consider the power\nthat the radiation is transmitted at, and as we mentioned before, your cell phone simply\ndoesn't have the oomph to hurt you or your neighbors. For fun we looked at some of the more popular\nconspiracy theories surrounding 5G technology, because on the internet ignorance is in no\nshort supply. One of our favorites was that 5G technology\nwas being used as a form of global population control, which we assume means that all previous\nmethods attempted were complete failures. Everything from GMO crops to vaccines to chemtrails\nto dog farts have been claimed by conspiracy theorists at some point or another as being\nforms of population control, and yet humanity continues growing despite our apparent best\nefforts to prevent this. Either this means that these conspiracy theories\nare nonsense, or the government is really, really bad at its job. Another favorite theory is the autism theory,\nbecause apparently blaming the mercury in vaccines for causing autism is slowly going\nout of style, so it's time to blame cell phones. First of all, the original mercury used in\nvaccines never caused autism because the dose was so small and the body couldn't physically\nabsorb it, and the new version of mercury they use now is even less harmful. Plus, you can always get a mercury-free vaccine\nif you happen to be scared of nonsense. But cell phones causing autism? Well, we're not quite sure how that's supposed\nto work as the EM waves given off by radiation are so weak and scientists have confirmed\nthat electromagnetic radiation is at least 99% free of mercury. Another theory put forth is that 5g technology\nuses high frequency waves that are capable of boiling water, and thus this is going to\nbe used to make everyone on earth sterile. This theory is of course half-right, as yes,\n5g technology uses the same high frequency waves your microwave puts out, but as we've\nmentioned twice now and really can't stress enough- it's not just frequency you have to\nworry about, but power output. Besides, we have it on good authority that\nthe Zeta Reticuli reptilians who secretly rule the government have no interest in turning\nhumanity sterile, as it would dramatically lower their delicious human brain supply. Also we're not sure how boiling the water\nin the human body would make you sterile. If this were possible it would just make you\ndead, which on second thought, we have to admit is a pretty good way of making people\nstop having babies. It's clear some people are fearful of 5G technology,\nin no small part thanks to a general ignorance of science and the fear associated with the\nword radiation. The best cure for this fear is to get informed,\njust like you've just been- although you are a pretty smart cookie, you subscribe to The\nInfographics Show after all.

they'll kind of claim that you're getting it all for less and rarely is that actually true but with the galaxy s20 fan edition it it kind of feels that way you're giving up so little and in some cases actually improving certain specifications except you're saving a bunch of money from the regular flagship device it's hard to even call it mid-range because it's got a snapdragon 865 in it it has almost an identical spec list to the regular flagship s20 and it's almost half the cost when they first announced it they were saying okay it's gonna be 6.99 like a day later i'm seeing amazon other places were already dropping another 100 from it right now you can find this for 5.99 which really the snapdragon 865 and galaxy s20 internals it seems kind of hard to even buy a regular s20 right now my understanding is that the materials are a little bit different in the construction here is the device actually you know what but it has see it has that plastic back now i was a little critical of this matte finish plastic back on the note series devices however those were far more expensive you weren't catching much of a deal on those phones here on the other hand now that we're down to this price point it's something i think i can accept now i kind of like this color as well you know you get this darkish blueish it almost reminds me of uh willy blue that's willy doo's midnight blue version of the later case it's a similar tone to it now you are going to lose a couple of capabilities in the camera department you're not going to shoot 8k video you're not going to have any type you're going to have 100 times space zoom but you are going to have telephoto functionality and you're going to have the important stuff you would come to expect inside of an s20 smartphone just for less money we have our volume rocker over here as well as the power switch camera module in the back it's not even a huge hump bottom of the device you have your usb type c port as well as a speaker top of the device showcases your sim card tray also capable of expandable storage so a little versatility up to one terabyte there's a giant protector on the screen that baby's gonna get removed too you can see you still get the tiny little hole punch infinity o style front-facing camera yes it's gonna have an oled display amoled like the rest of the lineup but when compared to the standard s20 it's a slightly lower pixel density one advantage this even has over the regular s20 which is at a higher price point this has a bigger battery so this is a 500 milliamp hour battery compared to a 4 000 milliamp hour battery kind of a no frills on boxing we do have an adaptive fast charge power brick and we have a type c cable to get it all connected and that's pretty much it look it's the fan edition oh there is a little box on the top with a sim card tool but i think that's it i don't think there's a case or anything else no that's it no frills now i've been uh really adjusting to the samsung interface to the one ui for a while now i was on the s20 ultra and i switched to a oneplus device for a while the most recent note series the ultra model my sim card is currently inside of the z fold too oh and also you may have thought they could have skimped on the refresh rate since you're getting a better deal but this display actually supports 120 hertz let's go take a look standard wood put it at 60 hertz for presumably slightly better battery life and high moves you up to the 120 hertz scroll rate which if you haven't experienced it before you may have heard me talk about it before this is uh it really enhances your experience with the device when you pair it with something like a snapdragon 865 it just creates a very fluid experience in the os moving through menus and so on now they're not created completely equal you're giving up a little bit of ram and that might be the most significant drawback going with the fan edition versus the flagship level s20 you are dropping down from 12 gigs or 8 gigs of ram depending on which version you you would choose to six gigs of ram in this model right here and as you can see i mean that's a tiny little hole punch on video especially for look at it there even against a light backdrop it is a tiny little hole punch against the dark black drop you hardly see it so that's a nice implementation if i go ahead and boost the volume let's see what we're working with a request by pigeon oh carrier pigeon the old-school one yeah they're still in the playstation controller it's firing out of both locations from the bottom region and up around the earpiece which is hardly even there so that's kind of nice is that the screen type of setup it's buried in there controller will travis scott but it does give you uh it's a pretty nice i don't think they skimped on it too much i'm i'm satisfied i'm okay with that if i launch into the camera you can see i still have camera versatility i don't have the same reach on the zoom but how often were you using that this is your standard focal range photo bang and we move into the zoom a 3x now there's other settings for the hybrid zoom and all that up to 30x but let's use the 3x for the purpose of this and we can go all the way back to 0.5 for the ultra wide i think it's enough versatility for the average person plus these s20 devices have been great performers in the camera department and they've seen continued improvements through software now if i switch over to the selfie camera i can go ahead and do a little selfie test real quick i just got to turn off the beauty i need the original i can't be having the beauty mode on there as you know beard hair test it passes we have plenty of resolution what is the resolution it's a 32 megapixel front-facing camera interestingly enough that's more megapixels than the standard s20 you got to go all the way to the ultra model to beat that with a 40 megapixel shooter that's kind of i mean there this is a weird phone it's hard to figure out it has a bigger screen than the regular s20 it has a bigger battery than the regular s20 it's almost half the price of the regular s20 i get it it's plastic but i feel like i can live with that when i get the cost savings i was mad about it with the note as you know but when i get the cost savings i think i can live with it face recognition and fingerprints now it's an optical based face unlock system well i've tricked some of these in the past but tremendous speed i'm going to go ahead and register my fingerprint the fingerprint is added we'll give it a quick test yes functions as expected in display's gotten a lot better it's kind of funny to see some manufacturers going back to the capacitive rear scanner like the new pixel devices that we saw today there's a rumor that the upcoming apple devices could potentially have fingerprint back touch id in the power button so many different implementations one of the advantages of being in display you can use it even when it's on the table you see that may or may not be important to you snapdragon 865 it means tremendous prowess when it comes to processor intensive tasks including gaming so i'ma go ahead and launch a game real quick and just showcase what this thing's capable of i know a lot of people out there they want the top level chip but they don't want paid the top level money you don't want to pay a thousand dollars for a smartphone that's reasonable here's a way you can do it look at this i'm fine with the layup i'm fine i'll take the two points all right cool so yes of course you can game on it whatever games your style whether it's uh basketball or you want to do a shoot or something like that plus more and more games are supporting the fast refresh and i talked about this in recent videos having that 120 once you see a game at it or even 90 or something above 60 it has this extra twitchiness to it which uh can really enhance the experience wow what a device i mean what can you say it's an s20 sort of rehoused and trimmed back a little bit but then also improved in other areas if you want a big battery performer forty five hundred millimeter you want a flagship chip you don't just because you're spending a little less money doesn't mean you don't want a snapdragon 865 okay it's in there you want galaxy s20 caliber cameras oh yeah that's in there as well you want the versatility of expandable storage that's in there as well you got fast charging it's in there yeah you got to put up with the plastic chassis okay fine you saved a bunch of money this one you pop this out the pocket and your pal has the regular s20 i believe willy do's using it right now and he's sitting there saying you got the plastic phone you say yeah i got the plastic phone but i got a spare 500 bucks you don't then you pull the 500 bucks out of your pocket and willy dude is very upset so look if you got to trim it back you trim it back but you pass the savings on to the customer and they definitely did that here and it's probably why they call it the fan edition well done samsung i mean like i said look you got five six seven hundred dollars to spend on a smartphone right now

field for more than 25 years globally and my experience is especially at nokia for about 15 years and 10 years at huawei technologies and i'm currently serving as cto and cso uh at huawei within the asia-pacific region as well as i'm contributing to the 5g imda taskforce as chairman and i'm also continuing say my work as an academic at a university of new south wales as a junk professor now i'd like to start from uh introducing you um where we are today with 5g and this figure um it is about the current assigned spectrum for 5g and the live networks and 5g launches as you see here we have more than 28 separators that have received spectrum in the three bands so namely the low band below one gears we banned normally around 3.5 gigahertz and then a high band which is above six kilos particularly i'm thinking of the millimeter wave at 26 28 and so forth guys most allocations uh spin on the mid band now as we speak we have uh many operators that have already launched 5g uh that has happened also here in australia and uh we have more than 110 operators that have planned to launch those services equally equally interesting it is the number of connections already in place and at global scale so as you see here this report from the usma and gsa which have consolidated in a single slide shows that at the end of last year we had already more than 200 millions connections and expectations to achieve about the quarter of the planet connected namely 1.8 billion connections by 2025. if you look into the details uh you see here most of the connections connection coming from china so we have 202 millions out of 234 millions in china and if we look at the uh 2025 we have more than 800 millions out on 1.8 billions equally in china here you may see also the uh operator carpex uh within the yeah within the range 2020 2025 so it is uh an investment of more than 200 billion in china of course it's not just 5g happening in china so if you look at the adoption expected by 2025 we have that the most redemption um same percentage would be north america followed by uh europe and then of course this specific region now looking at the announced 5g devices by form factor today we have that we have already available commercially more than 274 74 smartphones so 3 spent of choice we have 100 a fixed sap for fixed virus access in other form factors such as a industrial enterprise routers with the connectivity to 5g tablets hotspot and the possibility of implanting models on other type of platforms such as drones vehicle robotic platform and so forth and here you may see the representation of a pie chart where most of the devices available are a smartphone followed by the cp for fixed virus access when we talk about the 5g and 6g 6g and the and how the um the technology will evolve we may refer to the 5g technology roadmap developed by the 3gpp the third generation partnership project that is the organization that defines the technical requirements and deliver the specification data point that then standardized globally by the corresponding organization so you see from this graph we have that the 5g in its release a 15 was a completely standardized uh and specified specified and standardized by uh september at 2018 including its standalone configurations and following at the earlier configurations such as the non-standalone and also the wireless interface was already completed back in 2017. this technology supports um and enhances the mobile broadband communications release 16 was completed last year in september and in the stances the it enhances the mobile device experience and introduces many features to achieve a neutral ladies communications services or both of them they full meet the itu requirements in particular the i2 vision that was formulated back in 2015. now as we speak we have the the specifications they have study items and um complete and down started the work items so the technical specification of the release 17 and that that version will uh that release will enhance further the emdb url c but in particular will address uh the problem of integrating millions of connections over a square kilometer beyond that we will start working on new new use case categories and that will lead to the definition of study items for 6g and work item for 6g leading to the system completions at least in terms of specifications by 2030. now um looking at the supported features um from release 15 to 17 and beyond i have made this slide that gives an overview of the performance compared to the narrowband iot and emtc coming as um over over the a 4g say technical beyond the 4g technical specifications namely the lte and that that i'd like to remark the fact that that this uh communication services will continue regardless the announcements uh we may have with the with the new the new radio so here you have the differences and in particular you may see when those two services uh or usage scenarios will be supported first observation i'd like to make uh that is the fundamental difference between the 4g so empty and the new radio is the fact that the new radio supports all spectrum that ranges for 400 megas um up to 52.6 gigahertz this is basically um already in release 15 and 16 and now we are thinking of modifying the waveform to reach out up to 71 uh gigahertz the differences between these two technologies are in particular as i said release 15 uh define the basics and the fundamentals suppose the fundamental enabling technologies uh to support and enhance the mobile services here you have a list of those in particular i would like to mention that the master my mobile informing is a supported by default so it's coming along with a new radio and it always supports network slicing and provides a baseline uh for uh security controls in assurance end to end then release 16 it is the main focus is to address the industriality and it supports a nice spectrum positioning a system down to three meters whereas the generation focuses on on the support of gps and in addition to this uh comes along with integrity taxes and uh bakul and in particular we have that the [Music] the technologies for a vehicle to x communications are also supported securities enhanced towards the iot and network slicing then with ready 16 we have uh the focus that shifted shifts towards the consumerity and here i'm thinking of critical critical iot or wearable devices it further enhances the positioning system and in addition um it brings as an integral part of the access network the new interest access network and in this case we are speaking of geo and leo satellites uh constellations it would support mbms and the multi-access computing for uh 5g communications so 5g uh really improves the security controls of and here you have examples of improvements in terms of controls and assurances uh we may say that the lte is uh really secure as a system but we have some specific announcements and here i'm thinking of the possibility of um um yeah encrypting or concealing the identity of the end users so the privacy is preserved even prior to the registration of the terminal and we also see we have the possibility of introducing integrity in the user plane between the terminal and the access network and it is all based on the concept of secret share keys that are available made available only in the core network so in the authentication repository function and the mobile based on these skills we are able to generate um all the remaining keys both for achieving um proper authentications of the communication even up to the application functions and at the encryptions or integrity of that particular interface interf and the looking at the other interfaces um between the co and u or uh between the different network uh function uh virtualized in the connector the standard also proposes a specific mechanism for uh encryptions as well as authorization and authentication of the communication here you have examples of protocols recommended beyond this we now have for the first time uh the possibility of complying with specific network equipment security assurance schemes that is the work done by gsma and to gpp that i have finalized already the first version of the specifications so that the vendors can get an audit report of their product development and life cycle processes as well as the test equipment and obtain a test report that demonstrates the fact that the element or the equipment in general compliance exactly with the uh security controls and and functions at the standards man dates and yeah it is of [Music] huawei already got uh an audit uh report uh um i think you know huawei huawei has already received the audit report for both the radio access core network and it is of december last year it was the test evaluation report for the lt and the new radio base stations now looking towards 2025 what kind of requirements and the new user scenarios are we expecting i have made this slide which capture the main uh most important directions so beyond the emdb um mmtc and urlc you're now thinking about uplink-centric broadband communications real-time broadband communications and harmonized communications and senses so very important here is the work done to meet and support services for machine and massive type of traffic communications now starting from the uplink centric bloomberg communications i'd like to introduce you the 5g to business applications they are already available and they will come commercially available say in a in a few years from now as you see from this graph we have different type of internet things we we we speak about massive iot broadband iot critical iot industriality depending on the devices that we connect the traffic is especially uplink and that's why we talk about uplink-centric broadband communication so we are currently having the possibility of connecting uh the iot uh with decent speeds and here you may see the the support the bit rates we will then have the possibility of offering other type of applications here you have example vertical sectors thanks to the fact that this system will support reduced latency and improved reliability real-time broadband communications example are the most important is the xr that stands for virtual reality and augmented reality and that here is expected that this particular service will uh grow exponentially uh by in the next say uh two to three years uh here you have more details coming from gartner and what we can see from this figure is that the shift will be from the support of uh the 4k for both highs 100 megabits per second bang we and we will be able to achieve uh a one gigabit pen we with latency uh less than milliseconds which will allow us in particular to enjoy say a service such as vr for socializing vr for any kind of vertical industry in particular integrating the possibility of dealing with digital uh twins and an example those are the smart cities harmonize communication and sensing um [Music] also important is to consider the possibility of connecting unmanned aerial vehicles and here you may see the the requirement that the system has to support in order in order to enable these communications uh and um you may also see here um the different type of digitally connected elements and here you have a view of the market and the volume of elements expected to be connected by 2025 so we we we are expecting more than 50 millions elements connected addressing um revenue more than 72 billions globally in order to achieve realize this vision is of course intended we need to have a proper regulatory framework in place and applications and control enabling platform so that all those services can be handled is this important to say something about uh still within this category uh about the um vehicles to ex communications beyond 2025 so by 2025 what we are expecting here is he we will achieve the level of conditional automation thanks to the deployment of 5g on support embb and vehicle 2x communications and then by 20. sorry by 2030 um we will expect advancements uh towards the full automation thanks to the deployment of 5g for urlc and the enhanced uh vehicle 2x uh protocols so what visions uh what vision do we have of the system uh by 2025 so it is a system that basically i support all possible services and service applications and it is a technically feasible and potentially business file for all possible scenarios and here you may see an example representation about personal communication what you get at home what could be rendered in the cars in particular all the industry uh potential applications in order to achieve this vision we need to have the uh um realize this vision we need to have the the right strategy and the strategy what we are posing consists of four main pillars and those pillars are represented here below so we need to know how to deploy the system and meet specific service applications requirements for b to c c stands for consumer b to b so means to business and then to home we need to integrate all uh spectra so means pen with um in the subtriggers sub six gigahertz and below 100 gigahertz we must absolutely simplify the side and in particular we need to revisit completely the network uh architecture starting from the criteria and the services we need to support the slides i present in high level the four months requirements in terms of resolution downlink uplink rates latency reliability positioning what we may enjoy today and what we uh target to achieve by 2025 you can see that the requirements are really uh much more stringent towards 2025 that would allow us to offer much better communication services um reduce latency and with an increase of the reliability and here you you have examples of different robotic platform that today we may achieve latency below 50 milliseconds we will target to be for the services it's the requirements to achieve less than 10 milliseconds uh two ways and reliability of five nine which is currently basically not possible because uh one of the features we need to have in place it is the multi connectivity and currently we just achieve our dual connectivity between the lt and the new radio yes the bat spectrum our strategy is to enable a oneplus n ultra simplified 5g network one will be say the the core bandwidth where the new radio will trust me at which the new radio will transmit and the other one will be especially dedicated to the lte in carry aggregation dual connectivity to boost the radiation and transmission capacity at the interface here you have examples of different deployment scenarios for respect to that has to be used or may be used to achieve the those particular communication services in different areas such as urban and suburban area as well as hot spots with the possibility of using millimeter waves or higher spectrum and larger bands and then ruler-wide coverage areas with the head of the sub one giggers uh one gear suspect here you may see the possible speeds that can be achieved and by aggregating at the spectrum in a combination of one plus n it is possible to achieve um really very very high uh um speeds um low latency and therefore support up to 12 24k er vr experience which is a um far much better that what you are experiencing today as a consumer where the resolution is limited to four maximum 8k sites must absolutely uh be simplify simplification design means to to get treatment read of pretty much everything you're having at today in place which is the cumbersome which is expensive which pollutes and has all the problem and it's extremely costly for our case so the target by 2025 actually the uh looking at the organization we're already having solution from this year will be able to shift from multiple antennas into uh towards and use a single blade antenna which supports the upper part say the new radio transmission the rubber part or the communications multi-mode sub three gigahertz including the new radio refarming we have a blade microwave antenna that supports the band together with the traditional spectrum and then we are now capable of integrating all those radio remote units into a 3-pole and dual band configuration and then easily connect uh places them on a mast and connect them to the corresponding passive antenna the uh yeah the bbu is a 1bu so baseball unit that serves all the modes and can be achieved by a simple soft upgrade the power at the battery has been also constituted into a blade configuration that allows us to do a multiplexing and research resource resources resources in terms of energy sharing between the different communication system and therefore save energy dramatically and reduce costs here you may see we have reached out more than 50 percent 50 percent saving consider that this is the most expensive part lucrative part also of the the five g system looking at indoor configurations or hotspot configurations what we think of now is to use the system which makes um which utilizes the same baseband units so the baseband unity it is pretty much it's exactly the same and then what we do here we are um having uh in place um radio remote hub that allows on our recipe or or separate interface to reach out multiple uh pico um rru's and those riu can uh work in informing or in a configuration or move to user mimo um allowing us to uh achieve positioning systems of a resolution or two meters which will basically make it possible to connect robotic platforms pretty much of any kind and improve the dongling and the uplink capacity of a factor of three to four the architecture we target uh by 2025 it is a an intelligent system which consists of a multi-axis type of solution that supports all scenario over a single assigned type of configurations here you may see the different deployment scenarios using a fiber as a front all way of connecting the active antenna units and the uh and the base stations and then or using a microwave or even uh including the possibility of having the an integrated axis and barcode then you have the fully distributed intelligent mesh solutions which um it is flexible and has all the capability for us orchestrating the system and to end sport net sizing in particular deploy artificial intelligence all over the places from the devices to the age and the different distributed data center and here you may see example of these technical challenges we are facing today's uh and the corresponding technology uh breakthrough um i've just mentioned a few of them so we're thinking now is to deploy the machine learning pipeline and therefore uh each of the function in place has to be orchestrated we are using a number of er enabled applications so we would need to be able to efficiently and effect properly provision them the system has in terms of machine learning pipeline uh many uh potential say a vulnerability therefore uh we are standing out and having in place at the same time uh solutions that are truly trust trustworthy their resilience and in particular they preserve privacy when we deal with different with different type of data and which may or may not involve the pii so uh yeah that's identifiable in formation and what we're thinking currently is that the uh machine learning could be the potential the machine learning can be further enhanced by um by making it work with the machine reasoning now um looking and beyond and thinking of how the system could uh further evolve i have captured a slide the key trends or if you want the the key challenges and the potential solutions to meet those a the corresponding this corresponding requirements so my vision is that uh simple the all intelligence will be connected and with zero trust and through the digital twinning using 5g 6g and in particular the machine reasoning will meet the machine learning at the agility network being the age anything that is uh around the and user practically looking at the 5g today would be uh in on the max or the multi-access computing platforms and uh yeah because we have to basically address the challenges uh we are having today in particular you may think of the costs that artificial intelligence has and as you may see on this slide from the iit in italy so there was a representation by roberto sigurani and giorgio meta you can see that the how uh ineffective and also inefficient uh artificial intelligence is is today and the power cost preparation it is a between a thousand to five thousand are then uh in machines compared to what would cost humans to perform the same type of operations and then of course you have other challenges that means that all intelligence will be transferred to the age and centralized there are no other possible solutions to simply address this particular challenge the intelligence will be there for uh moving at the age and which means uh definitely no more than 150 kilometers from the device due to the constraints we are having in uh delay uh in the propagations between the two points so we are expecting latency below uh 10 milliseconds and then uh yeah if you look at the machine learning itself the path recognition techniques there are many many many problems and limitations and biases so we need to find a way to improve their their performance and reliability and one way to do that is to make the machine reasoning work machine reasoning algorithm work together with exchange services with the machine learning then it's of course a must now to digitalize uh pretty much everything so not only business processes but also what we see and touch and that isn't necessary for us to improve the efficiency and improve the productivity and reduce the co2 or green green gas emissions uh by 2025 or latest by 2030 and another important thing that has to happen is the uh the performance shifting paradigm now from the 5g to beyond 5g and 6g because of what we we think of designing now it's not anymore a system that we connect the machines but we need to find a way to proper connect the intelligence so the visions uh and the revolutionary goal we are having with 6j is simply to shift from anything uh connected that that is the the mission the goal and what practically uh 5g achieves to uh connect all intelligence and uh what we're expecting is that the mobile communication system will be the fundamentals so the connected networks would be a fundamental enabler for the proliferations of the artificial intelligence and the the network itself will practically be used as a sensor as the eyes of the different intelligent entities to augment the machine intelligence which is a defined and i'm defining intelligence as the ability to represent knowledge process knowledge and also make a decision if any of these three element uh is missing uh we may not consider that particular machine intelligence no the vision of the 6g network is a in high level represented on this slide so the target is to connect the physical world in a suburb world and that will be through uh virtual uh augmented virtual reality and augmented uh reality so it's going to be a system that will support different type of channels of communication so in the downlink we are thinking of virtual reality type of communication vrar as that would be the way of communicating between the cyber and the physical world we need to carry the tactile signals so optic feedback uh for full immersive interactive experience or even holographic uh experience with the possibility of have by playing with the holograms the same thing as i had my hands on the physical on the physical elements and then of course the inferencing which means the way of carrying transmitting sharing uh the train models and and uh allow interference uh in the different part and or uh different device platforms and in the uplink the system taking advantage of the fact that he receives interest meat especially at the millimeter wave and terahertz it will be really uh um having we have we have capability of sensing and learning so uh in this case we are thinking of a massive amount of data that we reach out the network that will consist of the base stations uh that will transform into narrow range and the core network will be generalized in terms of neural centers and uh and the communications and uh the capability of reaching out the services will be not only using um um terrestrial uh access transmitting and receiving points but we will integrate the communication via the satellites and the satellites in use will be the low earth orbiting satellites with the altitude ranges from 300 to 1.5 kilometers which would allow us to achieve speeds of less threat than three milliseconds and practically speaking means faster than the deployed fiber it is due to the orthodontic uh surface distance which will be longer than what what we could get by um making communication two points via leo satellites um satellites will uh be very fast with an earth rotation time of yeah around two hours and the coverage will be also uh massive as the food will be between 100 to 1000 kilometers so the network architecture uh drivers uh or the fundamental uh shift in paradigm to achieve a 6g system are represented on this slide so we need to shift from today a cloud-centric system to a system that is truly a i native we need to move from information sentry to a network as a sensor so it will be really the sensing capability of the system that will make the difference also with respect to what you can do with the 5g today with respect to the main goal of 6g security centric today i presented earlier how the security controls uh have been announced in 5g respect to the lt the target will be to achieve a solutions or yeah that meets the requirements of a defense in-depth strategy augmented by the zero trust model with the security by design from day one we will shift from a generic bit pipe as it is today to uh user centric type solutions and the end user will be coming finally ultimately also the prosumer so that means the services will be not only made available by the carriers today but the end user whatever the end user is an individual as a customer sorry a consumer or working from home or an organization will be a part of the ecosystem that generate the new services including making available knowledge in whatever its representation will be to the broader community here you have an example of initiatives ongoing globally and i'm particularly close to uh what happened in europe as i was one of the founders of the 5g initiative i have formulated with my colleagues the vision of 5g and with my team we have contributed to all fundamental and every technologies you're having today uh in the 5g system in terms of communications but also ai application therefore i am still involved the activity on going europe where you may see that the 46g within the smart networks and services joint initiatives so it's a primary partnership that have made available 900 millions over seven years which means 200 millions more that they were invested when i was in europe with my colleagues which by the way i miss so much debt ranges from the european commissions down to all vendors because vendors say they have a need to work together to to achieve an agreement in terms of standardization copyright so that we really uh aim at achieving the the best out of the best in terms of architectures and enabling technology but also miss the carriers and the ecosystem of players that have allowed us to achieve what you have

together data into a single model a flexible user interface represents the whole network in a single pane an advanced data model covers all aspects of the 5g network and an efficient automation framework drives network planning and operations a natural first example for dynamic planning is 5g non-standalone architecture nsa a 5g non-standalone architecture is deployed by extending an existing lte network a typical scenario would be firstly identifying an existing lte site to upgrade to a support 5g nsa this is followed by upgrading an lte node b to enable dual connectivity and become a master node then expanding the backhoe capacity to support 5g bandwidth requirements then creating and assigning a 5g node b as a secondary node to the lte master node and finally rolling out the 5g node b to the network once rollout is complete 5g services are available to compatible user equipment network operators often have multiple domain specific inventory systems for different parts of the network such as core backhaul and wireless blue planet inventory simplifies the transition from lte to 5g non-standalone architecture by federating existing infantry and providing a single network planning capability in this example core backhaul and wireless network inventory have been federated and overlaid onto a geographical map the user can control the level of detail on the screen by using the layer controls by further federating cell site consumption data into the network map the user can see where the data capacity of the existing lte network is being heavily consumed and may be targeted for 5g rollout using the properties inspector the user can quickly identify the lte node b in the area of high consumption and check if it's ready for 5g nsa by verifying its dual connectivity status currently set to not enabled one important network planning capability at blue planet inventory is the ability to create sophisticated network diagrams the ring and spur diagram is an example where an entire primary ring network and its connected spurs are displayed in a schematic layout the user can pan across the network and zoom to specific areas or devices this diagram can also be exported for use in other engineering tools this part of the ring and spur diagram shows a cluster of radio base stations connected to a backhaul router which is in turn connected into the primary ring an essential prerequisite for 5g nsa rollout is enabling dual connectivity support in the lte network the red box on the diagram shows the user has selected an existing enhanced lte node b every object on the ui has a context sensitive menu with specific actions available for the object type and enhanced lte node b is part of a group of similar device types referred to as radio base stations for this e node b the user enables dual connectivity and sets the connective role to master these settings are applied to the planned inventory as part of a project and the user is given an acknowledgement of the change the plan changes can be rolled out to the network using blue planet multi-domain service orchestration mdso or similar capability blue planet inventory integrated reports provide key summary data the rbs assignment rollout report gives the user an overview of the dual connectivity status for this ring the increased bandwidth requirements for 5g will require expansion of the backhaul and core networks in this scenario a 10g router is added to the backhaul blue planet inventory network planner can support any level of complexity to modernize and upgrade the network including device rehoming ring expansion link aggregation vlan reassignment and ip subnet management to support the new 5g node b a new high capacity backhaul connection needs to be created this requires a new device at the same location as the existing lte backhoe device but with a 10g connection into the core the context menu allows the user to select an option to create a new router at this location the location for the 5g backhaul device is already pre-populated to be the same as the existing lte backhaul device the user selects the role a1 and the device type for the new 5g backhaul device blue planet inventory restricts the available device types to those applicable for the a1 role these settings are applied to the planned inventory as part of a project and the user is given an acknowledgement of the newly created device now we connect the new a1 device to the main ring network this is achieved by firstly searching for the device and initiating a create connection task in this case the user runs a partial match search on the first part of the device name which returns both the existing a1 router and the newly created router for the newly created router the create connection task is launched from the contacts menu the backhaul bandwidth defaults to the highest supported by the device to connect the device the connection routing is completed by first selecting the am device card and port and then the zn details selecting the a-n device card and port is performed from context-sensitive drop-down menus the zn device card and port details are filled in in a similar way to the a-end the plan connection is then committed in the blue planet inventory by selecting create an acknowledgement dialog is displayed to confirm the plan connection was successfully created when we see a refresh of the ring and spur diagram this shows the new a1 router once lte dual connectivity has been established and the core capacity is expanded the rollout of 5g nsa can be planned to assign a new 5g node b the user selects create rbs assignment from the context menu for the master e node b radio base station assignment rbs can cover several service type cases the user selects the service type to be assigned from the drop down blue planet inventory restricts the devices available to those certified by the network operator for 5g non-standalone rollout the user selects an ericsson 6318 as the 5g node b type from the drop down for a 5g non-standalone deployment the user identifies this node b as a secondary node for the cell the remaining values are auto-populated and the user completes the assignment by selecting apply after the new 5g node b is assigned the process is completed by selecting rbs rollout from the context menu data is pre-populated here based on the assigned rbs's for this location in this case there is only one rbs the new 5g node b the tying details define how the new gnb is connected to the backhaul network and are filled in from drop downs the recently created a1 device is selected all the details such as the time ports and plugin cards are selected using similar drop downs the rollout is then completed by selecting apply when we see a refresh of the ring and spur diagram we see the new 5g node b we now right click on this to launch the connection routing diagram the connection routing diagram shows the user plane traffic is via the new a1 router whilst the control plane traffic is via the master enb the diagram summarizes the physical layer 1 and the logical layers 2 and 3 connections for the gnb as well as vlan numbers ip addresses and ip ranges all of these resources have been created in the planned inventory using the blue planet inventory automation framework the connection routing diagram

where is my purple flash from folk art [Applause] which pretty much disappeared i'll have to remember that works that way i'm constantly experimenting i'd like it to stay but i probably should have cleaned the blade of my spatula off so there's a sort of a model background it occurs to me if i put dots on a lot of times i'll be able to stroke i'll be able to leave some striations some marks down through so i should wipe that spatula off before it gets used for anything else so the top half of this is going to be a different combination of the venetian blue the lighter color has the anita's white metallic in it i'm just basically trying to give myself some background colors but i like to play so much along the way that sometimes i stop and save something but we'll see how it goes i'm going to use some of my maiden white and what was the color i was planning on using um oh boy maybe some silver i never use silver let's use some silver and i love the purple that's not really dark enough it's also not a different enough color if i do the white i can do i've not i have not tried that combination of my medium white and my neon purple from folk art which always requires or at least is best seen after it's dry having encountered white during the painting process i will also wipe that off okay so here goes nothing am i going to do this like this i have a little scoop tool i know i do so like i said a lot of times you can make your own little shovel from packaging and i want a fairly even amount of paint without using a squeeze bottle maybe i could do black maybe a little more did i say these were my princeton article catalyst spatulas i could swipe that down there really easily so the whole plan was to use those those swiping tools and now i just want to play some more i'm going to push this paint right up looks like a cloud bank over some kind of lake to me it looks like escape is trying to trying to come about which is not really what i had in mind at all but that's okay okay so now where are my tools my tools are here maybe come out or don't darn let's grab my tweezers my tweezers are very sharp and they're stainless steel and they're a great tool to have in your arsenal because they will clean the tip out of something in fairly short order and if there's a big plug you can put them in and twist them around and it will pull out that big plug this one needs to have the threads cleaned out i'm thinking that if i use the prussian blue here goes my silver right across the top and then i think i'm going to put some black underneath it pour some blue but i have enough blue okay so let's do the black it's so indecisive right now let's leave some white i don't think the white will get left i don't want a straight line so i want a little wobbly and then i'm still going to use the neon folk the neon purple from folk art so let's go let's take my little weird tool see how far down that can go i don't know if i can put enough pressure on that to pull it down very far [Applause] it seems to go up just fine though so now we'll try another tool usually i don't do them all side by side i like to leave a little something in between since this is an experiment all bets are off including whatever we leave in the background actually i like a slightly more jagged horizon line how many different shades of color can we get i don't mind leaving some of that background i want to use my other spatula too see how that works as well i'm liking this this is fun the big one needs to dig in a little bit more i am making sure that the line is uneven i love the blue in the background i think i'm going to wipe that off before i use it again i like the little bits of purple [Applause] see if i can go you know what i'm going to use the edge just drag through a few things just freely experiment i want to use my little tool again and put my finger down on it and see if that makes a difference because i know it will i like that jaggedness there that's pretty cool do i want a little bit of black let's put some black right on there i could probably put some white red on there too why don't we do that where though i don't know where i'll do it right there push that up and bring it back down again wow that was a rather large lump of something that did not belong i'll just have to go through there twice go back to this little tool again black didn't make me as happy as i thought it would no gold wow i'm gonna steal a little bit of paint put it right in that little canvas he's showing thing still a little paint again since i've got that extra pain in there that'll be helpful well it's not a keyhole swipe i've got enough paint on my little silicone tool to do my edge i might still want to drag some things through it's hard not to swipe sideways or drag sideways so that it unearths some canvas so you have to really be focused on holding it right right side up i really like the idea of putting that in there don't ask me why [Music] i could pretty happily also go through and add a little turquoise just because i really like turquoise but i like that blue right there let's see if i can get away with a little bit of mysterious if it's not necessary i won't go for it it's just so subtle just a little here and there slight variation that's just a really dark and very iridescent turquoise just something to add a little tiny bit of variation on the colors make it a little more rich so this is priscilla vatsel in spring hill florida at expressionist art studio gallery saying thanks for joining me if you're

this i don't know how dark that purple is going to be tomorrow it might be very dark but look at those look at that nice pattern it's just i don't know if the silver will show up i almost never use silver but like i said this would make the nice i could stack these and make a really cool all-over print t-shirt i think and it will dry a little bit darker okay so you guys take care of each other

start from scratch endeavour most network operators already have existing inventory and operational support systems for their network domains such as radio access aggregation and core transport and for different mobile technologies such as 4g 3g or 2g blue planet inventory is able to federate these systems into a single accurate view of the physical network and logical services to provide a platform to migrate and augment the existing 4g lte network with 5g in a non-standalone architecture to expand into pure 5g network deployments using standalone architecture and finally to provide network slicing to offer dedicated service level agreements to customers dynamic planning enables mnos to plan more efficiently to reduce opex optimize network build-outs for low-latency identification and improve service time to market in a previous demonstration we showed how blue planet dynamic planning supports 5g non-standalone architecture rollout by enabling expansion of backhaul capacity and adding secondary gene node b's connected to a master enode b and the lte evolved packet core epc in this demonstration we will look at evolving the network to 5g standalone architecture to place 5g radios one approach is to federate existing cell site information and usage patterns to decide where additional coverage is needed but radio placement can also be a policy-based decision depending on the services that are to be rolled out as part of the strategic business plan once 5g radio sites have been decided the front hall mid-hull and backhaul connectivity needs to be configured to be able to cope with the larger volumes of data traffic from the larger numbers of 5g radios blue planet's dynamic planning virtual network function vnf model supports the distribution of vnf's which perform the various 5g network functions defined by 3gpp standards group openrun or oram is a true multivendor architecture with no locking which separates the traditional run functions into radio units ru distributed units du and centralized units see you with clearly defined open interfaces between them these functions can run on dedicated devices or private cloud at multi-access edge computing sites in the 5g core we have shared network functions such as access mobility management function amf and the session management function smf once the 5g standalone architecture infrastructure is built we can then look at defining network slices for ultra low latency services we create a dedicated user plane function at the mec close to the radio units in a large network there will be multiple mecs and multiple upfs in contrast the user plane function for enhanced mobile broadband is placed in the 5g core and scaled up to handle a larger number of user equipment with the slices defined the network operator is ready to offer 5g services with differentiated service level agreements the blue planet inventory dynamic map overlays each location in a network onto a geographical map this is an example 5g network with standalone and non-standalone elements to it centered around miami florida we have four radio units in this area and an aggregation router there is an edge local data center in central miami supporting the mec for this locality which is connected to a regional data center in orlando and a national data center in atlanta georgia so that's a geographical view let's click on our 5g demo again and choose diagrams network diagram to see the topological view of this network this network diagram covers the same devices as the dynamic map but now shows their logical connectivity in relation to each other on the left we have the four radio units and front hall aggregation device which is then connected into a local data center in miami where we can see a number of 5g virtual functions once we leave the mec at this local data center we then have a transport network that takes us through a regional hub in orlando and then through into the national data centers at memphis and atlanta for the atlanta data center we are showing the various vnfs which are running there in the bottom right corner of the screen we've got a non-standalone network where we see a g node b connected to an e node b which are co-located with blue planets comprehensive visualization we can now show not only the higher level 5g network but also we can drill down to see granular detail for instance in the transport network we can examine the connection running into the atlanta national data center by choosing diagrams routing diagram at the highest level we have an ethernet connection between augusta and atlanta in georgia we are able to see the various layers through which that connection is supported down to individual channels running on the dwdm fibre and how it goes through a series of transponders and connectivity to get from one location to another we're also able to look at what sort of capacity we have in the underlying transport network so as we expand our 5g network we can monitor our capacity limits and set notifications when we plan say 80 percent of the capacity let's take a look at this via the operations utilization summary option popping back up to the network diagram view we can inspect some 5g vnf's as well as being able to show vnf's on dedicated devices blue planet inventory is able to represent vnf's at multi-access edge computing private clouds running at local and regional data centers or also public cloud national data centers at the core to look at the centralized unit for the control plane we select the cucp and choose vnf summary the vnf summary shows the properties of this centralized unit control plane function in this case the underlying platform is a compute resource that represents the multi-access edge compute capability we can see the incoming f1c connection and the outgoing relationship to a layer 3 vpn running to miami now moving over to the networks menu we can expand compute to see the local regional and national data centers which have cloud computing capabilities from this miami local data center we can take a look at an impact report using the operations impact report option and this shows all the services and customers that are dependent upon this local data center and would be impacted if this local data center is not available we can see the three vnfs that are dependent upon the miami local data center if it were to fail we'd lose the centralized unit's control plane the centralized unit user plane and also a dedicated user plane function at that locality we can also see which customers are impacted in this case all of the services at this location are for the tg company customer we also gain an in-depth understanding of the connectivity into that local data center from the left-hand drop-down menu we will now jump into service inventory the services represented in the blue planet inventory service model can include layer 3 vpns ethernet services such as evc or e-access and 5g network slices the bpi network slicing model has two levels first the network slice subnets which are used to build up each network slice and second the network slice itself which supports the end-to-end 5g slash if we take a look at the ultra reliable low latency connection slice for the tg company customer in the miami area we can expand on the slice details to see that this network slice instance is comprised of four network slice subnet instances we have three shared network slice subnet instances the run which is where we see the distributed units and the centralized units the transport which uses an ipvpn to provide the connectivity between the run and the 5g core and the 5g core capability itself which runs the 3gpp 5g virtualized functions the fourth subnet is dedicated to the ultra reliable low latency connection and this is the tg company latency user plane slice and we can look at that in more detail by selecting the subnet name and choosing modify service we see that this user plane function has a latency specific f1 connection in the front hall network and two dedicated virtualized functions the cu for the user plane and the dedicated user plane function at the mec running at the local data center in miami from the left-hand drop-down menu we can select network inventory to view the network slice as a logical network let's select urlc diagrams network diagram and what we're able to see here is the pathway from the radio unit on the left hand side and then we see the distributed units and the centralized units as virtual functions and here we can see the shared control plane cu dedicated user plane the user plane function and also a breakout to the internet from this local data center then we have the transport part of the network which is this layer 3 vpn through an mpls core network to atlanta where we have our 5g core we also have a logical representation of an enhanced mobile broadband slice choosing embb diagrams network diagram the principal difference to the previous slice is that the user plane function is now at the 5g core in the national data center as is our breakout to the internet therefore an enhanced mobile broadband slice service may experience longer latency and will be suitable for time intensity traffic to further facilitate dynamic planning blue planet provides a guided operations capability called go instead of having to manually execute repetitive tasks the individual tasks and inputs are encoded into an automated workflow using business process model and notation bpmn users can launch entire process workflows with the click of a button from an intuitive dashboard significantly reducing the turnaround time of planning activities this go process automates the business process for placement of 5g radios definition of the front hull mid-hull and mec placement of the vnfs at the mec and finally the transport and 5g core design to create a new enhanced mobile broadband network slice this concludes the demonstration of blue planet 5g automation dynamic planning capabilities which help accelerate 5g standalone and network slicing

today's video i'm gonna be reviewing the brand new energy drink from dwayne the rock johnson himself this is the zoa energy drink it is the zero sugar and this is the pineapple coconut flavor which honestly just sounds like a pina colada so i'm not sure why they didn't name it that now in case you guys weren't aware i'm actually reviewing every single flavor of this energy drink on my channel i already have a few of them out so you guys should definitely check out the other flavors as well and i also plan on doing maybe like a tier list video of kind of ranking the different flavors out so far so before we jump into the taste test let's talk about the can itself so the branding on this can is pretty minimal nothing too crazy it doesn't really pop off the shelf though in my opinion but the black and silver and then the hints of the color which this one is white keeps it pretty minimal and pretty clean overall also i should mention the can size of this drink is 16 ounces so that's kind of the perfect size in my opinion i don't really like a huge energy drink like some of those monsters you can get like a giant one and then i'm not a really big fan of like a small energy drink like a red bull or something like that because i like to be able to sip on this and enjoy it while i'm working on my videos for my main youtube channel or just kind of first thing in the morning i don't want to just take a shot of energy like a five hour energy so 16 ounces is perfect in my opinion so let's talk a little bit about what's inside this can let's jump into some of this formula here so let's start out with the calories it comes in a total of 15 calories with the macros of zero fat three carbs and zero protein a couple of things i should note it has zero artificial flavors zero synthetic colors and zero preservatives also this drink is naturally flavored and then with zoa energy the rock has put a lot of time into or well maybe his team has put a lot of time into the healthy warrior blend is what they call it so in addition to just caffeine it has some other ingredients in it under immunity it has 100 dv vitamin c as well as vitamin d for focus it has vitamins b6 and b12 for hydration it has potassium and magnesium electrolytes for the body it has 250 milligrams of bcaas which is pretty cool you don't see that in every energy drink out there obviously the rock is big into fitness so it kind of makes sense and then as far as the energy goes it comes in at 160 milligrams of caffeine from green tea extract and green coffee beans uh yeah the formula is pretty cool that's actually probably my favorite part about their drinks i will say the caffeine level at 160 milligrams is pretty good i usually try to find a drink around 200. i'm not really a big fan of energy drinks that have like 300 milligrams plus of caffeine in my opinion that's just too much and then on the opposite i don't really want an energy drink with so little caffeine that i don't really feel it so i think 160 anywhere around that 200 is kind of the sweet spot all right so the moment of truth and why you guys probably clicked on this video you guys want to see a taste test and hear my thoughts on it so let's go ahead and crack this thing open best sound doesn't smell too bad this one actually is probably the best smelling one so far that i've had of all the flavors so something i do want to mention is honestly i'm not a giant pina colada fan i don't hate it by any means but it's definitely not my first choice i have had other ones out there like the gold 3d i know is pina colada flavored and although they don't say this is pina colada they say it's pineapple coconut it's gonna be kind of similar to that but yeah this thing does smell pretty good i'm not gonna lie it definitely smells more pineapple than coconut so let's taste this thing and see what it's like okay yeah that's actually pretty good not too bad okay so yeah this is honestly i feel like a pina colada i don't know why they didn't just name it that it's definitely more coconut than pineapple in my opinion but this is probably the sweetest tasting one that i've had so far from zoa energy the other ones are very natural flavor which maybe the coconut and pineapple is just naturally sweeter than those the sweetness is definitely higher in this but the pina colada flavor it's just not personally my favorite but putting that aside i'm going to try to give this a rating based off of just other drinks that i've had before and i think i'm going to put this at a 7.5 out of 10. so it's definitely not my favorite drink that i've ever had out there before like the ghost energy ones are some of my favorites which to me i would hands down reach for first over this but considering the zoe energy drinks some of them haven't been my favorite one so far this one actually surprised me and i liked a little bit more than i thought and the fact that i'm not a huge pina colada fan and i still think this isn't too bad should definitely say something now the ultimate test in my opinion which i talk about in all my videos is if you were on a road trip and you had to run into a gas station to grab a drink you want something for while you're driving would you reach for this personally the zoic cans in my opinion aren't really that eye grabbing especially for someone that i guess has never heard of them before it just kind of looks like another drink and actually a buddy of mine mentioned it kind of seems like a coffee can it seems more like the starbucks cans or something like that so it's not really gonna grab my attention and personally this flavor i probably wouldn't personally reach for this one again but if someone handed this to me and i was on a deserted island i wouldn't be too upset about it i think i could make this one work but guys that's gonna be it for this review i hope you enjoyed watching if you want to pick up any of these energy drinks for yourself i actually will have a link to them down below in the description they're shipping on amazon now which is super handy so you guys can pick them up for yourself there as i mentioned be sure to check out the other reviews from zoe energy and just other injury drinks i've reviewed so far on my channel and let me know in the comments below what you guys want to see from me in the future whether it be other energy drinks or maybe something like a supplement or even something else i might start branching off and trying other things but guys i hope you enjoyed watching if you did will you please drop this video a

we've done around trying to understand how Network slicing might potentially work with OpenStack and how OpenStack might fit into some sort of network slice and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk a little bit about 5g what it is in some of the use cases that are involved with some of the diversity in the use cases then we're gonna talk a bit about what network slicing is then we're going to talk a little bit about what network slicing might be like in terms of an nfe construct like gets the nfe what they're thinking about it and then we have a demo using a manoa system called open baton that happens to have a network slicing engine component and we'll have a little bit of a demo left and then we'll have some sort of closing pieces so my name is Curtis colic it I'm an open stack architect at a company a canadian company called inter dynamics and I'll let Corey introduce himself hi I'm Corey Eriksen I am also an architect at inter dynamical systems out of Edmonton and feel free like after this talk is over feel free to email us we'll put our emails up at the end if you have questions comments concerns criticisms about some of the things that we've said today feel free to let us know we'd always like to hear the feedback so some of the things we want to talk like I always like to start off talks and sort of give you my perspective of what we're considering when we're thinking about these things so we want to know you know what is networks icing and how does or will theoretically at work it's pretty obvious that it's got to be end to end so taking up an entire network so there's more than OpenStack that's going to be part of that so how is this all going to work together like in a way I'm sort of calling these domains so OpenStack as a domain there's other pieces that might be other domains what role will OpenStack play in a network slice and then you know what features does OpenStack have now that sort of meets the requirements or could meet the requirements and sort of where can we go from here so to introduce 5g okay so 5g we've all heard a lot about 5g over the last bunch of years and and as we're as we're starting to move a lot faster than that in that area so 5g promises to transform our network in an antenna fashion as we've as we've heard as our demands on the mobile side grow that demands on our core networks are going to grow exponentially so there's there's a lot of things happening that are going to require api's to control and to end you know we talk about networks slicing how are you going to control a network slice in networks that you don't necessarily control or owns we've got some off stated performance requirements that are expected to expand our 5g capacities as we move forward here's a diagram that we found interesting most of you have seen some of these diagrams many many times and this this is just a depiction of the often stated performance requirements so the light green area represents 4G and the darker green area is representing 5g so as you can see the next generation and networks are going to demand more of everything better latency better throughput and essentially just more out of our networks so this this diagram represents some of the potential major use cases that will present some demands on our networks some of the proposed use cases are enhanced mobile broadband which will bring us stuff like the ability to 3d stream video to our 4k 8 K mobile screens we'll also have some networks that reliable local low latency communications which include things like autonomous vehicles transit air multi-access computing and then of course we've got miss mission-critical broadcast and learning systems as well as machine-type communications which are our sensor networks smart buildings smart intersections all of all of those type of communications that are going to put more demands yet on our network so and yet just one more one more graph which just represents what some of those demands may may look like as we as we move forward for the for the major use cases so now that we've covered a bit of an introduction to 5g like we can see that there's some pretty diverse use cases and often like these use cases are competing right so and that's sort of where 5g starts to the networks Ising starts to come into play is because we have all these diverse use cases but how do we support them all at the same time you know how do we understand which ones are more important and should have higher priority how does this all work together so how do we support these diverse use cases so I should say too that we did quite a bit of reading so at the end I'll show what I'll give you a link to all of the documents that we read we have a bibliography that's about a hundred papers whether they're academic or white papers or others so we did quite a bit of reading and took some of these diagrams from these documents and I've put the source down for each one of these but I like this well this is one of my favorite diagrams that we came across because it not only indicates that we have multiple slices like you know including all the way down to a phone but it also shows that the places where OpenStack could part would participate in the in this entire slice right so we see a core cloud depicted and we see a edge cloud depicted and that's those are places where OpenStack could be involved in this entire network slice having done all this reading you know we realize how many organizations are involved in creating you know what 5g is and what 5g network slicing is so every single one of these standards bodies and groups has some sort of opinion on what network slicing should be and what it should look like so like so some of them have more in fluence than others but they all have an opinion of some kind so having done all this reading I pulled a whole bunch of quotes out and it was Cori and I had to fight a little bit for me to like because I had like five pages of quotes that I wanted to put on here but we managed to just bring it down to a couple here where you know obviously where we pull out all this information and one of the things is that you know this is an end-to-end logical network like a network slices some sort of end-to-end virtual network or logical network that rides on top of physical network and they're all co-located on the same physical infrastructure typically the other probably the reason we have the second quote in there is because of the cross domain portion right so we could not only see Network slices be made up of different devices and different clouds but also potentially different operators so we could have multiple operators that are participating in a network slice so through all these documents we pulled out a few of the major requirements that we that were pretty much in every one of these documents right so I've mentioned end to end a couple times you know we have we need to orchestrate these network slices they need to be on demand we need to be able to create them and destroy them dynamically we need to be able to give them additional resources and take them away they need to be extensible we need to be able to add different features and capabilities to these systems and because they're virtualized because they're logical we also need to make sure that these a slice can't one slice can't interfere negatively with another slice so we need things like safety in terms of failures safety in terms of protection we also need the ability to do some sort of hierarchical model for these aka recursion where we could build a slice out of a section of another slice right and that's to me that's one of the big things that I'm having some issues determining how that might work in OpenStack where we want to be able to build networks network slices from pieces of other slices isolation flexibility we need to expose api's and slices to potential third parties to other operators to other services across domain again and not just OpenStack deployments but also you know switches routers anything that can make up a network right and all that anti kangaroo this is one of the diagrams that I found that I thought could was kind of funny because there's a kangaroo so now that we've talked about 5g a little bit we talked a little bit about what network slicing is and what some of the requirements might be we also want to consider how network slicing might work in nfe and network function virtualization like how are these two things going to work together because from a high level like network slicing is not necessarily a piece not defined by network function virtualization right so there's the network slicing is not part of you know Etsy and a fee at this point right so how are these two pieces going to work together so there's this is discussed in a few documents but I pulled one pull quotes out of there but like you know like so in order to do network slicing we're probably going to need nfe because we need to build network virtualized network functions and make them part of a network slice and typically that might also involve using some sort of Sdn as well so in order to do network slicing we don't have to have in a fee but we probably will in order to do network recycling we might not have not have to have Sdn but we probably will so this is another diagram one of my the diagrams that I like that we came across I like this one because we see that there is a vnf that is part of an actual slice right so Network slices aren't just like a you know like most of us are probably familiar with like a VX land-based network a layer 2 network and OpenStack there's more to a network slice than just providing some sort of virtual network right like we we could also put a vnf or a series of vnfs in a chain that make up a part of a network slice and so that's why I like this diagram because it depicts the slices but it also shows that network functions you know it could be will Canon and will probably be part of a network slice so a lot of people in this room have probably seen this diagram many times I just wanted to put it up here for reference in case there were people who hadn't seen it but in in the Etsy II in the typical Etsy diagram that we have here we have the N FBI and the vim which is typically the part where OpenStack lives and when we're thinking about where we want to put network slicing there's a document that CGR NFV eve 0 1 2 that sort of gives us an idea of where a network slicing engine might fit into right so something is probably going to control network slices control their creation and all those different requirements that we mentioned at the beginning but you know what is that thing and in this document they're suggesting that there's some sort of network slice manager Network slice engine and separate components that live outside of the the N FBI and the vim and you know maybe the orchestrator talks to to those functions so this is just a bit more about that this particular Etsy document that talks about you know how network slicing might fit into NFV so you know so as of according of this document as of this time there's no common definition of network slicing but it's probably safe to say that it's we can feel like in terms of nfe it's a resource centric view of a network slice right so there's the potential is this is another interesting component so again there's not necessarily a strict definition of what networks I seeing is going to look like and I like I think this diagram is particularly particularly interesting because there's multiple Sdn controllers so often we think of Sdn we think if there's one thing that's controlling the network but in this diagram they're suggesting that there could be multiple instances of a 7 Sdn system so each Network slice potentially could have an SDN controller of its own so we it when when we're creating these networks Isis we might actually be instantiating multiple Sdn controllers to do this and I'm not sure if that's how it's actually gonna work out but if it does that's a kind of an interesting model right like where we can how can we instantiate multiple not only slices but Sdn controllers per slice or how you know how is this gonna work okay so OpenStack and network slicing we're going to talk a little bit about what OpenStack brings us today so today OpenStack provides you know some of the key components that we're going to need if if we're going to look at network slicing with OpenStack so we've got isolation multi-tenancy management API is it's cloud native elastics and flexible open stacks become the de-facto vim sorry the de-facto standard api for for the vim in the marketplace it also brings us the ability to do multiple Sdn integrations so we can have multiple clouds with with different SD ins in place so emerging trends edge computing using OpenStack we're hearing more and more and more about OpenStack on the on the edge and and how that's working so and there's also a multi cloud management so here's a list of some of the related projects related OpenStack projects features specs that we found interesting and will very likely play a role in in a 5g Network of the future so Curtis can talk more about some of these in a moment as we as we move forward so the network slicing demo coming up in a moment it's going to demonstrate launching a simple Ubuntu based vnf and utilizing the Neutron QoS features so we focused on that so we saw a pretty big list I'm just gonna hop back to this one for a second we should there's this is not an exhaustive necessarily an exhaustive list either of all the different components or projects or specs in OpenStack that could be very useful in network slicing one of the ones that I think is probably more important right now is the work that's being done on the novo placement API where this placement API is going to be a place where you can put inventories of resources that we have available in the cloud and not just like compute storage but also like networking and they almost my impression is that almost anything we'll be able to track in the Nova placement API eventually this will get broken out into its own system that'll be get broken out of Nova and into its own separate component also a J pipes one of the prominent sort of developer in OpenStack is said the NF EU stands for a never ending feature velocity as he's doing his work on this Nova placement API a group based policy group based policy is a pretty fascinating project that provides like a declarative abstraction right so group based policy has actually been around for quite a while I don't know how much uses gotten but it's actually a very interesting abstraction in terms of how people can use and create network resources in OpenStack it's it's also based on sort of a network service chaining concept and I think this would be more at a layer three sort of network service chaining concept but it's it's it's kind of fascinating that this kind of ability capability already exists an open stacking could potentially be adopted in a network slicing context right so it's it's pretty interesting that this exists already Neutron are back so I don't know how many people are familiar with this but it's actually possible to share Neutron objects with multiple tenants right so this is a there's actually a pretty fascinating capability in terms of that you could you can create a network or quality-of-service policy and you can share it through multiple tenants right so often in OpenStack we sort of had this like you know admin or not concept right but in this capability with this capability we kind of start to get this hierarchical recursive you know capability where we can share it we can create groups and share things with multiple tenants and it's not just admin not admit of concept so our back is pretty fascinating so there's a couple other projects that I think are related to network slicing the Neutron common classification framework which is being worked on right now there's a spec provide a link but it's there's a whole bunch of different projects in OpenStack such as networking SFC firewall as a service and a couple others that actually classify traffic in some in some model right so what if there is a centralized place where we did that we could use to classify traffic right and then obviously that would be pretty useful in the network site in the context of network slicing there's also work being done in terms of network aware scheduling where we could instead of just scheduling based on compute storage we could also schedule based on networking so this is mostly focused around like a rack aware concept but it could potentially be used for other models of scheduling as well and then probably the most important one in the one that we're going to use today is Neutron quality of service so currently you can build quality of service policies you can apply them to ports and networks in Neutron and right now there's basically two different ways that you can apply quality of service one is with egress bandwidth and the other is doing dscp markings so we've talked a little bit about the fact that we're going to use open baton and it's not replacing engine and that engine can use the bandwidth limitations to apply quality of service to a port in the future there it seems like there are has been some mention of being able to do minimum bandwidth as well but that's a little bit trickier because you need to be able to schedule things right so the scheduler would have to be aware of how to of the of what resources are available like my background isn't necessarily strictly networking I'm not like a classical networking person but my impression is is that in general a lot of times sort of network engineers might consider quality of service is something that's a pretty difficult problem and maybe in some ways not solvable but I think given the fact that where we control we would control a network slice from end to end you know there's definitely the potential to actually be able to do some quality of service so in this example we're gonna do what we said we're gonna do which is talk a little bit about open baton and then show a demo of actually having it apply quality of service policy sure so here's a here's like a diagram that we found from the DI Tripoli that indicates a placement of network slicing slicing engine sorry in relation to to the mono and the vim in this case open stock open stack and open baton so you can see where that fits in in there and here's another interesting diagram that we found that represents an end and network with multiple network slices that may require QoS and and possible service function chaining to deliver the demanded service or function so you can see the this slice is carrying through the network there so interesting note when we were when we were looking at the source code of open baton trying to get it up and running we actually found that the the QoS policies were were hard-coded in into it and you know it shouldn't be hard to change that but it it was interesting to find that we couldn't dynamically define what the QoS policies work with with open baton and maybe I should take a second here to say that that open baton is a reference implementation of the mono structure so it's not necessarily meant to be like a full man--oh that maybe you would use in production but you know I think the value and we'll get to this more but the value of it is that it's quite small in terms of its code base so when we were working on this the documentation actually said that the the way that you utilized it was to use a minimum bandwidth but then we could actually just go and it was incorrect so we could actually just go into the code and read the code and find out what the right way to specify it is and then as we were doing that yeah we noticed that you know like we have different quality of service values that are hard-coded and including one called Cole which I like a lot yes and what and and while Kurtis likes likes coal we're actually gonna focus on using the bronze policy in our in our demo here so okay so very simply I'll just go quickly over the demo before we get to it but we're going to use open baton baton to instantiate a single vnf into our OpenStack instance the vnf the the vnf descriptor has been predefined with the QoS policy requirements so everything's in place for us when when we launched at the BNF so the vnf will then register with the network slicin engine and and receive a notification the notification will include include those qsm QoS policy requirements and then the network slicing engine will ensure that the QoS policy exists in the cloud and if not it'll create it so and then of course the the policy will then be applied to the vnf support so see if I can get this get this right without too much trouble okay so in the top left corner we have the open baton logs bottom left corner we have the network service slicin engine we're going to launch the vnf using open batons web interface and this will make its API calls to the OpenStack API create our instance which we'll see in a moment here so we see on the bottom right hand corner we see now we have an open stack instance there there's no QoS policy there but if you see on the top right hand corner we're listing out the policy on the port that now exists and and those policies are zero so QoS hasn't quite yet taken effect yet because it doesn't know what to what to apply we still don't have a policy in our cloud yet so we got a a time speed-up here we're just waiting for the vnf the ems the element management system on the vnf to come up and then it's going to register the network slicing engine is going to see it and then we should see eventually the policy created in so on there we go the policy has just arrived and we can see that the the policing burst rate and and has has now got a number attached to it so that's that's based off the bronze policy that that has come through also so this is a fairly simple use case we just have one vnf all we wanted to do is show that a quality of service can be applied to a particular port once the vnf comes up you could imagine if we had a much more complex network service that had multiple vnfs coming together and we could apply the same quality of service policy to all of them and so see how that brings us to the open baton lessons learned so we had some issues with the OpenStack 4j plug-in and wound up having to compile from source it actually turned out that open baton as Curtis mentioned is a reference implementation it comes with a bootstrap script so you can get it running in your lab fairly quickly however we found that our best success was to download everything pilot from source and and and make it work that way so yeah one of the positives the the code base is very very small so if you want to get it up and running in your lab modify it you know work with it for your purposes it's it's fairly small and easy to get to get a handle on so there's so overall conclusions from what we experimented with so as I mentioned I have some questions around how we're gonna do like hierarchies in recursion which seems to be a requirements of network slicing I mentioned that we have we could potentially have multiple Sdn controllers involved so each life could possibly have a network and Sdn of its own there's only two current quality service mechanisms max bandwidth and dscp it would be really interesting to be able to schedule based on network resources one of the big questions I have too is around monitoring right so we know that network slicing has requirements from some pretty serious performance requirement or sorry 5g has some pretty serious performance requirements so how are we going to understand you know where's jitter happening in the network in a network slice how much latency is actually being utilized in the network slice how are we gonna figure these things out I talked to fair amount about group based policy I think it was ahead of its time I don't know how much you so it's actually gone I'm I'm curious as to where it is now and I would like to see that how it could potentially be applied to network slicing maybe there's a potential to modify or add some features to group based policy to make it capable of doing network slicing multi cloud management so we have regions in OpenStack but that's basically for the most part just ability to share Keystone in glance so how can we have multiple OpenStack deployments and be able to connect them together network wise right like how can we and not just connect them together but have them understand how to have them be able to talk to one another and have some sort of understanding as to what's going on there one of our we also have done quite a bit of research into the current state of service function chaining service function chaining is kind of fascinating because in a lot of ways you can just make packets here on interfaces anytime you want right like so we did we could build almost any chain and just drop packets wherever we want and if we can do that then you know it's almost too flexible right like how do we how do we monitor that how do we manage that I have quite a few questions around that and then of course one of the bigger ones is this third-party stuff like how do we prove how do we have like third parties and external operators how are we going to give them access to these network slices and management API s and how are we going to manage those you know like what a third party who has a networked slice also need access to OpenStack API is you know like if so like what what would that actually look like I mentioned our service function chaining you know like how if we do service function chaining as part of a network slice how do we how do we troubleshoot that right like so do we need some sort of path tracer what kind of functionality we need to be able to troubleshoot a network slice if you if it's using service function chaining right orchestration you know like the definition of orchestration in some of these documents is the continuing process of selecting resources which kind of suggests like online scheduling right like we don't really do that when we schedule a resource and OpenStack it's like the one time thing you know like so if orchestration is continual what does that actually mean how can we do if if we need to how do we do online scheduling when a resource has already been scheduled can we move it around can we do what does that actually look like there's as we mentioned we did a ton of reading and I'll show you the bibliography or the link to the bibliography at the end but they're all pretty high level right like there's a very there's very few maybe one or two out of a hundred that discuss how you would actually apply network slicing in a in a real world environment right so that's a bit challenging I mentioned intercloud networking already but also like I think some of the something that I've sort of have glossed over in this presentation is that there's a lot of features at an open stack that already exist in some ways we take for granted right we have the ability to create virtual networks and virtual routers and virtual ports and you know like create isolation using them in some capacity whether it's excellent or some sort of encapsulation but overall like there's all these great places to do work and create you know a good support for network slicing so to end this off I have three potential solutions or sorry scenarios and these are just like just sort of me thinking about like where could we go from here right so these are not necessarily statements of fact because at the bottom you can see I actually put these or not statements effect so I'm just kind of thinking about like where could we go so a potential scenario number one is like we just continue on sort of what we're doing now right like that things everything's fine you know OpenStack is growing in terms of nfe but it doesn't really necessarily need to have a concept of network slicing right so we just kind of move forward based on that concept where OpenStack doesn't need to know about networks icing right we just build network functions and maybe an SDN manages a lot of the networking that we need for service icing or network service networks icing you know we monitor KPIs with you know third-party tools Sdn probably provides a lot of the metrics most of the components could be outside of OpenStack you know the orchestrator would take care of the orchestrator would be the main thing that really does most of this work if we really need to do this sort of recursion and hierarchy and and additional quality of service requirements you know maybe it's just too much work right it's just too costly and maybe nobody wants to do it and maybe there's other things that we should be focused on in terms of upgrades in OpenStack stable versions and or stable releases and things like that so that's that's one possible place the next scenario could be that we do OpenStack has some concept of network slicing right so we could improve the quality of services features that are available maybe we could do network scheduling based on minimums maybe open sack has some sort of concept of network slicing perhaps it's based on networking SFC the project next OC or group based policy maybe we do some sort of work there to improve things also I mentioned you know how do we monitor all this but how do maybe we can deploy never have a API that deploys network probes so I'm a big fan of the Octavia load balancer project which like actually instantiate and creates virtual machines that act as load balancers like sort of in it's kind of a self-hosted concept right maybe we could do the same thing with network probes potentially the edge model really gets moving and we can start to pull in some technology from some of the requirements that are happening there and then maybe we accept in some ways that open stacks best fit might actually be in the telecommunication industry right and then scenario 3 is just OpenStack has like a network slicing becomes like a first-class citizen right so we get a maybe we get our own project that is a network slice manager we dial quality of service up to 11 maybe we could do online scheduling in some capacity if it's actually really required maybe we have the ability to build out sub api's and and really make the permission systems more capable of having allowing third party systems and external operators and and so forth so that concludes the this part of the presentation so thank you very much I did put a bibliography up there I have to go through it and make some Corrections but we put every single paper that we found in that bibliography you're free to email me email us if you have questions or comments special thanks to the open baton team it's a really nice piece of code that is a reference implementation and you can put it in your lab and it doesn't you know you know you can run it on an 8 gig VM or something like that or even smaller and with that I'll open it up to questions fantastic presentation I would say and number two option and number three option I think we can start with two and go towards three that's my thinking right now and I should appreciate the protocol the chrono Fraunhofer folks of open baton Griese pay Carol I think and his team they are a great team and they really have done a great job and for you you have dug the entire I think it's like a finding out from Bible there is what almost very good thanks on the scenario - I have a question for you specifically I don't know GBP group this policy suite was there I recollect in quantum that's the time when we started on group basis yeah if he is around I don't know but certainly there the question comes when you talk about policy being common for the group do baseball season to it you have a contract and you apply the contract and you apply the policy the policy itself when you apply to virtual network so are you saying the policy is common or are you saying that like you said admin and no that is admin Arnim yeah that is the way you share right if you share a side when you share with everybody or you don't but here you are talking about a tenant and another tenant - tenant sharing common policy or is it the policy itself such that both the tenants can see each other's share each other's limited whatever scope limited yeah I think that so first off we have we have a lot of work to do in terms of understanding or group based policy is so I'm gonna be really honest with you that we didn't do a lot of research into and actually how group based policy works but from like a high level it seems to me like a really good abstraction to use in terms of you know building some sort of network slicing capability but I think that you're almost question is like more like the the neutron are back stuff right like I think yes we would absolutely if we had a an object that was a group based policy of some kind we would want to be able to share that with multiple tenants so that we can do like the recursion and hierarchical meet those requirements as well so I think I think absolutely I would want to be able to share those with multiple tenants or no tenants if you know so you're saying that because of the vehicle requirements you can have multiple means as a bundle and then one can share the others resources yeah yeah cost yeah the other other portion I want to know what you have Radio Network you've got the core network then there is a mapping between the slicing on the radio side versus the core side do you have any thoughts on the mapping like in the carrier domain we have got interact you burst traffic like DCP and all that we do the is there anything like that mapping you know seen in any of these no not yet no I don't have so we even though I talked about multiple domains we really only considered the OpenStack domain like the currently the open baton never exciting engine can only work with Neutron but as soon as you assume if we added some code to it then it could talk to anything and we could now we could start to like do multiple domains but we didn't we didn't actually approach that in this in this presentation motion used well like the master yeah we had we had to we had to compile for master to get more of some quite a few things to work yeah absolutely absolutely fantastic job and I think people must clap for you yeah okay thank you thank you do you have any other questions I don't know if it's so much of a question but some comments I think a hybrid of all three of these things are quite insightful Jeff from Lumina Networks coming from the open daylight standpoint and own up and some of the other projects you've got your finger on exactly some things that need to happen from an OpenStack project perspective regardless of what the long-term view is yeah having quality of service as first-class citizen having this concept of slicing as a use case of quality of service these types of things are mandatory when we talk about things that are effectively you know network namespaces and intrinsically shared elements in order to really meet carriers SLA s and indeed I I would say you know let's not be down an openstack that there are certainly large enterprises that have these same kinds of requirements and internal SLS you know whether they be federal or financial or what-have-you but absolutely finger on the trigger in terms of service function changing may be group based policy as well but especially that QoS resource reservation and things like that mandatory for these use cases so even even if there is an overarching Orchestrator even if it is an overarching motto that is this handling creation of things these are critical components to uh for the community work on here great thank you thank you okay well thank you very much we'll see you around thanks everybody", "NgE0xq63ol0": "[Music] in today's competitive landscape network providers are struggling with operational challenges inventory systems are static and do not reflect the real-time state of the network furthermore they are fragmented across multiple inventory systems beyond inventory operational support systems OSS are also fragmented this leads to data integrity and synchronization issues across multiple inventory systems causing high service order error rates and slowing service fulfillment processes in addition the lack of Network inventory visibility creates in efficient utilization of network assets some resources are underutilized while others are at a capacity threshold these challenges lengthen the time it takes to successfully complete operations processes reducing customer experience and as a consequence negatively impacting revenues inefficiencies and inconsistencies make transformation difficult and expensive there is a growing need to more closely connect inventory to the reality of what is happening on the network especially as networks evolve from physical infrastructure to virtualized software-defined networks this is a critical requirement in order for automation to succeed you can't automate unless you have a correlation between your OSS and the network without that we would see any provisioning automation fail requiring human intervention to identify and re-engineer the discrepancy and then rerun the order therefore getting control of your inventory ensures that the data underpinning critical IT and network operations is accurate and comprehensive allowing you to benefit from intelligently automated processes that enable your journey to the adaptive Network Blue Planet has developed the inventory and network synchronization solution i ns whose primary objective is to identify and correct discrepancies between network resources and OSS inventory ILS provides three key capabilities Discovery Federation and reconciliation the I&S solution was developed to assist service providers uncover and correct discrepant is between network resources and OSS systems to prevent the impact on service order management and operations and engineering processes let's take a look at the capabilities in more detail starting with discover using resource adapters the discover module collects data such as resources and circuits at layer zero through three via controllers or directly from network resources and passes it to the federal using the collection engine the federated model collects and normalizes data from OSS systems and discovery to update the federated resource data store the UI on top provides a federated view of the data model this may also include data from multiple sources such as business and operation support systems database management systems and spreadsheets and in fact in the deployment with fiber lines data was collected from spreadsheets and a database and they use Blue Planet inventory as the OSS finally the reconcile module identifies and corrects differences between networks or PSA's and operation support systems discrepancy manager is vendor agnostic and standardizes physical logical and service information against OSS systems to enable unified visualization and discrepancy reporting and finally network correlator highlights discrepancies between the OSS systems and network resources which are then presented to users through the UI and can update identified resources or OSS systems let's take a look at the areas of value offered when customers deploying a NS in the deployment with fiber light they were having a lot of order fall out because their operations support systems used for ordering and the network were not in sync these are not in sync and you try to provision a device that the OSS says is there but is not in front there or is not configured the way it's supposed to be then the order fails and naturally by decreasing order fall out will increase order success and thereby increased revenues fiber light had to consolidate their data into a single repository from all the disparate spreadsheets and database files they were using then with the consolidated repository they needed better operational visibility of the discrepancies between the network inventory and the OSS so how did we help using that discovery module we were able to discover the network resources and load that to the Blue Planet inventory model then we followed that with the OSS data which was also then loaded to the model the combined OSS and network data is then consolidated into a single repository using defined policy rules we provision discrepancy reports and finally we were able to reconcile those discrepancies this can be done manually by the service provider or we can do it in an automated way using predefined rules that we can provide to push the reconciliation through an API to the system which has the discrepancy our solution provided fiberlite with the synchronization required to ensure when orders are placed they don't fail by decreasing order fallout fiberlite were then able to see both increased revenues and also faster time to revenue if we look at the business value and benefits I NS allows you to ensure order to service by reducing order fallout why because you have a valid OSS system used for provisioning and a network they are both in sync and reflect exactly what is in the network orders can therefore be provisioned with less chance of failing another benefit is within the trouble to resolve space or service assurance space now that we have the synchronized and accurate data in the OSS and the network it's easier to identify and resolve problems thereby reducing our pecks and increasing customer satisfaction and in the plan to build space now that we have discovered the network and we have the OSS in sync we can see which assets are stranded or underutilized previously this would have been a manual process working with engineering to get a view of what is in the network [Music]", "752DBGq8Re0": "[Music] 5g is now and this is what our new video series is about an hour 5g book that you can read online today we would like to take a closer look into the air interface aspects of five g 5g provides a flexible neurology in order to support many different services but let's visit one of the authors of our 5g book in his lab dryness twofold Heine I have a challenging question for you today what are the benefits of these numerology z' in a single word Wow indeed that's a very tricky question so for me it's definitely much easier to explain 5g a interface aspects on writing various pages in our 5g technology book but pretty if you challenge me like that to explain the benefit of the interface numerology is in a single word okay um personally I would use the term flexibility so 5g has to cope with various aspects requirements and services so that's also the 5g interface has to prove a very high flexible configurations now as we explained in our 5g technology book OFDM a is the basic waveform in 5g and we allow various numerology is like SAP hair spacings sumu duration etc unfortunately as always in physics there is no perfect waveform yeah so that's also there's no perfect numerology if I go for let's say a more narrow sub here spacing we have the advantage of better channel equalization reduce complexity we gain some robustness because the reciprocal is system iteration of the subway spacing so symbol duration is longer so if I speak a very slow it's easier to comprehend on the other side if we use a wider subcarrier spacing yeah then we reduce the complexity in the f50 operation and especially in the fa2 frequency range millimeter wave we gain the robustness because we did use the impact of the face noise and also we reduce the solo duration and therefore we gain latency so we see 5g offers a great flexibility in the interface aspects on the inside what about the complexity yeah and to see how easy and simple it is to set up a 5g cell I would like to show you is our signal generator the smw 200 how to set up a 5g cell so I'm going into the menu like here to set up a five cheese cell or let me select a boundaries of 50 megahertz the reason why also explained in our book then I have two selection of all possible values and now we can see it in that menu 15 30 and 60 killer sub-q spacings are offered I'm operating in fr1 if I would change to F at 2 millimeter wave then you would see the numbers the 60 to 120 and the 20 and 40 kilohertz when running several numerology is in peril at the same time

solutions that the service providers will need in order to enable 5g in their network and it's not just about the service provider we're finding that 5g is something that enterprises really care about and they want to know how they can advantage themselves by enabling themselves to take advantage of 5g technology very early for many customers it's gonna give them a much better level of service it's going to give them faster download speeds it's going to give them calling TV and harder places to reach where we might have struggled before particularly train stations and places like that where it's been harder for us to prove connectivity into just because of the new protocols of 5g has it's probably take a couple of years for the smartphones to develop you know really customers are going to see a much better overall experience and be able to download a film much faster be able to watch live streaming much better and more locations I'm really excited about it but it is you know 5g is a 10-year journey it's gonna take time for us to build our everywhere in the UK but you can count on on BT and EE being first out there and for us to give our customers the this great experience 5g for me is basically two things its first an even better engine for the mobile broadband the mobile broadband that will love and use and it's a global thing but the mobile broadband as such can't really give the industry any growth growth has to happen outside mobile broadband and there comes in the possibilities to add other industries other ecosystem into the network that can benefit from it and I think the main theme there is therefore twofold first it is of course a five year radio with it's even better engine for the mobile broadband but secondly it's a network slicing it's a cloud it's the data center it's a virtual nodes the ability to create parts of an ecosystem for other industries that can benefit from it it can range from police and these kind of solutions for professional communication and until entertainment services such as virtual reality augmented reality all of these will contribute to and open up for new revenue streams for the operators and I think that's a at the end of the day what both party is all about it's new revenue streams for the operator and this industry's yeah well I'm a huge hockey fan being Canadian and I don't know if you've ever been to a little league hockey game but it's funny I think it's also somewhat like a little league soccer game and you know why all the kids are on the field and they think they're playing their position but really what they do is they swarm around the ball and I think I like that's what we have today with connectivity right you get a Wi-Fi access point or you're at home or in the office and you swarm around these hubs of connectivity but as players mature and as they get older they realize what it means to play positions and really you get the best out of a team if everybody can play their own position and that's what I think 5g enables it really enables this ubiquitous access of connectivity that enables each player each device each part of the system to really play their own role and then we get the most right out of the end solution I think you know it's all about the scale in terms of you know the experience the managed services that we provide and the customers are looking for rapid deployment they are going through the digital transformation and changing the business the way they do and so most of the time it's not just about that wireless connectivity that's important that's table stakes but a lot of our customers are interested on layers of value on top of that could be analytics understanding how their customers are interacting with them where are they shopping in the store those kinds of things you know the technologies are one thing you know it's it you'll be a great formative technology that'll actually drive pervasive computing and pervasive connect but really what what what gets us excited and gets our customers excited is the fact there will be all sorts of services that now can actually be really executed and put to put to bear that in the past we're very much you know within the realms of science fiction and in the in the realms of so to say right being able to actually create services where you can do near real-time decision-making based on artificial intelligence actually have policies in the network that follow the requirements of the customer business processes these are types of things that need to be near real time they need to be immersive they need to be such that the end customer actually feels the level of intelligence right there and things like edge compute things like you know you know high speed ultra-low latency

need super fast connectivity next up is our pdx 5g again this is a mobile powerhouse it's it's a you've got 5g connectivity you've got poe you've got ac power input dc power input there's optional batteries so you can mix and match your power inputs you can transition from dc to battery to ac and back again without the router going down without any interruption and connectivity so you can get this thing rolled out anywhere you need it and then you can move it anytime you need to without having to interrupt that connectivity that whole top tray has a huge array antenna array in it so you've got really high quality antenna connectivity built right into that box you don't have to mess with you don't have to put tripods up or do anything to get this thing connected you just have to push that power button down let it boot up you're ready to go on the top there's a patch panel so you can map out lan ports or lan ports to those external ethernet ports so that you can maybe you've got a fixed line connection at the location you're at so you can map out a wan port to those external ports using that patch panel or maybe you need to hang up cameras or access points around your perimeter

managed services such as managed firewall or managed router however rolling a truck to install a new appliance for each new service is slow and costly that is why vcp a virtual managed services in other words delivering managed services using virtual network functions or vnf software loaded on a universal CPE device is so attractive in fact 70% of service providers surveyed by IHS market ranked its is very important or critical for producing new revenues successfully delivering virtual managed services can be complicated it requires integration of new technology skills and procedures if we take a look at the present mode of operations of a typical service provider we see the order processing is manual and piecemeal and there is manual handoff between the customer service rep engineering and operations via emails or manual paperwork a series of manual interventions are then required to configure the virtual environment and subsequently load instantiate and chain vnfs and vnf applications are then manually provisioned through multiple vendor specific air masses as a result the business impact can be as follows we see slow service delivery and revenue recognition complexity and vendor specific manual tasks hamper service innovation and agility lack of automation means increase topics and staff burden and errors result in unpredictable delivery times and missed commitments consequently service providers are in need of a modernized approach to managing the virtual edge one which has multi vendor vnf lifecycle automation and service chaining to improve service velocity and accelerate incremental revenue with streamlined order to service processes to optimize business efficiency staff productivity and reduce op ex and where automation accelerates the launch of value-added services to more quickly serve customers business needs and improve customer experience Blue Planet has an in telogen automation solution that can deliver this approach the Blue Planet virtual edge automation solution ensures msps realize the full potential benefits of nfe the solution provides tools that allow you to easily onboard new vnfs and design new network services that chain multiple vnf together it manages the full lifecycle from deployment in minutes on you CPE devices or centralized servers through software upgrades service outs changes and deletes and policy based auto scaling and healing resource adapters provide abstraction and mediation to easily support multiple VIMS such as siena DN f VI and OpenStack Blue Planet also supports the option to automate provisioning of the vnf application as well as the wide area network connectivity service between customer premises and cloud locations Blue Planet modernizes operations by enabling customer self-service fire a portal or alternatively order entry by a customer service rep allowing an order management system to submit an intent based order through an open API Blue Planet instructs the vim or DNF VI to create the virtual machine that will host the vnf we then instantiate the vnfs and provision the end to end service chain from the LAN through multiple vnfs to one uplink and then we optionally configure the vnf application such as setting firewall rules as well as the Metro access service as a results we expect the business outcomes to be as follows firstly to accelerate time to revenue by eliminating delays and errors associated with manual processes improving customer satisfaction with increased service control and visibility and reducing op X and staff burden now let's take a look at a deployment for a t1 service provider looking to resolve problems with service creation they were offering managed services delivered in the traditional manner with separate hardware devices for each service the ability to stock and spare multiple different hardware appliances was also costly and additional costs were seen rolling a truck to deliver a new service or upgrade to a higher capacity the challenge they faced was how can they reduce their managed service costs and at the same time increase their managed service offerings the reason for this is they were using hardware appliances to deliver those services each with his own vendor proprietary element management system EMS and methods and procedures for turning up the appliance when they first attempted to offer virtualized managed services with another solution they found it was difficult to onboard new vnfs and to manually configure the vnfs and the virtual switch to chain them together from the LAN side to the one side of the server so how did we help with blue planet and FeO we provide a method of creating new vnf descriptors to define the type of virtual machine a vnf needs and how to configure that vnf by simply thinning out a series of forms which are then used to generate that vnf descriptor VN FD we then provided a network service to script a wizard that steps you through the creation of an NS D to define how specific you VN s can be service chained together to define a brand new service offering the solution supports enhanced intelligent vnf and NS lifecycle management which automates the ability to add new VN F's into a running service or to upgrade an existing vnf as well as to auto scale or auto heal a vnf that has failed or is running low on CPU or memory capacity the outcome of this deployment was that the service provider had the ability to more easily create new services more rapidly and expand their offering this helps shorten the time to begin billing and generate new revenue the ability to keep the services running and modify services in a rapid way also saw an increase in customer satisfaction let's take a look at typical benefits of this approach order to service is accelerated for ads and changes from weeks to minutes we see an increase in revenue for value-added managed services by up to 20% and we see a reduction in process and network effects by up to 80% compared to traditional managed service delivery based on multiple hardware appliances you [Music]", "QxBDmA__rdA": "one of the major challenges that face our customers when bringing 5g handsets to market really lies around the antenna management when you think about it you're trying to add 5g to an already dense radio network where you've got Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and 4G ultra wideband already enabled and in today's handsets it's at very difficult to build a suitable antenna environment when it comes to managing all these signals around the antenna the antenna tuning and switching is paramount and the performance of it will really dictate the performance of the system we're looking forward later this year of bringing MEMS technology into this application they promises much lower loss a much higher quality factor to enable better performance overall in handset you", "tbLM85Yw1CE": "so let's just talk about how this works how 4g is different than 5g and what really what makes 5g so much faster and the short answer is there's no single answer to that question there's a lot of different things in play that together add up to 5g technologies promising capabilities on the far left we've got the spectrum so at the top you can see basically today's current swath of lte spectrum it's kind of centered around a little bit below one gigahertz to a little bit above three gigahertz 5g has opened up a lot of spectrum so there's just a lot more frequencies that can be used to deliver wireless services to to and so we're seeing that shift happen now we're starting to see the 4g spectrum gradually shift into 5g use and we're starting to see these these new frequency bands start to come come alive and be utilized on top of the the existing bands that were already in use so there's really three bands that people talk about there's millimeter wave this is super high frequency super high speed this is where you get that gigabit multi gigabit type of capacity but it's very short range it's very easily obstructed by trees walls those kinds of things so you know it's not really a mobility type of uh frequency at this point they it's going to take really really widespread deployment before the millimeter wave frequency is a realistic technology for mobility applications for the most part you'll see millimeter wave used in fixed type of applications to start with or you'll see you know stadiums and things like that where there's really high user densities that need all that capacity in one short little area so millimeter wave is at high frequency high speed but again it's going to take a long time to deploy that in a in a really ubiquitous manner now sub six that's below six gigahertz that's kind of uh usually there's two bands there that are kind of lumped into that sub six conversation and i think the main reason is because the sub 6 frequencies behave a lot like lte networks do today you've got basically the same antennas really similar technologies really similar ways to deploy it compared to the traditional lte networks but that sub six kind of mid band slice there's still a lot of new spectrum there again it behaves pretty similar to existing lte networks so it's that's an area where again you'll start to see a lot of early gains in the speed as those mid bands come online it's just giving you more channels to talk out on that 5g network with now that sub 6 that sub 1 gigahertz low band those are what carriers often call coverage bands those are the the bands that can reach really far in rural areas and penetrate deep into buildings so 5g on these spec on this spectrum is great because again it provides you that wide coverage but it's really kind of an incremental improvement in terms of speed those low frequencies there's not a ton more you can do with them so there's technologies here in the middle to make those that spectrum more efficient you've got massive mimo so you've got four by four or even more mimo so you can hear a little bit farther you can talk a little bit farther and you get a little bit more cleaner usage of the airtime but again that's an incremental game beam forming is kind of part of that that again helps the antennas just talk more efficiently back and forth to each other and focus their energy at the tower at the client which yields better data rates but again that's a more of an incremental improvement in speed versus a game changer and there's some underlying technology that just makes the encoding and kind of the technical ways that these towers and devices talk to each other a little bit more efficient as well 5g is also a lot more efficient and flexible so you can have really big channels and really small channels so you can have really small channels for iot devices and kind of keep them segregated give them much longer range but not kind of crowd the higher capacity higher throughput bands for other devices so carriers are going to have a lot more flexibility and control over how how they chop this spectrum up and how they utilize it another big attribute of the 5g networks again especially with the millimeter wave networks is densification those millimeter waves are you know city block level coverage it's not you know hundreds of feet you know it's not it's hundreds of feet it's not thousands of feet or miles or it's much smaller footprint so there's a lot more nodes required to provide that kind of ground level coverage so you'll see oftentimes you'll see the carriers activate 5g again on their lower frequencies right away so they don't have to deploy new towers necessarily to do that they might have to tweak something at this tower or that tower to turn that on but relatively light lift in terms of effort required to turn that on compared to getting bucket trucks out there and hanging poles on street lights all over all over your city blocks to get that that super high speed millimeter wave deployed so how can we use speed fusion with 5g what are some useful ways that this these two technologies can fit together first up bandwidth bonding so 5g is going to be a faster connection that that's kind of the the underlying promise there and again really the reality in a lot of scenarios comparing the same same situation from 4g to 5g 5g is generally going to be faster every time but again as these networks roll out you're going to have very wide variations in the performance you're able to get you know if you're in the urban core you might see those gigabit speeds or maybe several hundred megabits as you move out to the the more uh suburban areas and then as you get into the rural areas oftentimes you'll still see 5g performance maybe in that 20 30 40 megabit per second range so that sounds kind of like 4g speeds right and again those low frequency bands on 5g are really more of an incremental improvement they're not game changer type of speeds yet so as you you know especially in mobility applications as you're moving in and out of these areas you're going to have widely varying capabilities from those lte networks so that ability to do packet level bonding and aggregating throughput is still going to be really important especially in mobility applications now when we talk about hot failover again as you're moving between these networks and jumping up and down that ladder of capability and speeds you're going to have dead spots too right 5g does not just eliminate dead spots magically the carriers still have to put in a ton of effort and and resources to cover all these areas efficiently and so there's still going to be gaps right one network is still going to be stronger here than the other network is and so being able to seamlessly hand off between those networks is still going to be super relevant again especially in mobility applications now if we look at fixed applications you might be able to use a much faster more consistent 5g connection in a fixed location right you might be able to get access to that millimeter wave or just maintain really high speed you know 100 megabit plus type of connectivity so in those situations you might want to use 5g as a primary one or you might want to use it as a backup to like a high quality landline right backing up a high quality landline if you've got like a gigabit connection and rolling that over to maybe a 10 or 20 megabit lte connection that's not going to give you a great experience right if you've got 50 100 users on that wireline connection that single lte connection really isn't going to give them that same experience it's not really a useful failover in a lot of situations so being able to switch over from a high speed wire line to a high speed 5g that's still super useful right you can match that experience of that line connection and give you that seamless failover between the two two other speed fusion technologies we can talk about with 5g are land smoothing and bandwidth overflow so when smoothing the whole point of wan smoothing is to optimize the performance of real-time applications when smoothing is not targeted at peak throughput again your zoom call your team's call they don't care if you've got a gigabit connection they need like one megabit really consistently they need super low packet loss they need super low latency again it's all about the consistency that makes those real-time applications perform well so when smoothing you can do that you can optimize that you can make sure that you've got the most consistent usage on every single packet that goes out so that you can adjust to those variations in one link or another again 5g networks are going to have ton of capacity but there's still going to be little interruptions right the latency is going to be super low overall on these 5g networks but there's still going to be little little performance hiccups here and there as people do heavier and heavier applications on them so you're still going to see that need for protecting those real-time applications now bandwidth overflow is something we haven't talked a lot about publicly yet but this is a really great fit for for 5g and especially fixed location type applications oftentimes fixed location they already have some sort of wired connectivity and that's usually an unmetered kind of unlimited type of type of connection but oftentimes they've kind of maxed that out right if it's a dsl connection or a cable connection it's got its limits right maybe you've got a 50 meg dsl connection that does pretty well for the most part right you can do pretty much everything you need to but more and more as we're doing more and more zoom calls more and more online applications maybe that 50 meg just is kind of getting maxed out well with speed fusion bandwidth overflow you can still use that wire line circuit as your primary link but then you can burst traffic onto a wireless link or any link for that matter so you can have that unlimited always on wire line connection and again as as your users are demanding more and more bandwidth that go beyond the capacity of that single link you can burst onto that wireless link and so you're optimizing your costs you're optimizing your usage but you're still giving yourself that flexibility to have a higher speed experience so 5g has been talked about for a couple of years now several years actually so it's been a little bit frustrating i think for a lot of people right we keep talking about 5g we keep hearing about it but you know the reality is i still can't have it in my in my ambulance or i still can't have it in whatever application i'm trying to do maybe it's an autonomous car right we're still kind of stuck using 4g in a lot of cases but the really good news is this has given us time to prepare as a vendor right so in 2017 we already knew 5g was coming and so we launched our epx with modular capabilities so that we could upgrade that that router down the road as 5g and other technologies became available so we took that same thought process from our epx into our mbx and our sdx as we deployed more and more uh high quality products out there we made sure that we had that that upgrade path covered for those types of products so that they're really a long-term investment versus kind of a one or two-year kind of consumer cycle type product again we wanted to give customers that investment protection as 5g matured and became closer and closer to reality so now again 2020 those modules started to become available we were able to get our hands on modules get into labs start testing those modules and then later in q2 q3 we actually been able to carry out many pilot projects with our global partners and carriers so we can see in the real world how these things behave on the on the 5g networks and so again we're approaching that point where these modules are going to be carrier certified and then the routers will be carrier certified and so depending on your country depending on your carrier we are now accepting orders for these devices and again for the us the carriers aren't quite ready to accept these devices so you know it's not something you can buy right now and start rolling out but you can get first in line to get these devices as they do go through that approval process and in other countries you know it might be a lot easier to get get these rolled out on your carrier networks right now so you need to talk to your account manager at peplink to figure out what's available in your area what the pricing is on that and we'll show you in a little bit what options are available to start pre-ordering so we talked a little bit about kind of the road map and where 5g is right now but just to kind of recap right now especially in the us we're seeing 5g really widespread on those sub 6 frequencies all three major carriers have pretty large footprints on those those sub six frequencies we're also seeing simultaneous deployment of millimeter wave from those carriers again in the u.s i think the major carriers each have about 30 or so cities that they've got some level of millimeter wave coverage in that's not city-wide in most cases i don't believe but again you're starting to see this pop up more and more in the urban areas so globally there's a pretty wide uh pretty wide adoption of 5g but also quite a bit different focus from some carriers to the others so i think the us and china are probably the furthest along maybe south korea as well and you're starting to see europe and latin america and some of these other territories start to embrace the technology as well so we're really starting to see that momentum shift where almost everybody's got this deployed in some manner now and it's really not a matter of turning it on but improving it at this point", "DLrXYyqxsCU": "from which to create the script so I didn't have to create a lot of lines I just had to learn the lines

citizens businesses and society as a whole now and in the future Aliza 5g rise to a new level", "e2UOKYcpvGM": "[Music] I'm speaking with folky anger from Erickson about one of the key developments in 5g and that's the deployment of 5g core for standalone 5g so folk you can just tell us about y5g standalone deployments need a new core architecture yes sure if you look at the five-year course stand alone we have new network functions defined by three VPP so in order to have the architecture for the stand alone we need to deploy this new network functions like SMF AMF and so on and that is then in addition to the existing ones we have today for 5d a non-standard own operation or 4G operation now for 5g core Ericsson talks about needing to introduce a dual mode core what does that actually mean for mobile operators yep I mean it means that we can't serve our customers the operators with a core network that can handle existing EPC a volt packet core traffic defied the non standalone traffic and the 5g standalone it so the dual comes from supporting 4 D and 5 D at the same time for mobile operators are moving into the 5 g phase what do they need to have in place what do they need to introduce the 5g core because this is a very different kind of deployment to any other mobile quarter they've had before isn't that correct yep I mean that that's correct if we look at what is required from let's say infrastructure perspective is to be able to run cloud native network functions so you need a layer that can handle this kind of cloud native network functions for instance adding a container as a service layer in your indoor data center and also to have the the OEM capabilities in order to to manage also these cloud network functions in addition to the virtual network functions that are commonly deployed today also what's important and theories to have the possibilities to have the interworking between let's say legacy core network and the new capabilities that the five decor stand-alone brings for instance if you have certain capacity already today on your side using polling capabilities we can add capabilities also by introducing cloud network functions that inter work with the existing virtual or even physical the functions in the court so interworking is very important aspect but how can mobile operators be prepared and ready for the introduction of cloud native capabilities because that's something that's very new to mobile operators is there any way that this can be made quite seamless we can see examples already today where we have deployed with for instance two two operators Verizon and Telstra and if we take the case of Telstra what they introduce then is additional capacity by deploying a cloud native in their case it was an Mme adding that to the pool so I see it's similar when you add the five the core standalone that it's gonna be yes it's gonna be so that you need to have the sort of say the infrastructure the cloud the infrastructure in place in order to deploy this cloud native functions and at the same time we need to ensure that we have interworking that can be also for instance to have a continuous voice coverage throughout the network there will not be a 5d and noir coverage everywhere so we need from a code perspective to support for instance EPS fallback in order to have a continued voice service so yes there are a number of new things that we bring here with this clown net net cloud native network functions for the fiber core stand-alone at the same time though we need to ensure that from a from a user experience may it be a mobile broadband service or a voice that we have this kind of continuous coverage and that we sold by inter working between the different core core network functions and then for the mobile operators is not just about to new IT infrastructure but also about having new skills and new ways of working how can i Ericsson help the operators to adapt to a new set of operational procedures yeah I mean in order to to basically run this new network functions very efficiently we have invested in tools to help to help our operators to manage these network functions it is for instance the possibility to simplify the way you deploy software we call it software delivery pipeline where we have a number of automatic mating steps one example here is in order to really test that the software is working the way it's supposed to be we have something called automatic acceptance testing and also we're bringing up similar like we did on the virtual side also for the cloud native different kind of lifecycle management workflows in order to instantiate scale up scale down and also terminate cloud native functions and these are examples of how we help our customers to to run these networks more efficiently then there are obviously some benefits having cloud native network functions if you look at software upgrade then you can take smaller pieces of the application to do a software upgrade and avoid a large upgrade and that means that we can have even less interference during a software upgrade or basically no interference by doing in service oft where upgrade during day time instead of having let's say maintenance windows during night time so I think this is really a benefit also from an operator moving to more cloud native network functions so you mentioned that Verizon and Telstra have already demonstrated these new 5g chord of deployments and attributes one of the key things that Ericsson learnt from these early deployments there are a couple of learnings we have I mean first of all obviously it's great to have have it tested with a real traffic through through the networks in order to to see that the nodes behave like they're supposed to behaving the cloud native so get the characters there also we get feedback on on how these network functions or or operated so we can also get that feedback into our or Andy in order to further and haunts how you maintain and operate these network functions so it's I mean it's a great start we had had the cloud native Mme in commercial operations since December last year and we constantly adding more subscribers into that one so great start and when does our accent think we might see fully standalone 5g deployments might it be soon after the 3gpp released 16 specifications are completed I would say it will even count come now let's say from mid 2020 we expect to see the first commercial networks having five decor standalone in in operation we have some markets that we've been involved in extensive performance and field trials activities like China and South Korea so we foresee that the first five decor standalone let's say mid this year or quarter three this year we will start to see those going into operation in addition to these two markets we have more than 90 engagement with different operators around the world on five decor standalone so I anticipate there will be a few more launches beyond China and South Korea during 2020 and first it may be so that we see some deployment to target let's say the mobile broadband for consumer but we also see interest from having more kind of Enterprise tailored deployments to cover a certain area for a specific enterprise customer where five the core standalone brings additional benefit beyond what the existing core networks can do for instance where you have more possibilities to do slicing where we can further reduce the latency in the network so you're gonna see some mobile broadband deployments this year and also I believe we can see some enterprise kind of deployment and finally do you think operators will wait to see the experience of some of the early movers or do you think the mobile operator community already understands the benefits of 5g core capabilities I believe there is a general consensus about these capabilities that this new architecture brings if you look at setup times over let's say voice or data call and so on compared with a non standalone versus a standalone then some use cases may take a bit longer if you look at how fast the enterprise market will be served with five week or standalone I believe we vary between different markets we know in certain countries for instance where you have release dedicated spectrum for enterprise like in Germany this can come a bit faster so to your question yes very certainly they'll be facing some markets we'll take the lead and I believe it's a great opportunity to look at these places and take the learnings to two other before we see really a big rollout or five decor standalone I think there's a little doubt that the introduction of new standalone 5g core is one of the key trends that we're seeing in the mobile operator space this year and also finding out how operators are benefiting from the early deployments so for Kate thank you very much for talking to us about this today thank you [Music] you",

"H2Y-tQoJHkc": "in the infrastructure side in particular the ability to cover wide ranges of geographic spectrum and try to fit into the footprint of today's cellular network with these higher frequency ranges is going to be a challenge it will lead to advanced antenna systems phased array for sure and in some applications will need to be employed and then managing the overall power consumption within the device so you're talking about generating an awful lot of power and dissipating a lot of power in these devices so bringing very efficient amplification power amplification and

we see wide adoption of that in the infrastructure side of 5g you [Music]", "0LFq_DWq-pE": "Hi, I'm Joe Marsella, Vice President of\nProduct Line Management for Ciena's packet\nnetworking division. And I'm excited to be\ntalking to you today about our new line of 5G\nxHaul routers. We'll even be doing a brief\ndemonstration of the ability to aggregate a 10G client up\nto a 400G line. One of the big drivers\ngoing into 5G for operators is really around the need to increase bandwidth. What 3GPP calls eMBB or\nenhanced mobile broadband. This ability to\nincrease bandwidth not only affects\nthe UE, the RAN, and the core, but it\nhas a big effect on the underlying wireline infrastructure\nunderneath. The ability to support\nhigher bandwidth is not the only driver for\noperators to go into 5G. The ability to reduce the\nlatency to support new user applications like\nAR, VR and advanced gaming is another key driver. The other big driver\nin the industry is really around\nMachine-to-Machine in IoT. Each of these use\ncases is actually creating different physical\nrequirements on the network. Requiring us to look at\nthings like network slicing, to create virtual slices through a single physical\ncommon infrastructure. With all these\ndifferent use cases, it's having an effect on the underlying\narchitecture of how we build radio access networks. Today, majority of networks are building\nwhat's called a distributed RAN, or\nD-RAN architecture where the processing for\nthat radio is located, co-located with the radio itself. As we move to 5G, the increase in the amount of radios means\nit's no longer economically, or in some cases even\nphysically possible to collate, co-locate those resources\ntogether with the radio. So that leads to a split in the overall processing\nrequirements. The first between the\nRU and the DU, which is called the\nfrontal interface for applications that\nrequire less latency. And for the second split between the DU and the CU for\napplications which are able to handle a little\nbit more latency can be somewhere between\n70-80 kilometers away. The next big trend is really\naround virtualization, whether it's a D-RAN\narchitecture or C-RAN architecture,\noperators are looking to take advantage of the ability to disaggregate software from hardware and run\nthat software in a common compute\nstorage location. With all these in mind, we believe mobile network operators, or MNOs, will ultimately\nseek packet routing solutions that deliver to them\noperational efficiencies, CapEx savings, as well as increased service velocity for competitive differentiation. So the new 5G portfolio has five key enhancements over previous generations\nof technologies. The first is around high-scale\n25 GE aggregation, for locations that really\nhave a high degree of radios and need that\nextra degree of power. The second one is really around the ability for the\nfirst time to aggregate those connections up\nto 400 gig interfaces, where 100 gig and 200 gig is\njust simply not enough. The third is really around\nthe ability to support xHaul capabilities.\nCPRI, eCPRI, both front hall, mid hall\nas well as backhaul, all within the same platform. The fourth gets into the idea of network\nslicing and the ability to support hard slicing and\nsoft slicing through flexible Ethernet, as\nwell as segment routing. And then the fifth,\nwhere locations that are really\nsensitive to latency, we can introduce things like time-sensitive\nnetworking to really optimize the latency\nrestrictions on the network. In this demonstration\nwhich seeks to simulate a 10 gig\neCPRI interface, run it over a 400 gig\nline side interface. We've taken a 10 gig test set, tied it into the 5166, aggregated it through\nthe fabric to a 400 gig QSFP-DD interface,\nlooped it back, then put it back through the test set. And you can see on the\ntest set here that it's all green and running live. So in February of 2020, we announced a new\nline of xHaul routers. All come with a common\n800 gig fabric. They're built for\nhardened enclosures and all support sync and GNSS\ntiming capabilities. The first in that\nfamily, the 5164, has thirty-two 1, 10, and 25 gig\ninterfaces that can be aggregated up into four\n100 or 200 gig line side interfaces. The second in that family, the 5166, is the same basic\nprinciple as the 5164. But instead of four\n100 gig interfaces, we have two 200 or 400 gig interfaces for locations that need the\nhigher degree of bandwidth. And the final member\nof the family, the 5168, is the same as the 5164,\nbut with additional programming capabilities which allows us to support 18 ports of\nCPRI for the transition from 4 gig to 5 gig\nfor radio operators. 5G promises significant\nperformance updates over existing\n4G LTE networks. To realize these\nperformance benefits, we need to upgrade\nthe wireline network. The Ciena portfolio\nof xHaul routers is designed specifically\nto help operators upgrade their wireline\nnetwork to take advantage of the growing\nmove to 5G networks.", "XNhAxMLqmCk": "[Music] yes

everybody know I said pry Moria is super strong thank you telling what I do but my point was my point was Lauria fell down from his pedestal that was that was the whole point of the video so okay he fell down why do you think he was up there in the first place because he say they say Oh to say point blank this dude was duking it out with Cairo at the beginning of the pirate cruise okay this guy but like he's not trash like basically basically Moria got destroyed and with the press cuz you know it's it's it's like dude it's Luffy goes up Tokaido and the kaitos large the rest of the straw hats except for Luffy you think we're just gonna be gung-ho and go back to trying to be in The Pirate King no he's not Luffy got my idol right now used to trying to his friends got sliding oh he thought his friends did slaughter win cool ass slap the hell out everybody they died because it's not like Moria where they indicated like I don't probably do something like cut their heads off okay voters what's your 2900 we gotta get 29 wait I'm gonna take you back on the saddest being people I got you so 29z boy sent tomorrow it's just like a joke this Canaveral is the the guy with the big eggs the one however you spell the one that was up in on 100 sure are Dodie oh shoot tomorrow tem ma are you okay get in ain't it so close yeah let me change my loose I mean I changed my lives but change the naming of it oh my my uh my 29 is de boy Jack be drought okay so I'm gonna put lac on uh that's why he's a little whack the well I mean whack is still bad but I get what you're going for Wow that means I got a W in his name whack I'm tired of everything what's your 28 Sabo law oh yeah what you mean Oh roaches will be that low just because I want to see more from him I'm giving him the chance to be on their list Papa's not 30 but I want to see him do more than just of our ghosts that is uh it's all thanks write their name Kurosaki's and sake but man he let her slap him mm-hmm let's not like it you got a hand here Lou yeah I even get some from slap don't like crash but uh before I see money yes it just saying that my 29th movie was swapped out for Hugh tomorrow and she's off the list completely okay 28 is Jack bedroom predict refix mister lack are my boys e what's going on with it this 28 my Kanye is docu o ex strong motor what was yours lack yeah my 29 was lack mi-28 is gonna be an L okay really the Thunder God himself yeah Jack has a pretty good fruit and like skillset but if an L was introduced in a new world he easily be a super strong second commander or first commander and somewhat an inlet Akali curry uncle crew or something like this those overconfident low gears which he infinitely but I feel like he was in a new world instead of back in you know before even paradise he would have you know had a humbling experience to to you know getting smacked up by how to curries future side yeah I mean we haven't we haven't seen him get like load if yet like Luffy was putting his all into it if someone nam because of now if you if he wasn't so arrogant he would have just covered Luffy in that goal completely in suffocating in the death so it was like he could have killed him don't sleep on I know cuz don't remember he can basically make some Goku's that you out of lightning just because of his overconfidence he's gonna like get bested just that's what I'm saying like you would do that in a new world get low dipped and then he would change his personality as all I'm saying like I agree what you're saying I'm just saying after that he would not be he as in Elish you know what I'm saying mmm-hmm yeah like so who are still 27 for Sabo what's going on basically guys I'm gonna tell you right now everything from 2027 and up is all jumbled up because you guys got a bunch of characters I forgot so ya may use X plea well I was gonna happen to me by just one online look of every strong character I could and just  looking there God leave my hello people like when I first made the list it was ridiculous so who's your 27 my yeah okay yeah about 27 is Edward evil you know I'm gonna be was a character have every right to and he was in what three or four panels yes pedestal is that you know he's track he's trying to kill all the white blue parts he the fact that he's confident I don't think he's like a strongest Marco chosen but like he's confident enough but he's able to Kim know guys like jozu guys like Marco guys like Lisa so like just with just the fact that he's that confident in this and his abilities tells me that he's really strong so right now I'm putting them at 27 and also since he was said to be as strong as young white beard and I know this is young white beard but young white beard still gonna be pretty strong right yeah I definitely believe that one we but at the same time I don't think he all right so y'all remember at the beginning the marine for when like white beard stepped up on the scene clean his and it's made a whirlwind just by slashing his by sent oh do you think weevils on that level because I think white beard did that without the devil truth like he did based form that is because like we've seen hockey like Luffy he's rubber but he's using them lightning in half stocky both he and category use fire enhanced hockey can we well yeah but what cows he's rubber how is he gonna be using a lightning attack command yeah but you can't say his lightning hockey because you can speculate he's like a hockey because Murray also had playing monkey and they only end we've got Red Hawk and they only use those attacks when they have hockey on their hands I mean almost everyone can do fighter attacks and one piece fire attacks is nothing special may not be so Sanji did it pre Township so was that hockey and big mom did it when she was rampaging against Scott Scott you just punch in the ground on the lighting email yeah oh oh oh oh thank you for that that that just adds more used to my theory about elemental forms okay that's cool me mad that definitely think big mom got something else going on besides just you know her fruit and regular hockey cuz daunting any of her other hockey's a regular the only thing I can say is her observation haki didn't like jump out at me like every other thing she did that's like the only thing she's here because if when he said that we would have just the whole rest of the combo would have been dead Thanks alright uh who is next Izzy boy with 2727 yeah so John Wolfe who Oh San Juan okay sir John I was like who's John Wolfe Sam come on you gotta give Sam one respect because he's one of the Charles Giants in history but San Juan he got a dumb fruit that kid it was shoot them up to 580 meters you gotta respect that right yeah I mean at the same time there's like been proof that Giants don't do well in battles with top tiers they might like chopped up pretty much Giants ain't never use talking right there to tries to disrespect all the keeps on telling us about these races that are strong right so the diet they're never wrong like what the fishermen are always to become stronger than normal human but the fishermen like our line was cool but like man like this like that I feel like that document guy he was thought Don Kraig's crew could have been given our long and run for his money like our long was weak like really weak it was cool but he was weak yeah he didn't know hockey I don't think he really used fish man karate which was like her could be in the fish man so it was like he kind of squandered his fish man Mnet's is he just had a cool story that he didn't even hockey up so it broke and so my 27 70s missed a boa and ikkaku because she be people with it I know that's and she got Congress hockey and cuz like even John to jail with his Congress hockey prime to jail made GARP struggle I feel like not for long but he did I feel like Garth would do the same thing to do flamingo it's like chin chow I feel like privacy job was like more or less strong as doflamingo but or Jim Bay or something like that maybe we didn't do Flamengo but strongest eBay but for all practical purposes the weakest person we've seen with concur sake is defeat and we all know how strong they fear so you guys with khakhras hockey yo flame yeah you ain't saying much as Eva and in these pics it's like I'm trying to figure out I was trying to figure out some some stuff with this recording software but yeah I'm good number hey let's let's just attempt to get to 15 yeah what's 26 for Sabo hmm yeah factor peckerwood okey I agree bacala dad oh oh no bro come on like cracker was good yes but that utility of dough fee crazy I don't think record was awakened utility only take you so far no but there was a theory he's not a waiter oh wait there was this theory though yeah hating the biscuits from the ground because if you look at the manga panels it actually does Loki look like the cracker on parts are like they're coming from the ground and he's forming them into crackers so some people are making an argument cracker was awakened because he was taking the crackers out of the ground I had cracker basically I have cracker hand I have cracker doflamingo Bowa Hancock and Catarina d-von all at number 30 but since we can't do ties really I only have one tie cuz I really couldn't decide there but since I have I don't want to have a five-way tie at number 30 I just put the mussels honorable mentions it's pretty hard but at the same time I don't know about half those people being at 30 but to each his own Yvonne is 30 because her doll fruit because of her double fruits potential it's got the potential to basically manipulate every single element we've learned of and to be able to create literally illusions so perfect but you can live in the illusion world forever why relies you're there so basically her devil fruit as a kitsune devil fruit and all the things I've listed it's a mythical xoan and all the abilities I've just listed are the potential abilities of the Ksenia she's would be you would be able to shadow jump she would be able to me as I said allegiance so I only put out thirty because of the potential her the duffel troop has not because of any facts you know other gnomes they usually only have like one special power right but instance and since ad Yvonne did that shape-shifting thing I'm thinking that wasn't shape-shifting it was her illusion ability so I think she's gonna fight mostly with illusions and that actually worked perfectly with Nami because we know Nami likes to use illusions as well cool so so that I feel like when they fight the black pirates Devon and army are gonna be having an illusion battle so at that point it won't even be necessarily Nami has to be stronger than Devon she just has to I mean well I mean I mean Lee but Nami has Zeus if she out illusions Devon and hits her with Zeus late twice the most factional tough dirty dough is mine though the guys and crew 26 now yeah mu which is 26 bro 526 is the good ol lucky really mr. fat meat hey let's go let me room in blue what wait what was it to 2016 oh no wait don't okay I'll put dinner on that fast my 26 in a a little low it's what y'all need to know though these people on top very loud and be kind of close together you know no one is top dirty is like I'm saying that they're super weak compared to this person you know it could literally be like when it could be like 2% last week or something you know and it's funny because I actually have smoothie next mats that's awesome I feel like I have to put her in because she's a second commander and is like you respect the rank but at the same time she's gonna be under some people that kind of don't make sense only because she's like counted that trash right now so for me my 26 and smoothie let me repeat this smoothie a second division commander is crying out somebody do something by the way some of the guys guys some of the guys I have a Skype I just imagine them but just saying I think something's like as strong as yak you think big mom say commander is as strong as Kai toaster commander no no no I say that is because like what it seems to be vulture is the more commander's you have the more like their weaknesses spaced out so like the black be upon our black cream the wipe your privates like ease oh he's not gonna be fighting a guy like King right but I fit since the Beast put like the last command the strength is so the Beast pirates their command like their third commander is going to be stronger than big mom pirates earth man because they have less commanders see what I'm trying to say I mean to be honest bro smoothie should be top five you know I'm saying top 5 best people in it I mean because she cost moody for a reason you know she's gonna slip that bad boy up she's up there a raid you sure I'm sure I forgot to spill that I'm taking yeah so shoot amaru over cracker that's interesting why okay so you think because he beat Jack or or the TV slash neck you'll be able to be cracker yeah you guys forget this jack mat-su tomorrow he matched in a rocky nekima luffy tank the elephant hit always oh oh oh he's hybrid form which is the strongest form so far I wasn't stained blue I wasn't saying shoot tomorrow beat Jack I'm just saying I'm thinking of what Szabo's thinking I'm trying to see where he's getting logic pump and I don't think I don't worry dude all right my list isn't over all right sorry wrong person I got the mix of sorry I have you kuma without this brain right now well kuma with his brains I forgot his bean until he said that quick question do you all think that he can use hockey since he doesn't have his brain no idea I forgot he lost his brain well not my whole listen they say you say kuma cuz he has no what waited brain just like come Oh what what's his brain but since we can't think that was brain just like my 25 is Orochi Oh bro she hey now it's just voter right yay well true oh my god yeah I got my gym I think a defeat what well hey oh no I always do that bro that's when your father is Magellan okay hey I can't respect to that even though I'm I did not hear that cheer emojis fell asleep I bet when it comes back he's gonna be so mad he missed it and I think I do think that he um yo yes me straight nice up and being here I don't know where he is I mean they come drew I couldn't I couldn't fill it they loose real quick they just got here quick and then I want to like argue with them huh it was on Orochi my jealous yay please I don't [Music] wanna have a tit man Brad I'm either pause this recording see if I could pause this um what's your 20 force over shabu shabu shabu shabu I didn't know I didn't know if y'all could give me you know so Lucy Peck oh that is interesting is she I'm not gonna lie to you I'm trying to see where this is going I'm excited blue yeah I just done some sob up looking at your list for too long pineapple I know you want to go in but we could talk about bullying in but you got boa over a row Chi just fine that just real quick that's easy what who me yeah the bowl what the floater oh gee well right now I think in the end or else you'd be stronger I just want to see more from him so like I'm good I'm granting him like a number 30 spot but I thought you should even be like I both the people I've even listed right now but I just know where to put them exactly so I just put them at number 34 now I kind of agree that's kind of why I did - yeah I would hope he's strong older yeah at least because like you give this guy a mythical zone that were ferreira them logia like he has to have some sort of high competence yeah so a blue what sugar 24 oh that hurt hello 24 words and I came here with Queens the Queen what which is 24 Zboard my plan for her I got back on my list my 24 is King their king their queen great oh my my 24:4 is cracker I'll ring it up we moved on to 23's or what yeah I'm 23 Babu you I see he knew and you got hired right for them bro there will be no fee what's going on yeah so so did you put them over each other just because you didn't want to put them in the same spot yeah I think they're equal in strength yeah meet me too I figured blue 23 Mach 23 is good old saddle what I would have liked it to be a little higher but I 23 just like Saitama said 20 words a list when t 3 to 17 I said I have note that said Oh first mates are more or less equal I'm just ordering them because I have to but isn't really a first mate this guy's this guy's transmits outside we basically first makes the revolutionaries yeah but then you would have to say that dragon is equal to like the power Bianco and it's snow down here okay I'll pretend I didn't hear that but then you have to say me back all the other commanders he's got a army as strong as Yahoo problem stronger than the Aqua crews more members although so who is the second and third in command that is matching a yonkos level because I see Sabo fighting the first commander but I don't see I feel like Kara Sabine commander dude yeah and then like morally and Lindbergh bellow Betty like those are like morally he looks wrong since he's like the only low he's the only Giants even hinted to be strong with the devil fruit in hockey and stuff so and then like mmm Lindbergh he's like a crazy event there apparently it's like he's kind of like invent he's kind of an inventor like what we kind of expected them Beckman to be so like all of them are gonna be pretty strong because these guys remember they're fighting the world government are different fronts their commanders fighting the world government on different fronts that means the world government's gonna send their like vice-admiral candidates to become Admirals at them and they're still around like they're strong they're strong but I don't know they're as strong as you're giving them credit to be but we only twenty where's lists so z-boy what is your touch oh my 23 9 23 I keep accidentally going out the screen I'm trying to look up who these characters are yeah I've got he looks pretty high on katarina debug the looking I mean sometimes I think to myself like what am i doing what am I saying yeah feel it katarina Dave on 23 I got along what wait hold on hold on spectrum engine do you have a powdery - Dave on over kaido's first commander you can't talk about anybody bro you got lava crackers over my jelly magellan oh thank you take las frutas break easy if you don't know what he does Nilo gives you what do you mean have what does cracker doing to a melon nothing well why is cracker on Magellan you have milk he has multiple cracker Magellan's if he can poison loki is if you don't know hockey Magellan like washing crack cracker knows hockey and he can create multiple biscuit soldiers but like prick like pretty much have all of his uh like Magellan's poison not do anything to him because poison effects like the the nervous system and all these other stuffs cracker quarters don't have that so you spewing all your poison a time they just walking through that I can't because Magellan isn't fast and he cracker has low durability but Magellan doesn't have the highest either because he challenged awakened in May I mean it is too slow and hockey could probably do some to food if you like fast and have hockey with a good fruit you can definitely overcome a jello yeah let's go Bobbo Wester 22 okay black I'm making sure like I'm literally if y'all see it when I put a family despite their lack blue Phoenix with is your 20 to show you love really feel it the boy what's it the Phoenix you wallet oh man lots of respect here not get a lot of here they do of Zeebo boy 22 I don't know how to say this name easily but basically his name kind of sounds similar DeLuca L a FF I'll be here the demon sheriff don't like it he looked supposed to be a French dude he's the fee thing I think really is the feet maybe so so so Z boy are you still going with all these dudes on Blackbeard's crew over King just making sure yeah man all right when I had created his list Blackbeard had just show up again and had low dip Moria so that's probably what happened so what I'm saying is you didn't even bother to redo your list for this week it wasn't long ago man not that not that much as I might get a lot of a lot heat this one but i'ma put Coomer at number 21 wait we doing 20 months actually no I'm switching it I'm switching it hold on I got we still is on 22 my bad I was looking ahead sorry um I'm switching long Coomer I put law of Okuma still his cracker kuma and in law okay you better say all this stuff and then you're gonna go up to me you're gonna say that same prime Lauria it's a strong at least the drunks doflamingo is crazy then you're gonna put law over Zorro and like over cracker well Lock and Load if crackers ability because all cracker all he does is make it hard for you deal with multiple enemies law literally has a room where he's God and he can do as many people as he wants and he can probably it's not kinda fine him in his own me the guy who gave him this fruit and trainer since he was a kid I understand why he lost if you can't I don't tell you if he face anyone else that don't know what he can do in detail like like don't worry crazy you see like plot armor you got because we think about it so for like okay someone like fujitora couldn't break doflamingo birdcage strings doflamingo had some like minor plot armor there himself so it was like he's crazy to begin with like that fight was crazy I wouldn't put someone like old cracker would do so much better against law then like anyone else like law could be cracker I really don't see how you can't see it well well don't be different though because like his bird cage is unbreakable but if fujitora morning he could just attack doflamingo instead of trying to get out of the birdcage he destroyed well it hasn't been said that his bird cage indestructible like I don't think there's anything is indestructible besides probably Bartolomeo cage I mean his his his shield thing because that's like the purpose of it but uh that's just I don't know man I just think law does that do his fruit is crazy he like number one I can respect it 21 for subbu oh what's your 20 - what are you cleaning - vulture about 22 is lost kuma so I just switched long kuma so is coma for Clinton coma is 23 loss 22 okay thank you cuz I was like my bet 21 Phoenix would it is my 21 my 21 is I know I said no god this is my only time cuz I really could not use the because all these guys are like suppose 100 people in the tie was like three or four people we're just well in this two are twenty twenty one is just two and that would be the goofy and K Oh dad that's interesting tell you I'll see you later I I can definitely see how you think they're tired I'm cool with it 21:01 luffy and kid wait wait we can yeah I have I had one cut cop with Zorro Sanji because they're neck-and-neck if not you can see that Otis kind of making Luffy and Kidd parallels right now so like and I an asteroid og and now it's reducing but the cat the big cat and dog you could put you could you you probably could like split them up to and one because they're basically the same person so 21 for Z boy what's going on go drag the drag queen himself man Oh  uh I forgot his name a conundrum his name Ivanka von Cobb at number 20 I don't know what the is happening in the history over Queen over but like he's the commander level like I feel like he's not a commander necessarily in the Revolutionary Army I feel like I feel like you know I know he's a commander but if you could wind up a headliner in the Beast pirates like the committee level no no I'm saying like like you could put it below coming into Louisville I know what you're saying like you're putting him like the hell out is a right below the commander's game he was barely beating like he was fighting neck-and-neck with robot kuma who wasn't in control of himself and couldn't use his full powers anymore no no he wasn't completely turned into a robot at Marina for was he no he wasn't so he didn't have the Popoff for anymore when he's a robot but it's just like the Papa fruit it's like as controlled as his lasers so he who am i a marine for was weaker than cool man through the bark okay I can see he lost his mind at that point he lost the capability of hockey and knowledge okay cool yes but I don't that that whole of on Hoffa will defeat and half the universe I don't know about it but over king-queen Orochi bro yeah man can you get behind that Sabu if you can and you know what I may just be tripping people are gonna say that King beat the whole big Hong crew he snuck up on them and ambushed them but just the fact that he was able to conceal them stuff from very undoubtedly observation haki that well you gotta respect that Lily you have to respect that if I'm carve isn't gonna be doing that if he tried to like do you a death wink them off the waterfall he would have gotten like he could do I'm saying that you know they started coming oh my god what happened that people are saying that King went and he just came from afar what happened was they would go weekly work on the waterfalls if they were in the most vulnerable position where they're like at a almost like a 75 degree angle or something and then king but burst out and he came at them and he shoved them off and he flew away so basically they had enough time to see him but not react yeah 21 although we all break in that let's be honest oh no I was saying my 21 is doflamingo oops he has like a couple asked about being the main one is like he doesn't actually laugh he just like under his breath just I think he's really like laughing at you like you ain't then he actually laugh that's when you know you up it's all bad sob oh what's that 20 looking like pots of curry and Ozzy boy 2020 is Marco muscle so you put mark with 30 move everyone down yeah you know one replace them okay so just leave a roach it there you for now or what yeah okay cool my 20 is nice look is it so do ya there is Queen 420 what is your it was you're a nineteen so if you confuse me is it making it funny oh we're happy money my twenty is Queen and we're going on a 90 now what's all those who blue katakuri they both had caught a curio 20 yeah Sabah was in nineteen so what you got nineteen so and wait wait hold on wait wait I got a pause every everything in the vicinity key Oshiro is over katakuri yeah like recording Wow broke it alright I know we're trying to do this fast but I really got to hear why Kyosho Rose beating future Simon credit lists the big mob because it was introduced later that come on common sense you obviously not stronger than like a young black come on yeah like as the Shonan reason I really have to like no because I don't understand it's different it's like kill show he's strong he's gonna be really strong but it's it's not like he's I feel like he's gonna be one of Zorro's power-ups but not zones final opponent he's strong but I don't think he's gonna be taking out the Onkel commanders is that to a hot key like what so he's he's over first commander or the yes like I feel like and because that means Zerona luffy would have to be around the same strength like type levels no we we did this whole this was like where they are l because if him no but he's not sort of final opponent I think he's gonna be absorbed stepping-stone how do you know that we don't know I don't know that he's not presented as a final boss like the guys presented as possible final bosses for Zorro are like kyoshiro he's not even portrayed to be stronger than the commander's Kyosho remember he went and asked Queen discern and assassins he was commander of his own guys right but he's going around asking for things I got 18 so we're not really I'm on it my name's kid wait wait wait wait I'm crazy for having these that nineteen but you got kid immediately supernova nineteen the queen of dopey kids are ugly so we know female here's the problem bro here's the problem Magellan is solo this man this dude in jail and disrespect is wild man 20 where's all I'm saying yes he hasn't been shown hockey yet that's all I'm saying so he bumped down a lot just said yeah he found it yeah this restraining comes right now the stream Immokalee know my pain was factual blue Saba Wilshire 18 King my team is King as well boy my team is category I can respect that but I still can't respect you got has emerged just over King but me I died Barry Hey number 17 Sabo yeah which is wait wait wait Luffy oh oh Luffy nah my mother's ever again Lucia z-boy 20 words or less fam when we feel our rage at somebody else's while well up just try to digress and push it down and save it for a heated discussion on discord I just don't know why you couldn't Luffy down like that like when he got mad plumber and - he's a suit of armor - you know he's just like his poor armor his healing somebody figured out I don't know how I didn't before but his his same healing it's probably just this rubber body stretching to UM cover stuff up and heal okay I see boy go off on him come on you went off on me cuz kid was there 19 I'm just I'm just hydro I'm just like it's not mad it's just one piece I'm not no no I didn't say man I was saying like let him know why kids should be over King but I guess you don't agree with it but I think it is over King I just I don't agree but I'm there you go people think kid is like God above kata Korea he's above kata curity right now the both 400 and kata curatu I see I say both katakuri you know yeah lufia yeah Luffy Louie yeah I mean exactly he shouldn't be but you just put him there you say he is above first commander level and you know he really didn't win that fight straight out so you got help from barn you was still stronger than no flamingos at the end no doubt about it it's all the hope you got he doesn't though if you would have died if they were in a room and your four friends because a nice story is written he is ya know this is the top 30 with list not who was doing what overall from what we've seen yeah Mar 17 is Merkel the Phoenix Park lead boy which is 17 I keep in my bed I'm Saba Sabo but I can respect that talk to my boys are okay wait our YouTube channel was thank you Sabo I said my seventeen with Marco me invoker both got Sabu okay what's their 16th number yeah he said what's your sixteen moat well I can see why you say that if if she's post times defeats were cannon but they're not so on the lowest Kiki whoa where I'm ticklish Hey for my 26 I'm taking off smooth bro come on man we can't do this you know what and you're not 15 and we're on sixteen right now so oh oh so it's gonna be a part two it is yeah not tomorrow but it'll be soon yes right soon for the people wise and their energy up any other people might watching the stream make sure you leave a like make sure you subscribe you know there's gonna be a part two we're gonna stop at 15 so make sure to strive everybody here give me a whole chain wait can I say my number 60 yeah go ahead bro my number 16 is or okay my number is a roach chief and I think he's Admiral level I think he's about Australia's food tour because there's difference between Admirals like marine for exact Azuki and then admirals like fujitora right now all Admirals are equal so that's right we're specifically saying I think he's like more or less strongest fujitora because as I said Luffy is gonna be stronger not stronger he's gonna be younger level at the end before I know in my opinion as always he's gonna be on a different level than other first commanders since he's gonna be he's gonna be the sword God or the greatest swordsman in the world or something so I feel like he's gonna like progress faster so I think he gonna be I think he's gonna be as strong as from unit aura like that kind of emerald the weaker side of armor level at the end of 100 so z-boy will know north gonna like have to fight a bunch of smaller guys I don't no even what you said before might be right like if kyoshiro is like a strong sk curry if he beats hero like he beat somebody look it's weaker than beats kyoshiro and then after that he puts his all on the line to beats Orochi something like that z-boys for the love of God what is your sixteen the gravity master himself hey I'll a part of that in our private voucher nice well of Sabo for six people at Marco here yeah my my my Oh 6215 sabha music scene Sabu no you know you forgot Sabbath and I said Marku okay so 1500 man bro yo I hope for Lucci dang you're not using the movie man what's your 15 my 15 is the man the myth the legend and the blind legend the blind man and the blind to miss fujitora Z boy what is your 15 15 is a Vista hey wow we're sorry my 15 I got King the king I get that but so we end in the stream now and doing a part to relax how we are not right now or you go right no no I'm saying are we are we not because I said if notice a voter said we might but if we don't if we don't I'm gonna have to dip it like number 13 or something okay I mean we could do a part to do y'all want wanna like but not even this weekend like Mabley to do it okay and then you just sit in one of our st hild ass in it and with your Finnish knob and man would I think Butler you and I can just get so we can just get it hello this man right here me oh my bag so kick my Barrett I was just paying in that weekend leader I mean he like all the lists breaking up blue Sint when his listings finished it up I'm okay well by now okay well guys I guess well I guess that's a good sound that we probably have a part to make sure you go sub the Szabo make sure you go to blue pineapple and vulture I promised his mic isn't not always like this usually he has like cuz I looked at his stream it's pretty great you know he has like a like a good background good music in the back and I like the way set up Sabo got some good stuff too powerful got some good ideas I gotta check out some more solid wheels but I know he's doing some good stuff you got some good stream ideas and me in the future I'm planning on but bro I'm doing my oh man I just came back I can hear you my bad oh I don't either done done no no I was saying that blue can just one of y'all the list and then we can just finished like that that's what I was trying to say the whole time okay well get out guys all right so blue is he still here yeah it's probably talked to his mom parlor go-to person okay we'll wait when he gets back just someone tell them to like sin money all the list and we'll just finish like that Deku I'm in it okay so yeah finish it out don't discredit lately finishing it up or not wait you can't hear me no yeah well it won't be lagging oh my since I'm recording it it'll just be I'll just edit it so when we say a can you hear me was it that oh cool I guess hello y'all y'all here Lee up on y'all recording but I don't hear no leg you know yeah its head out okay bro just uh make sure that sinned just type just type the rest of your list in the discord Jeremy oh can you skin Sabo yep okay so that's a blue oh yeah okay guys technical difficulties you know I don't know what happened to them like I said don't discredit all the stuff I said earlier you know make sure to check out their stuff make sure like to start stay tuned for part two and I'm safe and I'm Sena I'm planning on having a jiraiya versus Iowa strange blueberries see ya man peace kuru since oh yes you better be good for me bro I [Applause] my name is be my my do not just cut a muscle legging right now yeah so in so we must steal like that am alright yeah do dislike another part or whatever yeah I might just a to the last part I kind of like because like the bank is what I was doing interesting is like since I had a screen recorder I have pulled up technical difficulties images on my screen so I'm gonna probably hit it out the part when I'm couldn't well it's not obvious so I could just in like that dog does okay now everybody breaking up", "orjplJpTZis": "[Applause] 5g is the evolution of wireless networks the next generation it has three major changes from previous generation networks its encompassing all networks becoming the network of networks using licensed and unlicensed spectrum to deliver data secondly it uses different frequencies than in the past both the low frequencies that are used today and also very high frequencies 28:38 even 60 gigahertz will be encompassed in this network and finally it changes the fundamental network architecture employing cloud and virtualization to make a network more efficient 5g will deliver things to consumers in a way that is faster than in the past and at a cost that is lower than the past", "ATYtN6xB-hs": "hello and welcome back to the course on call flows uh this is the last section of the course and is probably the most important one because here we will put together whatever we have learned so far in terms of network functions the associated services and the service operations all together and see how they all work in conjunction with each other to deliver 5g services we will be covering uh some specific common call flows within the 5g network and those namely are the registration the t registration the service request and the service request would be covered in two flavors we will cover the ue requested service request or ue triggered and then we will also cover the network triggered service request in this section so let us start this section the first call flow we will cover is the registration call flow and let me get my later so registration procedure the registration is the first procedure the ue performs after power on or in case if it is coming from say a 4g coverage to a 5g coverage so in that case also the ue will perform a registration message other scenarios where registration procedure is used are the initial registration that we referred to here power on and then there is a periodic registration this is kind of similar to what we had in the 4g world which was called the tracking area update procedure so rather than calling it a tracking area update procedure 5g refers to it as the periodic registration procedure and then we have the mobility registration this is also similar to the tracking area update procedure but this would happen say when you move from one tracking area to the other tracking area so just to elaborate a little bit on this concept so you have your network and say you are in a tracking area indicator which is your identifier for your tracking area one and then you also have another tracking area indicator that is identified by two so if a ue is here in this tracking area uh identifier identified by one after a given amount of time that timer is given by the amf to this ue as part of the initial registration the ue is required to periodically update and perform the registration process and that is what is called the periodic registration process similar to what we had the periodic tracking area update in 4g now the other scenario which can be where if this subscriber moves into a tracking area indicator identified by the value 2 here it has to perform a mobility registration registration process and it will still perform the registration process but here the cause will be the change in the tracking area because it has moved from one to two okay then the other scenario where a registration process will happen will be in case of emergency registration this is used by the ue when it wants to use emergency services in your ngram the next generation ran so as we discussed we noted the differences and the similarities between the usage of tracking area update process and the registration process we will review the steps in detail now for this process this picture here shows the different steps involved in the registration process and this gives you a overall view and then in the next couple of slides we will take a look at each of these sections i have labeled them as 1 2 3 4 all the way to 9. so as you can see these look familiar we have the user equipment we have the radio access network we have the access mobility function and we can either have a new amf an old amf as part of the registration process say in the scenario where the user is coming into a coverage which is served by the new amf and is no longer served by an old amf in that case you will see both these entities and we had talked about this in the services section uh that we were talking about the different uh service operations uh on specific to amf then we have the session management function uh the policy control function and the authorization user subscription function and we have the unified data mediation function so initially when the ue sends a registration request the radio access network uh selects the amf the access mobility function that needs to be used for processing of this registration request now this can be based on a couple of key points the amf selection it can be based on the requested network slice selection assistance information so the ue as part of registration request will send your network slice selection assistance information right it will send what is called a requested so it there is the r stands for requested and then the ran can use uh an amf that is capable of uh delivering the network slice that this user wants to connect to so we saw this uh initially uh when we were looking at the network slice selection function uh as well so it can uh so that that's where the uh the network slice selection assistance information is used by the ran if if it has the knowledge it can select a amf based on that if it does not have the knowledge in that case it will just send it to the default amf which has been configured in the ran and then the ran will work with the network selection assistance function like we had discussed before and find the correct amf to serve this user for this given network slice assuming here that the the amf is able to support the network slice assistance information uh the requested one the amf takes the request and then if this ue is coming in from an old amf it will reach out to that old amf to get the ue context the other old amf will come back and send the context so again this is the using the service nam communications which we saw and then the service operation within this service is the ue context transfer right so this is your service this is your service operation then optionally you can perform the authentication and security uh and this authentication and security uh is again optional because all we are really doing is we are switching from one amf which was the old one to the new one so it is optional to the network operator so the amf at that point the new amf acknowledges that it has received the context and then at that point there is the user connection management registration process that happens where the new amf registers with the udm and informs the udm that the new amf is now the new amf at that point uh the udm pushes out all the subscriber data to this new amf and the amf the new amf subscribes to the udm regarding all the changes that may happen for this subscriber related to the subscriber data management again we have seen these in the services section when we were looking at the services offered by the unified data management at that point uh the udm needs to send a de-registration notification to the old amf because the old amf is no longer serving the subscriber this guy acknowledges with a unsubscribe message and then the new amf fetches the policies uh from the pcf and creates the required associations using the am policy control service again and then the service operation is create and then it sends a request gets a response and then at that point the amf also selects the smf the session management function and uses the service pdu session and the the service operation update sm context or the release sm context and at that point the smf has been selected and if everything is successful at this point the amf sends a registration accept and the ue sends back a registration complete at that point the amf can create use the service operation create for the service ue policy control with the pcf here and the pcf this is again a request response so this is the registration process at a high level and we will look into a little more detail in the next couple of slides so here is the step one where the ue sends the registration request to the ran the new radio in case of 5g or the next generation rand however you want to call it uh the registration requests include some key details uh if temporary identities uh like the 5g timzy or the globally unique amf identifier are included and the rand can map these to a valid amf ran forwards the request to that amf else it sends to the default amf right amf selection can also be based on the network slice selection assistance information like we had discussed in the previous slide so just to add a little more detail again this is the 3gpp spec if you want to look at it in more detail but here are the mandatory attributes that are present in the registration request so there is obviously the registration type this will be dependent on either it's an initial registration if it's a periodic registration or a mobility the ones that we had seen in the previous slide or the emergency as an example and then it will send also the mobile identity which again can be a timzy or it can be a 5g guti so those are included here and then you obviously have as an example the the network slice requested network slice selection assistance information can also be sent here which is again an optional but if it is sent then the iran uh takes that into account for the amf selection if this attribute is not there then uh the amf selection is a purely uh determined by your uh 5g guti right so we you know the 5g guti is composed of your set of amf identifiers right i'm just going to put this amf id which is obviously composed of a region id set id and an amf pointer right if you recall from our section and then we have the timzy right so if the ue sends this guti as part of the registration request the iran can identify which amf this subscriber was previously connected to and it can send it it over there if if this ran has the connection if it does not then it just sends it to the default amf and then the default amf can fetch the context from the old amf so just to kind of make it a little more clear so we have the nr new radio and then say this is the amf right so if this amf id is for a amf that is already connected to the new radio then the registration request is sent to this amf if this amf id does not identify the amf that this guy is connected to so say we had a different amf like this guy and we did not have a connection here this connection was not there in that case uh the nr would send the request to the default amf that is configured on the new radio and then the new amf will reach out to the old amf so it's an indirect way and will fetch all the context for this given subscriber okay so let's move on then so in case a new amf is selected uh the ue registers in an area where it is not served by the old amf and the ue provided a globally unique amf identifier containing identity of the old amf the new amf retrieves the ue context from the old amf so yeah we saw that in the previous slide and as part of this request the uh the new amf will send the 5g guti uh it will send the reason why it wants to uh fetch the context and then it can also send the registration request that the ue sent to the network so it can send that to the old amf as well and then in the response so we have the um amf so here is our new amf and then here is our old amf as an example right and these uh we get the context request and then we get the context response right so this is the request and then this is the response so the request maps to uh this and then the response maps to this right and then the response will have your permanent identity you will have your generic identities uh you'll have your duty permanent equipment identifier a bunch of drx information uh then all the subscription related information so list of event subscriptions of by other uh control plane network functions that had subscribed to amf uh the old aomf they are also passed on to the new ams so that the new amf can notify any network functions that had subscribed for events such as ip address change mobility for this given user so let's uh move on then the authentication process is carried out as this as we described before right so again this is optional so it may or may not happen in case a new amf is selected it lets the old amf know that it is taking over so that is where this process happens where the once the context has been exchanged the new amf sends a notification to the old amf that hey you know i'm serving this new subscriber that's why you you can clear all your context for that subscriber so four is this guy and then in five the new amf registers as the serving amf for the ue in the specific access technology using the uh ue connection management service uh that we had looked at in the uh in the past there right so this is where this step happens uh it also gets the subscription data um from the udm and it subscribes to the uh updates if they are uh if any of the subscription data changes the udm is going to notify the am f about those changes okay and then the udm notifies the old amf that it is deregistered in the udm because the user has moved into a new amf so that is where the unsubscribe service is used so then some of the other remaining uh in case the access and mobility policies are deployed amf initiates establishment of the amf policy association with the pcf so this is in step six uh where this guy is able to uh get all the policies for this subscriber uh and then it it the amf is able to get those policies from the udm when it was getting all the subscription data and at the in this step it is creating an association uh with the pcf for this given subscriber again this is optional so if your pcf is deployed you will do this if not it won't and then if the ue had indicated that it wants active user plane connection for any existing pdu uh amf invokes the pdu session uh update function uh update sm context service operation for those sessions so typically uh when you are doing a registration message procedure to the network you can either be doing it due to mobile originated signaling or it can be mobile originated data right or it can be mobile terminated correct so if it is mobile originated data the ue identifies in the registration request all the pdu session ids for which it really wants to do data traffic so this is what is sent here in the pdu session id and then the and that is an indication for the amf to reach out to the smf in step 7 telling that the user is going to actively use the following pdu session ids and then the smf can interact with the upf the user plane function and can make sure that those pdu sessions are are active for the ue to use now there can also be a scenario where uh certain pdu sessions are not available uh in the new uh say the new smf if there is a new so in this case we are assuming uh the smf is constant but you can definitely have a scenario where uh your smf is also changing so this would be your new smf and then the new smf can probably not can probably not you know serve all the pdu session ids that this user has requested so in that case the amf actually reaches out to your old smf which will be this and it tells it to release all these session management contexts for the pdu session ids that can't be served okay so let's move on um and then if a registration is successful thus far then the amf sends a registration accept message to the ue and the ue can send a registration complete message in case ue policies are deployed the amf initiates establishment of ue policy association with the pcf this allows pcf to provide ue policies to the ue so if you remember in in 5g there is the possibility where a pcf can provision policies directly into the user equipment and this is where this service ua policy control is used and the pcf creates this association with the amf and then those policies can be pushed on by the nas protocol by the amf to the ue if you are interested in lot more details around the registration process i would recommend checking out this spec this has a lot more information yeah so that is it for the registration process hopefully it makes a little more sense the registration procedure is the first step that the ue does when it tries to access the network", "ClHenYFZy4Q": "I'm gonna taste it the Sweet Cheeks doesn't have one come on that's why you burped why

millions of dollars so be sure to watch all the way through so you don't miss any of the important details as we do have a lot to cover now before i hop into this video if you are new to this channel you're going to want to subscribe as i talk about the hottest stocks and always get straight to the point so please consider subscribing and turning on your post notifications if you like channels that get straight to the point with that said let's get right into this video so the first 5g stock on the list is ericsson ericsson generates revenue from two sources first it provides hardware software and services to telecom companies around the world these products are the connectivity solutions that telecoms require to deliver 5g service to their customers as the world continues to digitalize ericsson will benefit from this transformation secondly ericsson also generates a royalty of up to five dollars per smartphone from its 5g patent portfolio in the second quarter of last year the company reported a small one percent year-over-year increase in revenue given the global pandemic these results were better than expected on the bottom line ericsson boosted gross margins with 38.2 and operating margins by 8.2 during the quarter resulting in a doubling of free cash flow ericsson currently is providing 5g equipment to 56 live 5g networks in 29 countries including china the company's commercial deals for 5g equipment hit 100 in august with almost 60 of them already announced to the public then on september 10 eriksen announced that its 5g rollout with spain's telefonica had begun it expects to have thousands of ericsson sites activated by the end of 2020. those sites will provide telefonica with 75 coverage across spain including both barcelona and madrid while covet 19 will slow the rate at which ericsson can install the equipment for some of the 5g launches its sales development team can continue to broaden its customer base that makes ericsson an attractive buy among 5g stocks the second 5g stock is nokia whenever you mention eriksen its swedish rival nokia isn't too far behind nokia ericsson and samsung collectively control more than 50 percent of the network equipment market with that market share expected to grow to beyond 65 by the end of calendar 2025. but while nokia looks like one of the best 5g stocks based on positioning investors will have to monitor recent changes in leadership on august 1 nokia installed a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer joined the company one month later ubs analysts believe the new ceo and cfo will continue to carry out the company's three-prong strategy for growth this includes developing an end-to-end 5g solution for its 5g customers designing a strong software offering and creating a strong enterprise channel in the past two years nokia has done an excellent job developing software and enterprise businesses the analyst's most significant concern is whether nokia will be able to execute its plan our base case on the stock at this point remains that a lot of underlying challenges the business was facing in 2019 have already started to improve with better execution through the first half of 2020 and we would certainly look for this to continue through ubs analysts wrote in a note to clients on september 7th nokia learned that it lost out to samsung for a contract to supply some 5g equipment to verizon although the verizon contract was a big one at 6.64 billion dollars ubs believes nokia has enough on its plate to be successful over at least the next few quarters if not longer next one up is t-mobile the long-awaited 31 billion dollars merger between t-mobile and sprint was completed on april 1st last year bringing together the country's third and fourth largest wireless companies and their collective subscribers put t-mobile on much more even footing with verizon as part of receiving justice department approval for the merger t-mobile has promised to deliver a 5g network to 99 of american homes within six years it will also ensure 90 of the population receives 100 megabits per second analysts generally have t-mobile among their best 5g stocks to buy of the 26 pros covering t-mobile 19 believe it's a strong buy or buy six call it a hold and just one says to sell all told they have an average price target of 136.90 suggesting they believe the stock will improve by 22 over the next 12 months with a merger closed the company can now focus on integration which is expected to generate greater than six billion dollars in annual run rate synergies william blair analysts wrote in a note to clients the fourth stock is analog devices analog devices manufactures analog to digital converter chips which as the name implies convert analog electrical signals to digital signals because analog devices sells most of its products to other businesses many investors likely aren't familiar with the massachusetts-based company but it's still an important contributor to the 5g revolution the typical 5g base station requires eight times as many channels as a 4g base station to process the signal needed for wireless phone transmission this provides analog devices with a significant 5g opportunity analog devices participates right in the signal chain that gets multiplied by 8 greg henderson a senior vice president and analog devices recently told bank of america securities communications infrastructure was hugely positive in the quarter posting 15 year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2020 after being down 23 annually in the second quarter wright's argus researches whom recently affirmed its buy rating after analog devices fiscal third quarter earnings the company continues to see 5g as a multi-year tailwind in the third quarter wireless strength was aided by demand strength in wireline as carrier and data center operators work to keep up with surging traffic across core and edge networks in mid-july analog devices announced a 21 billion dollars all stock acquisition of maxim integrated products the combined business will have annual revenues of 8.2 billion dollars more than 2.7 billion dollars in free cash flow and an enterprise value of 68 billion analog devices has a history of successfully integrating acquisitions and adding tangible value for its shareholders so view this as a plus the last one is american tower american tower is a real estate investment trust that owns approximately 181 000 cell towers worldwide including 41 000 in the u.s wireless companies lease space on the company cell towers to attach their communications equipment with the ongoing move to 5g the company has experienced significant growth credit suisse provided a lay of the 5g land a few months ago and its optimism for american tower which it rates it outperform and this is everything to do with 5g it expects wireless carriers to invest 32 billion dollars in capital for the 5g rollout between 2019 and 2023 with the addition of a possible new fourth major wireless carrier in dish network the number of tenants looking for tower space will keep moving higher while attendant and verizon have said they plan to slow tower spending in the next few years t-mobile is expected to ramp it up ultimately u.s tower spending could be at the peak and due for a slowdown however emerging markets such as india africa and latin america will make up for any slowdown experienced in american towers u.s business by investing in american tower you're betting that 5g will be one of the top technology transformations of the next decade and it's a differentiated bet at that unlike the other 5g stocks on this list american tower is a real estate play one that has grown its dividends every quarter since 2011. so these are in my opinion the best 5g stocks to buy now thanks for watching and make sure to watch the next stock trading videos that will show up right about now [Music] [Music] you", "ZfCj6A8g5zU": "hello i'm joined here by oren balisti from silicon welcome aaron thank you very much thank you for talking to us today yes maybe we could just start off with uh just explaining who silicon are and where it fits into the decoupling of network services disaggregation massive market maybe just give us an overview of where you fit into that thank you so silicon is a company well over 30 years in the market silicon is a over 100 million dollar sales a year we are traded in a nasdaq under the name silk so we're a public company and silicon is focusing on cloud market telco market networking cyber security everything related to packet moving in the disaggregated market it's actually open for silicon a massive opportunity because operators now are open to buy white box solutions smart appliances adding card accelerators so the white box opportunity create for us a way to integrate our solution into more and more use cases and when silicon is looking at this market it creates for us a massive opportunity to get into new markets like for example png like a security market pattern matching a 4g 5g developing solutions for both the edge and the core accelerate all the solutions that create a better performance lower latencies and those together actually create one solution that create value for the operator yeah let's just pick up on 4g 5g as you mentioned mobile open ran massive amount of activity now or it's building up at least pushed by the likes of the oran alliance the telecom infra project maybe just tell us a little bit more about silicone and how it positions in 4g and particularly 5g as we as as we move forward when silicon looking at the mobile market first of all we are a member of tip or run were part of ocp for the hardware we're looking at those markets and we see that we can provide a very high-end appliances so when we're looking at those appliances there are mainly three type of appliances we're looking first of all at appliances that can provide the edge specifically view in the due we're developing the full appliance we have adding cards for different type of connectivity a 10 gig 25 gig we have a time synchronization solutions we have offload and maybe uh when when we're looking at this market we can create a different solution whether those are software a partial acceleration of a fully accelerated l1 and those create for the operator a range of choices whether those are software a hardware or a mix of both yes and as of course within this sort of run environment front hall connectivity is a very very important part maybe if you just expand a little bit further on silicon's approach to front hull so in the front hole specifically while developing a solution for time sync while developing a range of heading cards that include synchronized internet ptp 1588 those can be ranged from four port to eight port 12 ports and all those may include gnss receiver so we are actually creating the full synchronization platform for the access for the mobile access network the second type of solution is partial offload partial offload including a chip like a acc 100 from intel this is accelerating the ldpc for the error correction and this is working with collaboration with the intel flexure the third line of solution is fpga card in the fpga card we are creating accelerator for the l1 which is way beyond the for the whole correction and we can actually create more connectivity or we can connect more radio units to 1du and by that we can scale the network much faster so it's a different type of solution starting from software to partial offload to a fully accelerated l1 and do these capabilities they enable you presumably to get involved in other markets maybe you could just just explain a little bit about that okay when uh we're looking at other markets there is a very interesting market of private lte and private 5g the private ltn 5g they create a out of the box solution we can create an appliance with all the hardware accelerators we are collaborating with software companies and we create one solution so when you are coming to deploy a private lte or private 5g we can bring you one box solution that including all the access and network and we can connect directly to the radiohead we are also part of the ongo alliance and by that we are creating this the right specification for our platform in order to integrate seamlessly with the software vendors it's clear that you've made very good progress already but i'm going to put you on the spot a little bit and just tell me a little bit more about your future roadmap what's coming around the corner around the corner there are so many many surprises for 2021 and 2022. so first of all and the obvious one we are align with intel well developing the next generation appliance based on intel and next generation processors we will have appliances starting from four core up to 10 core for rural areas will have appliances for 10 core to 20 cores for open areas and will have high dense open appliance that will range from 20 cores up to 36 cores and this is something that will create for us opportunity to offer software vendor and the operators a full range of appliances on top of that we are developing appliances for uncontrolled environment and for temperature range minus 20 to 55 and by that they can get those applies to uncontrolled environment which is very typical in those c deployment models on top of that we are developing an outdoor view that can be poll mounted and this is very interesting because we will not require a specific room for this we can mount the view next to the ru on the pole and by that reduce the real estate required from the operator so again when we are looking at an operator we need to create for them a portfolio of product so they can actually use for many many deployment models without any software integration and without any software onboarding that require effort yeah it sounds like a very appealing story to operators so thank you very much aaron for your time it's been great speaking to you thank you very much thank you very much", "s9Nh8GGpIUo": "[Music] at blue Wireless we are the leading experts in carrier grade millimeter-wave a technology predicted to power the next generation of wireless connectivity the radio spectrum typically used for today's networks is becoming increasingly congested as more people and devices come online so we've shifted our focus we're using a whole new radio spectrum between 30 gigahertz and 300 gigahertz and shorter wavelengths or millimeter waves which provide faster connectivity within this spectrum our sweet spot is the unlicensed 60 gigahertz band we've solved all the technical challenges facing this new band so interference and drop connections can be a thing of the past the result is multi gigabit performance that suits a variety of applications in the consumer and telecoms markets applications like these demand robust performance at a cost that's accessible and predictable but operating in the unlicensed band means resolving complex wireless coexistence issues which makes it very technically challenging there are two links here a wanted link and an interfering link we set up three different scenarios to validate our interference mitigations performance and investigated three signal to interference ratios or si are zero dB where the signal is the same strength as the interferer 6 DB where the signal is 4 times its strength and 12 DB where the signal is 16 times its strength [Music] this proves that channels can coexist seamlessly up full band performance providing effortless consistent connection while protecting the links and it means we can reliably deliver fiber-like wireless capacity at a lower cost than currently possible within the licensed spectrum allowing our system solution to take on even the most complex of environments blu wireless powering connectivity", "V3W7yVat3wo": "hey everyone adam simmons here from dgtl infra short for digital infrastructure much has been said about how 5g will change our lives but a lot of the talk has been unclear or piecemeal at best in this video i'm going to give you the truth about 5g including how it is different from 4g why it matters to you and how it is tied to digital infrastructure you might actually be able to cut through all the hype and other garbage you hear in the news about 5g so stay tuned and i will break this all down for you before i do be sure to subscribe to the dgtl info channel and turn on the notifications so you don't miss my next in-depth video that is coming out soon now let's jump into the video so 5g stands for fifth generation wireless technology following 4g and 3g each generation of technology gets faster more reliable and every g has changed our lives in both small and big ways 3g brought internet and email to our phones and 4g allowed for things like rideshare apps and streaming video let's walk through some of the meaningful breakthroughs from 4g so we remember where it has taken us first is mobile gaming 4g allowed us to have internet connectivity on our mobile devices that facilitated games like candy crush clash of clans and pokemon go next is mapping we no longer use paper maps we use apple maps waze and google maps all on our phones and never have to think again about the direction of where we want to go to mobile payments was an incredible breakthrough because it allowed us to transfer money very easily to our friends and family think about paypal venmo and zell which allow for quick transfers of money whether it's for a meal or rent payment next is music streaming which brought us the likes of spotify apple music and amazon music no longer do we have to load mp3s onto our device we can just choose the songs we want to listen to on the go next is ride hailing services so if we think about platforms like uber lyft and grab they've all made it much easier to get where we want to go without having to own or be with your car at all times and finally is video calling or video conferencing and so we're using skype facetime and zoom video to communicate in a much richer form than we used to and that can all be done on a mobile basis so what is 5g and what does it offer beyond these 4g use cases 5g technology is a combination of software algorithms firmware and new hardware so therefore in order to run 5g you need to get a new device or a new piece of hardware like the iphone 12 or samsung galaxy s20 5g will be one of the critical enabling technologies that eventually brings us autonomous vehicles and autonomous drones however the benefits of 5g go much further deeper and more provocative which we'll discuss now so there are a tremendous amount of improvements from 4g technology to 5g technology and we'll walk through some of the key improvements now as it relates to your experience and also the enhancement of businesses going forward so first is lower latency 5g networks deliver 5 to 10 times lower latency 5g provides 5 milliseconds of over-the-air latency a meaningful decrease as compared to 4g networks which provide latency levels of 50 to 100 milliseconds this means instantaneous always-on and always-connected networks low latency means that the time frame between initiating a command and then it actually executing and being visible to a user can almost be real time so specifically it's the effective signaling time between the cloud response to a phone or a phone response to the cloud and the user getting the signal back in the other direction so if we start to think about some of the consumer focused applications that lower latency brings us first is cloud or mobile gaming so no longer do all of the components of a large application need to be loaded directly onto the device but rather much of it can be streamed wirelessly as the user is playing that game another consumer use case is streaming video on your phone instantaneously with no buffering latency reduction is especially important for new use cases like augmented reality and virtual reality where lag times in signals can provide a literally dizzying experience for people and a use case like gaming on a console like a playstation or xbox will become more sophisticated with this virtual reality so for example gaming will be better able to incorporate gesturing as opposed to relying solely on gaming controllers for user input when a user swipes their hand in the air they're going to want instantaneous movement on the screen in order to get that reaction latency needs to be improved and can be done so through 5g if we think about what latency brings to business applications common themes here are in smart manufacturing and robotics so it allows workloads from machinery sensors and devices to be placed onto the network since latency in 5g is less than 10 milliseconds applications can run on the device or they can run on the network because it's more cost efficient applications will gravitate to run on the network by removing applications from the device it allows devices to become cheaper because not as much computing power is needed on the device itself moving to the next key improvement area for 5g number two is increase speed so 5g speeds have the potential to reach 10 gigabits per second which compared to 4g could be a hundred times faster if we think about the 4g lte network speeds today these network speeds are currently 50 to 70 megabits per second in 5g there are really three different types of bands first is low band 5g an example of which is 600 megahertz spectrum from t-mobile this low-band spectrum offers only modest improvements of speed so think about 100 megabits per second and above but this 5g service is more for coverage purposes and that's why low band is used as a nationwide 5g service that is accessible to more than 200 million people in the united states currently the next type of 5g spectrum is called mid band and an example of this is two and a half gigahertz spectrum t-mobile is also deploying two and a half gigahertz mid-band spectrum and they are currently achieving peak speeds of between 600 to 700 megabits per second and average speeds of 300 to 400 megabits per second so a significant increase from 4g lte think about double those speeds and mid band is currently being rolled out in more of the dense urban environments like philadelphia new york city los angeles chicago and houston then we have high band 5g this comes in many different spectrum bands and is also known as millimeter wave spectrum but examples include 24 gigahertz 37 gigahertz or 39 gigahertz spectrum and speeds here are the highest so if you're able to use high band 5g you can currently access speeds of 1 gigabit per second and even 2 gigabits per second with the potential for future improvements up to that 10 gigabits per second level and if we think about in the us some of the carriers offering millimeter wave spectrum this is verizon's 5g ultra wide band offering and att's 5g plus offering so what does faster speeds bring us it's all about instant access to services and applications faster speeds will enable more video streaming including more high definition video streaming so think 4k and 8k streaming onto your mobile device and better live streaming of video on a mobile basis so no longer will live streaming from celebrities or social media influencers be in really choppy or grainy quality it will improve over time with 5g another application of having faster speeds is if you want to download an entire season of your favorite tv show so users will be able to download a season of game of thrones in about four seconds using the fastest speeds under 5g so moving to the third key area of improvement for 5g from 4g which is higher density or a greater number of connected devices on the network so 5g has the ability to support 10 times as many connected devices per square kilometer of network on a 4g network only a hundred thousand devices can simultaneously operate in one square kilometer in doing so 4g is able to allow smartphones smart watches and vehicles all in close proximity to be connected to the same tower cell site in comparison though on a 5g network one million devices can simultaneously operate in one square kilometer therefore 5g allows for what's known as the internet of things or millions of low-cost sensors distributed everywhere to be connected to the network but what does this mean and what does it change so in 4g there is a scarcity value associated with a connection to a tower cell site 4g technology facilitates 2 000 connections per tower cell site which causes each individual connection to be scarce in its value this scarcity in turn drove a need for the carriers like at t verizon and t-mobile to generate a minimum threshold of revenue for each user that is connected to their tower sell site so what 5g will do is 5g will offer a 10 000 times increase in the number of connections per tower cell site which means that the connection itself becomes less scarce this enables carriers to provide service for each connected device at a much lower price point because the scarcity of connections is eliminated it enables more sensors more devices and other internet of things devices to be connected to a tower cell site simultaneously because of this increase in density sensors can be cost effectively used in many different industries where they could not be cost effectively before these include utility management pipeline management and traffic management so moving to the fourth key area of improvement for 5g from 4g which is added capacity also known as network throughput so 5g will increase network throughput which is the amount of data that goes through a tower cell site by 100 times throughput increases drastically with 5g with a possibility of 10 terabits per second per square kilometer as compared to the 4g network currently which has throughput of one gigabit per second per square kilometer so throughput means how fast bits per hertz of spectrum can travel to the network and how much capacity can be taken over a certain point in time or certain spectrum band of network at each frequency this is important because as data usage is increasing by 30 percent or more each year all that extra demand requires more capacity particularly in high traffic areas like urban environments so if we think about what the applications for this added capacity brings us improved network throughput will make phones react faster with a higher quality signal which will enable users to accomplish more in each session on their phones particularly this is relevant for cloud-based applications with bits traveling from the cloud to a phone or from the phone back to the cloud the fifth key area of improvement for 5g from 4g is energy efficiency so most people believe that 5g requires more consumption of energy and resources but actually it requires less consumption of energy by optimizing the radio signals 5g allows for only 10 percent of the current energy consumption experienced in 4g networks meaning energy efficiency of 90 percent so this is obviously very important from an environmental standpoint and also for a consumer energy savings of ninety percent result in much longer battery life for your phones so those are the five main areas of improvement from 4g to 5g there are a few other areas i just wanted to highlight as well which also will improve so this includes spectral efficiency from a carrier perspective like at t verizon and t-mobile average data per user per month continues to increase and therefore becomes non-economical to continue using 4g 5g allows these carriers to place three times more bits per hertz of spectrum that they have available therefore 5g will make it three times more efficient for the carriers to utilize their spectrum assets and they do this through the way that they can allocate and reuse spectrum this allows the cost per gigabit for these carriers to come down when 5g is employed and for the carrier to continue allowing its users to consume more data with improved spectral efficiency it provides a cost benefit to the carrier to replace 4g algorithms with 5g algorithms in the network and that's exactly what they're doing another notable improvement of 5g is reliability and reliability of uptime in 5g is 99.99 percent of the time so three nines in 5g which is one more nine than what 4g offered so 4g has 99.99 uptime reliability which is still very good and you may be thinking why does this even matter well 5g becomes particularly important for mission critical functions more on the business side so the improved reliability of 5g translates into only 5 minutes and 15 seconds of possible downtime each year whereas reliability in 4g allows for 52 minutes and 35 seconds of possible downtime each year so reliability becomes particularly important for industrial applications such as an automated factory that cannot have meaningful delays in its production as a result of network downtime the next notable improvement to 5g is mobility and the signal strength in 5g facilitates greater mobility allowing data to be transmitted to a device that is traveling at 500 kilometers per hour on 4g data can be transmitted to a device that is traveling at a maximum speed of two to three hundred kilometers per hour and again you may be thinking where is this applicable and so 5g allows data transmission in use cases such as high-speed trains and the future autonomous drones that are traveling at speeds of up to 500 kilometers per hour so if you have ever been on a high-speed train and not being able to use your phone to connect to the internet or perhaps in 5g you'll be able to do that and finally another notable improvement of 5g is again on the business side and it's within security so 5g has end-to-end security architecture including stronger subscriber authentication user privacy and network security so those are all the improvements to 5g which we'll highlight for you in this video but how does 5g and all this translate to digital infrastructure which this channel is really all about so if we recall that the four sectors of digital infrastructure are towers data centers fiber and the combination of small cells and distributed antenna systems so towers serve as the edge of wireless networks they are the first point of connection for end user devices like your smartphone and they remain the most cost efficient manner in which to deploy wireless spectrum particularly 5g spectrum in a 5g environment the equipment deployed on towers think antennas and radios will evolve to make use of these latest spectrum bands carriers like at t verizon and t-mobile are already deploying mid and low band spectrum on tower sites in order to provide the coverage for 5g today next are data centers and based on all those use cases we just talked about 5g is expected to drive a sizable increase in the amount of data that is computed and stored which will ultimately require more data center capacity with the larger amounts of data created as a result of 5g data centers provide central locations for using technology such as artificial intelligence to harness that data to create new use cases next is fiber and fiber is really the glue that connects the entire digital infrastructure environment together fiber is optical equipment that is used to transform data into light and light travels along the fiber thread and is reconverted at the other end of the fiber strand as more data is produced with 5g more fiber is needed as every part of digital infrastructure uses these fiber railroads to move data around finally our small cells and distributed antenna systems 5g is bringing the need for a significant increase in network density particularly in dense urban environments and stadiums in turn this creates the need for more small cells to be deployed in order to meet that demand for example 5g high band or millimeter wave spectrum only travels a thousand feet this means that in order to cover a one mile radius five small cell nodes are needed towers cannot be built in all environments particularly dense urban settings because they're simply too large or not wanted by local residents therefore small cells are the answer the same thing occurs in densely packed stadiums malls and university campuses and those are where distributed antenna systems really come into focus so hopefully you found this video helpful if you did then please share it with somebody you think might also find it helpful consider

right today we're going to be doing the unboxing and first impressions of the samsung galaxy a515g stay tuned alright everyone hope you guys are having a great day today we have the galaxy a51 5g in the house today we're gonna go ahead and do the unboxing and first impressions on this device pretty much show you how i feel about this phone as far as my first impressions go but first let's go ahead and start off with some of the specifications as well as the price now as far as the price goes on this device this device is going to be 499 dollars this is going to be a factory unlocked device you can get this on amazon you can get this on best buy and many other websites first and foremost the display size is going to be 6.5 inches this was released in april so this is a bit late as far as the display type resolution ppi and ratio we have a super amoled screen it's going to be 1080p we're gonna have a 405 ppi so a pretty decent ppi a 20x9 aspect ratio and a 87.2 screen to body ratio we're also gonna have a front-facing camera that's 32 megapixels we're gonna have 128 gigabytes of internal storage and we can also expand that with a micro sd card as far as our rear facing camera goes we have a quad camera setup so we have a 48 megapixel main camera 12 megapixel ultrawide camera 5 megapixel depth sensing camera and a five megapixel macro camera we also have six gigabytes of ram an exynos 980 processor inside of here 4500 milliamp battery and this is going to have android 10.0 alright everyone so let's go ahead and unbox this we have the phone on the top right here we're gonna go ahead and put that to the side as you guys can see pretty much the same as the galaxy a71 we also have our 15 watt fast charger right here which is good to see next we have this little box right here we do have our sim ejector tool right there inside of here we also have some documents as you guys can see so we have our quick reference guide and we have our terms and conditions all right everyone so taking a look around the phone as you guys see we kind of have this black back that cuts off so we have like two different types of patterns on this device which i think is really cool but we have the samsung emblem at the bottom of the phone we also have our quad camera setup i was talking about right here the main camera is going to be 48 megapixels second is going to be 12 30 is going to be 5 megapixels and fourth is going to be 5 megapixels so we get an ultra wide depth sensing and a macro camera in here which is always great to see and i feel like this device looks insanely sophisticated definitely a little bit heavier since it does have that 5g technology in here so it definitely feels a little bit heavier than the galaxy a71 right side of the device we have the power button just above that we have the volume up and down rocker bomb the phone we have our speaker as well as our noise cancelling mic our usb type c port and also to the right of that we have our headphone jack left side of the device we have absolutely nothing top device we have a noise canceling mic as well as our sim tray alright everyone so finally in the phone we have our front facing camera right there which is going to be a hole punch camera and that's going to be a 32 megapixel camera we're going to take a look at in a little bit uh but this device looks really nice the screen looks super super bright the colors are going to be vivid and are going gonna have very nice saturation as you guys know on these samsung displays they always tend to look pretty decent um going through the os though everything seems to be pretty snappy um obviously we're gonna do the full review on this device later on first and foremost just want to go and check out the speakers and the resolution of the screen on youtube so let's go ahead and check this out real quick all right guys so it doesn't look like we have stereo speakers but we do have a very very loud bottom firing speaker we can also watch up to 1080p at 60 frames per second so that's always there uh but just go ahead and listen to the speaker i think it sounds really really good so if you want to purchase this phone buy it through that link and it goes directly back into the channel just know it's going to be at the bottom of the phone so you guys can cover it up pretty easily when playing video games on your device uh but this is a very very loud speaker on this device the screen also looks very very good the colors look awesome um so you guys aren't going to have an issue there now some other things that you guys get on here is uh qr code scanning linked to windows mobile hotspot blue light filters smart view nfc in this device so that's really cool obviously dark mode we have edge lighting bixby routines we also have dolby atmos one of my favorite um tools that you get on the drop down bar menu makes the things you're listening to sound really really good we also have focus mode screen recorder inside of here so if you guys would like to use a screen recorder um straight from the drop down bar menu that's that's cool we also have samsung kids and we have quick share as well so that's just some of the tools that we have inside of here now as far as the geek bench store goes we have a single core score of 489 and a multi-core score of 1816 which i think is pretty decent now going to the single core score we can find our device in between the xiaomi redmi note 8 pro and the oneplus 6 so i think that's a very fair place for that device to be especially for the price we also have a multi-core score of 1816 and we can put that in between the xiaomi pocophone f1 and oneplus 6. um so very very similar to what we see on the galaxy a51 the regular one on geekbench 5 but the last thing i want to do is take a look at the camera and go ahead and wrap this up alright everyone so getting into the camera we have our ultra wide mode right here as you guys can see so that's nice to see we also have our single take mode right here um so that basically gives you a bunch of different options uh videos collages and things like that from one single take which is pretty cool also for a video we have 4k recording at 30 frames per second which is nice to see we're gonna go on the settings take a look at this really quick so it goes up to uhd we can also do full hd and we can also do 720p so that's great to see uh front video as well i believe we do have 4k which is great to see and let's go ahead and take some photos and see how they look all right everyone so i took a photo of the yeti right here this is a microphone it looks really really good honestly the edge detection the clarity everything looks insanely clear on this device i would say it's about the same as the galaxy a51 colors on here saturation looks great um everything on this camera is very very solid uh samsung did a really really good job on this as you guys can see we have insane detail on this as well we actually took a front-facing photo right here as well and i'd say it looks pretty decent i do feel that samsung needs to work on the front-facing cameras to not make their phones look like you know you took a photo on beauty mode but other than that this is a very very clear photo the skin tones are decent as well this is pretty accurate and um yeah other than that the camera is pretty solid yeah guys if you are interested in buying this device i will leave a link in the comment section down below as well as the description um i really like this device so far i think it's a really really solid device that you know hosts 5g obviously you get that premium price tag at 500 dollars pretty much i believe 150 dollars more than the regular a51 um is it worth it to you to have 5g you're going to kind of have to answer that question for yourself but honestly for 499 this is a very very solid device definitely going to talk about it more in the full review but i think it's pretty solid so far for what we get yeah guys if you did enjoy this video please leave a like down below as well as subscribing if you're not a part of the tech and already also hit

"7IMa0FXEVEw": "[Music] hey youtube how you doing this is tech extremist welcome to in the tech news today i do have a couple of articles and they are all related to a t you guys know we have been bashing att lately a lot of the other youtubers for their strategy for seemingly their lack of focus right and here is an article from lightreading.com that gives you a different perspective on it maybe the financial uh situation that personally i don't really talk about too much all right so some analysts are on att's 5g prospects right now this is looking at it from strictly the financial perspective at t plans to spend up to 8 billion dollars upgrading his 5g network with critical midband spectrum but some financial analysts remain uh decidingly underwhelmed what is att's values proposition all right so that's one of the questions and others agree att appears to be seeding the final wireless and a network plan that doesn't even attempt to close the gap with t-mobile and verizon they must realize that ambitions of growing customers under these circumstances are widely optimistic they can't have chosen the strategy and must be a result of difficult choices amid scarce resources the company is making the right investments in hbo and fiverr however we wonder whether those resources might not be better spent on the mobility business alright so mobility is still the bread and butter it still accounts for over half of the business or at least half so you put that you know you put two and two together you think you'd want to focus more on what is your bread and butter right if i'm making more money off of this here and i've given this a good try and it's not really producing what this is producing i'm gonna keep be focusing on what my bread and butter is so that is something that is very surprising about a t uh you know so the the hint here or at least what they think is that the management is you know pretty much constrained they can't really do it but obviously you can still come back and say this is still out of touch it's out of focus uh you know they they they you know have planned them correctly they have planned poorly they're putting their eggs in the wrong basket or most of their eggs in the wrong basket and it's just really speaks to what we have been hitting uh you know on with uh with att they're just out of focus it doesn't seem like a company that really has any real direction where they want to go they're having a hard you know hard time steering the ship in that direction meanwhile everything that's important gets left behind all right so that is something that they're gonna have to figure out because uh even though uh they did spend a good amount uh considering how much more verizon spent and how much more spectrum t-mobile has it is going to be a difficult thing now i will say this all right and this is going to lead me right into the next article don't completely count them out because one major mistake that i think t-mobile made recently is an announcing in their financial analyst or investor meeting whatever they call it is you know pretty much telling the world we're gonna lower our capital expenditures after three years i think that's what it was they they are the only one out of the three that is planning on lowering their capex now one thing to consider and something that you guys don't hear much about from us youtubers or whatever tech people whatever is that t-mobile has the lowest margins in the entire industry all right so that might be something that's making t-mobile make those types of moves in an effort to up that right the margins 18 t's in the middle and then verizon has the highest amount or the biggest margins so that's part of the reason why verizon can just throw money at things 18 t and t mobile especially more t mobile don't really have that luxury all right now leading me into this article as i was saying fiercewireless.com att signs five-year deal with nokia for c-band gear so again they're not completely not doing anything they are doing a lot of things that are gonna help them out but they aren't doing as much as specifically verizon all right and you know t-mobile again we can argue back and forth on that one them lowering their capex is just not a good look in my view i think that they could have better uh you know or not better explained it but they could have spent more money in order to continue maintaining that 5g lead i'm telling you right now some of you guys make all the excuses for t-mobile about how the money is not important it is important it is the most important part of the equation how do you think verizon has been able to keep up with less spectrum right now before the c-band auction verizon had the least amount of spectrum for a while they had it for a few years that way and they still managed to win awards and keep up even if you make the argument that t-mobile and att are faster whatever or better overall they still kept up at the very minimum although that's not the case obviously i think they think that they dominated a lot a lot of areas considering but money talks bs walks that is just simply the truth if you don't believe that let me lower your budget at home and see what you can do see how much more you know how many hobbies you have to cut down on or what things you have to cut you know down on that you know do do that you do day to day if i lower the amount of money that you have yearly monthly whatever you're gonna not do as many things it stands to reason right so let's just put that put two and two together if you're a verizon and you're spending a lot more money than everybody else you're feeling pretty good about yourself and if you have the ability to do it att and t-mobile not so much especially t-mobile but att you know they've been doing a lot of low band upgrades you know n14 or excuse me band 14 so they've been putting that out there so they did expand their coverage significantly where there is an argument to be made that they have more coverage than verizon does now but you know this is going to be expensive they don't have the tower density that verizon and t-mobile have all right t-mobile because of sprint and verizon simply because they've built out over the years we're not hearing about any crazy small cell deployments so what they're going to basically do is go back and put it on every tower they have now kind of like they've been doing just deploying other spectrum on on specific towers it's working for now but eventually that's going to come back and bite them because you can't continue doing that forever obviously eventually the costs are going to become too much i mean physics dictates i have said that in the past that if you spend enough and build out enough density you can make up for almost almost almost any amount of spectrum not completely so do keep that in mind however uh obviously we're looking at the economics of this based on that article that we saw last and it does seem like a t has some constraints that's going to keep them from you know becoming or being the leader here so just with all this being said with all this talk of att t-mobile and verizon i do anticipate that you know verizon will lead t-mobile t-mobile will probably be second and a t will probably be last right because although they're spending a good amount of money you got to consider how big how big their network is so what are they going to do targeted areas some areas you know it's a five-year plan so how slow is it gonna be whereas you saw mr dune from verizon come out and say oh they can spend the 10 billion dollars as soon as they can spend it if they can spend it all this year then by all means for the network and then of course uh t-mobile does have that advantage we will point that out they do have that advantage where they have a lot of towers because of the sprints are they going to leverage those are they going to leverage those is that something that's going to help them that's a question but still you know lowering your capital expenditures it doesn't really look good in my opinion anyway um so we'll see what happens att is doing something 18t signs five-year five-year deal with nokia for c-band gear all right they didn't disclose the financial terms of it um you know they they got a decent amount of spectrum in c-band but it just doesn't feel like they are doing enough all right so we'll keep an eye on all of this for you uh keep reporting on it uh keep you know analyzing it to see uh where

hopefully like the next hour of a guess i just checked on ups site and they're like in the next neighborhood so like a kid on uh christmas morning i'm gonna wait by the door until this thing shows up do a quick unboxing video and uh geek out so stick around so i'm not the only one that's excited for the iphone to show up got my little girl goose here lucy the dog we call her goose because she's so gorgeous hey sweetie she's excited too we're gonna just wait by the door patiently right all right i'm really geeking out just looked on the ups map he's right around the corner just about to get my brand new iphone 12 pro in pacific blue super stoked super excited can't wait to unbox it merely moments away from my iphone 12 pro being delivered we here she is are super excited aren't we goosey aren't we little goose yeah we're excited she can't take her eyes off the door love the support good dog super excited in a few more minutes we'll do some unboxing we go look who's here super exciting bam what up iphone ups man hell yeah [Applause] i appreciate just gave it to you so that's good thank you have a good day thanks so much all right all right guys just got it ups is just pulling away from my house as you can see iphone 12 pro is in hand about to be unboxed here we go and real quick i picked up this cheap little case to see through case from amazon for like i don't know 10 12 bucks i got some glass screen protectors typically i like to get the privacy glass screen protector but this time i got just the regular ones i don't want to take away from that screen resolution so i'll be throwing these both on after we unbox this bad boy so without further ado let's get her out of the box alright guys here we are the iphone 12 pro unboxing [Music] beautiful all right this out of here so as you can see the box is much sleeker than last time very slim and that's because the only thing in this box is the phone itself and a charging cable no wall brick this time because they're helping the environment apparently we all know that's bs but doesn't really matter because i have everything i need not too worried about a wall brick pretty pumped to just open up this bad boy see how she looks here we go are you ready oh yeah drink it in drink it in all right that is awesome that color is pretty sweet i wasn't sure i was going to like it at first but after seeing it it's pretty cool pacific blue with the stainless steel sides very sweet some reflection going on so you can get a good look at that now this year they have what seems to be a cheap piece of white paper on the front telling you where your power button is where your volume rocker is and where your silent switch is all pretty custom if you've ever had an iphone it's all the same they've changed nothing so now time for the peel are you ready oh yeah oh yeah oh oh fantastic all right there she is everyone she is a beaut so i just want to do a quick unboxing i'm super pumped to get all my stuff thrown into this guy see how she works gonna boot it up here well the iphone's turning on inside the box like i mentioned you just have your charge cable you also have your sim ejector tool which is always good to have a billion of those your paperwork which we all take all the time to read and then a little sticker for apple i think they usually send multiple stickers this year you just get one throw this back in there otherwise that's all you get all right all right now my information is pulling over from my icloud backup i'm not going to spend too much time with this software as it's the same software as the previous device more so just the build first off i'll start by stating i did put a glass screen protector on here i went with this brand here got it on amazon it's a three pack for i think like 10 bucks very very inexpensive i'll link this in the description if you're curious about where to get that but as you can see it doesn't take much away from the clarity of the screen definitely recommends something on the front to protect to protect the device but otherwise in terms of the build quality of this phone i am very pleased with it already the sides are stainless steel and they're also squared off versus the old rounded edges on the 11 pro and 11 pro max i will tell you they look great although they are they do show a lot of fingerprints as you can see already along this guy so probably going to throw a case on this just because that's kind of an annoyance um just all those fingerprints you can see it makes it look kind of dirty but this little cutout what looks like a button is for five uh 5g millimeter wave that's an antenna so don't worry about what that does that's just for your uh your cell phone reception for 5g millimeter wave in terms of the phone itself it feels great it actually feels better in the hand having squared edges especially for one hand operation but overall the phone is just very clean and sweet so that's all for today guys just a quick unboxing video as always please like subscribe and share and until next time take care and peace out", "wsSPjn-j-cc": "[Music] hey guys come here from pocket-lint and this week oppo launched the Reno smartphone series in China the flagship of those four phones is the Reno 5g and we managed to get a quick sneak peek at the Swiss column 5g event in Zurich so this is the company's latest all screen phone from the front with its 6.6 inch AMOLED Full HD plus panel it's very reminiscent of the find X but the camera pop-up has changed significantly now instead of the entire top edge pushing up this shark fin pop-up moves up out of the frame pivoting on one end when fully out it's this wedge shape and as well as featuring the front camera it has the LED flash on the back now the other interesting feature is that triple camera system on the back it's completely flush with the multi-layered glass and features an ultra white a 48 megapixel primary wide camera as well as the periscope zoom camera now this zoom camera features multiple elements laid horizontally inside the phone and offers five times optical zoom but similar to the Huawei P 30 pro it also offers a 10 times hybrid zoom and this uses AI to keep those zoomed in photos looking really sharp or at least that's the claim now of course being a 5g event we had to check out the other headline feature to 5g now we ran a speed test on it while connected to a nearby 5g antenna and it resulted in download speeds of around 1.5 gigabits per second which is quite frankly insane now of course this was run in a place with no real competition for signal or traffic but it's still a really impressive figure other specs put this phone square in flagship territory - there's the Snapdragon 805 processor along with either 6 gigabytes or 8 gigabytes of RAM as well as either 128 or 256 gigabytes of storage add that to the hefty 4065 milliamp hour battery and you have a speedy fast phone that gets you through a full day it's also equipped with super vogue flash charging for stupid fast charging times we're happy to say that the color OS software based on Android pi seems to be improving as well it now has an app drawer yay and the revamp drop-down setting shade looks much better than the plain text based version used to apart from all that it's got your usual smattering of buttons and ports around the edges and it will be available in multiple attractive colors including this emerald green like color and we don't know how much it will cost in the UK yet or where you'll be able to buy it from but it is

if all of your data even if it's stored elsewhere will be with you all the time the second is massive machine interfaces and this is often known as Internet of Things or IOT and the idea here is to collect lots and lots of information from lots and lots of sensors to be able to make better decision-making in a centralized place like a data center this will help individuals with where to go or

said that right Peter but Peter has 15 more years 15 years in the wireless space sales background led him to being the CEO of future technologies he's personally personally and the company's best known for being agile problem solvers to fix existing networks to function efficiently to design and build new networks for public and private customers essentially what that means is they spent the last 10 years building private sized cellular networks so think LTE think AT&T Verizon but at a private corporate company level so really advanced the technologies that we're talking about here and we're gonna get into a 5g discussion here today and talk about is this 5g thing is it hype is it overhyped or is it a real reality that we're all gonna be living in very soon and what are the implications of that so peter caviola welcome to the show man let's start off with right away with what do you the most dialed in to man I I think for us it's all about connecting the dots so whether we're in the rail yard the oil and gas field a mine were out in the tactical environment with the military our job is to basically connect things that aren't connected a little crazy actually because it's non tangible but twenty years ago when the company was founded that was what we did and as the technology is involved our founder Nino canoe I don't know if he had a rock hit him in the head but calling the company future technologies twenty years ago made some because we just keep evolving but connecting the dots is definitely definitely what we're focused on nice nice so tell me a little bit about about how you guys got into this right I know we were talking a little bit before about my background in AT&T so like what was your background like what how did you end up here yeah so me me personally I got an entry level sales job out of college turned out we were combining a system that we had with with WiMAX at the time and pretty cutting-edge back in 2006 we were able to offer 20 mega bit of over-the-air internet and slowly WiMAX drifted to be towards the 4G standard and early on it was all international and it opened up at the US market 2007 see that was an eight with clear wire and then was sprint so for me it was a natural progression into the US market where before that I was in India I was in Latin America in Europe and traveling over there is a good experience but it wears on you so we ended up switching firms the future tech and future tech was founded in 1999 by our founder and was originally a satellite installation company oh no and then with nine yeah and then in 9/11 after 9/11 there was an opportunity to extend satellite connections for military applications and they extended into kind of private networks at that point for the military the rest is kind of history we went from satellites fixed broadband the 3G to 4G and now we're at this crossroad where 5 G's finally you know showing itself oh right right right oh yeah you're a quick shout out to Michael Evans out there from Florence South Carolina how's it go Michael dialed in if you guys are new to this show we're gonna have this talk it's gonna be an open forum open conversation so feel free to chime in the comments or at any point in time during the show you can dial into our conference bridge here 2 1 4 8 5 6 2 3 8 9 you can call in because I said immediately with us and I interject your stories comments or questions so I like that story I told you a little bit about mine like I kind of grew up in the wireless realm as well but more so like the wireless sales realm so I was kind of an early adopter to selling this stuff and like so on one of the first plaque berries dating myself a little bit but so in the very first iPhone and just kind of came up through the ranks of that and that's how I ended up at like corporate enterprise AT&T before I started on my own so always been fascinated with the wireless technologies just because you know I've been been in it been so close to it so you know people talk a lot about this 5g thing this 5g hype I think I personally get it I know you get it but I think a lot of people out there like some people think it's gonna solve like world hunger or and stuff like you know some people take it a little too far but you know what what's the realization versus the hype of you know what 5g is really going to accomplish for us I mean and nobody knows that full answer right I'm even even you because it's not here yet entirely right but just in your purview from what you expect to see yeah that's fair I mean as it relates today I mean we see especially in Asia early adoption where they put a lot of hardware out there and now their software updating to offer 5g in places like Korea and based upon the density of their network it's a much smaller parcel of land to cover than the US you know they're there early adopters and doing that in the US market you know it's it's been a process it took about 10 years for 4G to mature to where we see it today and you know we could walk down the road and watch video and that's uh you mentioned the first iPhone back then we were happy to have pictures sent you know now it's pretty stable but it took 10 years to get to that point and every day you know there's still a lot of capital being put into those networks by the by the big carriers but we're where it's currently you have Verizon with their ultra wideband which is in a higher frequency doing very high capacity and and that's great and and you can see especially around Superbowl time it's very clear that everybody's trying to demonstrate what what technology is available and the Super Bowl has become kind of a spotlight to that right right yeah with Verizon I'd Verizon's 5g broadcast cameras right oh yeah I mean they uh you know they're they're trying to create a you know alternative experience while you're at the game and with that spectrum they have they can do a lot it's it's basically it's the largest highway that's out there based upon the channel size and if you if you look at the Super Bowl ads there's a counterpoint you have t-mobile who very timely launched their six hundred megahertz which very low frequency band with less lanes in the highway more of a smaller channel size benefit is they have tremendous coverage and they've done that they plan their network well and they're taking advantage of that low frequency band so you know their big highlight at the Super Bowl was coverage not capacity right and their prep they're prepping us for I don't mean to catch other but they're prepping us for this 5g fall release so that what we think is coming it probably I think at this point we know it's coming right I phoned Apple kind of leads there's already 5g phones right but Apple kind of you know they have the market dominance at least here in the US so this year they're expected to launch 5g phone so of course we've got a high pass up for this right yeah 100% and you know not to get overly technical but you know what we're seeing adopted is kind of a non standalone network with our so I makan the core side basically the brain of the 5g network what we're seeing currently as the phones are coming out where they're still going to utilize 4G as its primary communication point especially for voice I mean if you think about a voice as a critical application if you have an 911 emergency voice is very important so how things are set up is that the new phones will still attached to the 4G network for voice carry that that traffic because the network's there and it's stable but then where you have 5g coverage you're going to be able to connect and do augmented reality 4k video as if for a consumer that's really interesting stuff you know so I think we've seen the capital by the primary carriers be put in place to have the hardware there and now it's a matter of moving and turning on the software and having it plan so that as they turn on more and more 5g its planned out and fought through because they got to make sure that the consumer traffic especially 911 one Falls or handled the right way right um if there's first first responders using that network like AT&T has been investing heavily in firstnet which is a National Public Safety Network and you know that's that's a huge investment that money you know tens of billions of dollars and you know they're being very careful around their 5g you know they want to be active in 5g but you know because they're carrying all those first responders traffic I think they're being careful around not over rotating and launching 5g too early so a lot of hype in reality some of the things that people talk about with 5g in the future autonomous vehicles ultra-low latency for automation of different networks the security benefits because there's end-to-end encryption yeah we're we're really not there I mean we'll see that maturity over the next five years and that's that's kind of where things sit right now there's a couple of things with the FCC that's going on as far as uh you know again spectrum is basically how many lanes are in the highway and if if you you know read up a bit there the carriers have an opinion that there's on the spectrum available in the lobe and that the mid band and the FCC is trying to address that and they're going to be doing some more spectrum releases in the mid band to make 5g more competitive because in other areas of the world like Asia they have a lot of low band and mid band that will go farther and in the US market that's been locked up and I do think the FCC is addressing that but it takes time right right on yeah I did it gets pretty political pretty fast on that side of things so um quick shout-out to Chris walls the free kid thanks cheatin and then Chris is the one who actually kind of set up this meeting so appreciate that I understand he works for you Peter yeah for over five years former military servicemen good man he's out right now with our customer unity fiber helpin us if they're doing a lot of fiber upgrades in the southeast region and Chris is helping them with that project force we appreciate that nice nice excellent and then a shout out to Tim hammer as well a local here with me in Dallas area he has a question and well he said 5g is obviously a game changer but when should we expect the tech to be leveraged commercially versus residentially first versus a residential customer rollout and then from what are you seeing the big guys are largely focused on reaching the people versus reaching the business so what's your two cents on that so I think I think that's that's very accurate I think the the current benefit of businesses would be where Verizon's got their ultra wideband 5g they're using that for fixed wireless access yeah so you're talking like what you're talking like rural areas potentially right so using fixed wireless as opposed to like bringing fiber in which it's not very economical economical right yeah I mean oh that's right I mean even in urban centers though the nature of the spectrum that Verizon has were seeing them to be able to leverage their 5g infrastructure for fixed wireless in a in an urban environment to be very competitive on price where maybe fiber can't get there in a timely manner or can't hit the price point because there's a lot of conduit work that has to be done driving the price up and I you know we're seeing that happen especially you know if you look at small to medium businesses that don't require gigabits of capacity if it's just a matter of like replacing t ones and having a low late sea connection that that that's a current business opportunity but you know there's a sexiness of 5g is really around the industry for dot o space and automation and there's just there's just not enough Network out there to actually cover those assets and collect sensor data and things like that in it you know I mean we're talking a couple hundred thousand sites that are in the macro network nationally and it takes a while to upgrade those and we're not going to see that type of use case for a couple years I mean it just it takes time to get it built oh yeah it definitely does Charlotte Susi an out there little back and forth with Tim that's awesome Tim how to follow up or is there even a difference to who gets access to what win I think you kind of answered that but is there a difference to who gets access to what and win what do you think yeah you know I you know on you know when we when we looked at this session it was kind of twofold so 5g is something that we all want to see kind of come come forward and have the benefit one of the big things we're seeing in the enterprise space is private LTE and a driver for that is recently we talked about the FCC being involved they opened up the CB RS frequency band and there's 150 megahertz of spectrum which is quite a bit it's in the mid band and it's available to businesses and you know non carrier folks as well as carrier folks so absolutely what we said acid CB RS what was that allocated for before it's just so like we know where it came from ya know it's that the government had the spectrum allocated for other use cases like satellite and other government so they had to over the last ten years they had to clean up that spectrum Reeb and things and then allocated there there was 50 megahertz of spectrum that was opened up back in I want to say 2000 eight which was in that like adjacent to that but it had limitations on how much power you could use and also the technology ten years ago isn't is not as good as you know LTE as it stands today yeah that goes back to my early days when we're doing WiMAX that was the 20 megabits service that was available now I mean we can go and do you know 100 plus megabit on a sector that's 5x and it the real interesting thing is like you could use it for an Internet service provider for consumer but we're seeing a lot of manufacturing facilities looking to leverage LTE in place of their Wi-Fi systems we're looking at if you picture a million square oh yeah how does it how does that work so so first of all we're talking about a lot of complex things we're talking about building your own private cellular network for a company right and you're saying yeah they might use that instead of a traditional Wi-Fi yeah yeah there's there's a lot of so you know where things are shifting so if we picture picture a very simple setting we have a million square foot wide open building that's doing logistics let's say so typically they're 30 foot in height and there's corridors and it's a matter of utilizing every square inch horizontally and vertically so it lends itself to real-time automation and autonomous so if you look at what Amazon's doing the Amazon has a lot of robots they have a lot of automation that goes into those warehouse environments and using Wi-Fi as the standard it's an option and it's there it's viable sometimes our company uses Wi-Fi but there's benefits to LTE we're one example the security side you're using a SIM card which basically is an encrypted way of connecting to the network just to simplify things but like the robots that are running around in these warehouses are going to be operating more securely because they're using a similar occasion versus a traditional IT Wi-Fi authentication that security is a big issue or reason and then the other the other driver is latency so if you're if you have a computer that's controlling these robots in that environment and it takes I'm going to exaggerate it takes one second to go to the robots and then back to the computer that's controlling it and then you could do it in let's say 10 milliseconds which would be one tenth of time it's a it's a one hundredth of the time it's it's a huge difference in how fast they can react and respond and and also work in the same environment because now it's not we're not just worried about robots and people like pedestrians in the area you have robots actually working together in these environments and that that ability to do everything as close to the real time as possible connecting back to the computer is a huge safety item and also from a inefficiency perspective every millisecond matters in that environment and and it's driving those IT decisions to be moving towards LTE instead of Wi-Fi in some cases not all cases but but in some cases where you need that ultra-low latency and security you know I'm pointing to Amazon just as like kind of the 800-pound gorilla in that space but we're seeing that there's a company that came out called that abadox and they basically have a logistics solution that uses robots it's modular and and and they did a demonstration with Microsoft at the Microsoft ignite event where they're they're deploying private LTE in a Microsoft environment on Azure stack edge it's actually taking the cloud distributing it to that location they're putting a LTE core in that environment and then right next to it they have the I'm going to say computer again but location that's running the robots but by everything being there the robots can run more and more efficiently which is you know at the end of day is about money oh yeah absolutely I mean in the logistics business like in Amazon's business like everything you want prime now like you HOT this thing in like two hours in order to get it to you in two hours like we have to cut every millisecond we have to scrape every millisecond we can in order to get it to your door but in two hours right and even that's not fast enough for some of us right so that's what's driving this right 100% so we're talking about in this environment maybe I don't know a bottle of a bottle of shampoo moving around a logistics facility so take that and now instead of it being in a very simple environment we go to a goldmine that instead of it being a million square foot box we now have a multi mile hole in the ground where they're where they're mining gold and now we're trying to go further in distance because it's a large you know it could be a mile in diameter and instead of moving a bottle of shampoo now we're moving they have what's called a hole or it's basically a large truck the size of a house is moving ironwork what Kyle let me ask you a question so what do you think in value each Paul so a dump truck think of a big dump truck besides your house yes yep how much gold do you think is in each load in one of those scenarios and one of those haulers but like you're not saying a dump truck that's hauling like pure gold or they're holding that gold like inside of rocks and so I iron where the iron ore that so basically they're moot they're taking or that's been mined oh they're transferring it from this the open pit to the factory where they'll basically put it into the factory and then produce basically gold brick but that that raw or one big truckload what do you think that run jeez you test my math skills here let's see one thing juggling what I think what I think it's worth and like monetary value or how much I gold I think there's yeah percentage of monetary value oh jeez what's Alexa what's the price of gold right now okay 1500 is 1004 or whatever right so I would say a truckload let's go with 110 million I don't know that's probably way oh that's far away 200 that it's about $200,000 depending upon the truck side okay okay so that was a way over I just failed the price is wrong the price is wrong there we go the brightness right that's right Alexa's wrong in a warehouse environment we're moving a two dollar piece of shampoo we want to do really efficient in these mine environments the haulers can only move 20 miles per hour so being efficient and running they run 12 hour shifts being efficient in doing these you know basically go to the the mining location fill up drive safely 20 miles an hour go to the factory drop it off and then go back what using Wi-Fi is not really possible to connect to it and go fully autonomous because Wi-Fi would require a lot of towers let's say to cover that area as you leave one Wi-Fi zone then you'd have to auto join another and then you know Auto joining and all that stuff reduces complexity that you know you might hand the handoff physical I said that's right because Wi-Fi really wasn't built to be doing vehicle handoff is built for for more of a campus environment so so the opportunity there is we can reduce the number of towers which is good reduces cost we could make it the latency lower and by doing that you could actually run oh and we've done this we you can run autonomous trucks and now instead of well one misconception when people when we talk about autonomous use cases people think we're putting folks out of business like you know Johnny the driver doesn't have a job what actually happens is Johnny now instead of driving a truck in a hazardous environment Johnny's now in a controlled setting driving that vehicle so it's not necessarily that it's going to be fully autonomous it just means that Johnny doesn't have to be in the vehicle you know and these are these are hazardous environments but but now the vehicle can run basically efficiently for a 12-hour shift and then go into maintenance it makes a huge difference in the yield so if we can get let's say we get in a 12-hour shift you get one more load it's 200 grand if you get 10 more loads it's 2 million dollars yeah it's pretty significant and and and the private private LLC right now provides that what will happen in the future is these private LTE networks will migrate to be 5g and in areas where like Rio Tinto has a mind just outside of Salt Lake City it happens to be right next to it's the largest copper mine in the world it's actually you can see it from space it's the largest open pit mine in the whole world where's that look at near Salt Lake City it's just outside it's just outside Salt Lake City at the Kennecott Copper Mine so you can look you can compromise me like if you go to Google Maps right now and you can go try to find it you can kind of see like copper color oh you can see the mine site okay I don't know that it's actually visible if you're if you're in if you're in space in the space station it's actually it's a recognizable object from space interesting okay it's that big all right yeah but but but in the future because that's so close to Salt Lake City you could see 5g built out and then 5g provided by a carrier actually service that mine because it's not in a remote setting it's right next to the city so there'll be this this bleeding point where between now and then you know the mines have to go out they have to provide conic maybe Wi-Fi doesn't make sense maybe private LT makes sense on the CBR s band there's also another derivative where some of like AT&T Verizon Sprint t-mobile they're recognizing that may be private LT has to be provided as a managed service yeah so there is there is a theoretical limit of how many people can have a private LTE right no no not really I mean because you've said that they don't they wouldn't they wouldn't then own the spectrum so would they be like in this private pool of like like kind of like the cloud is like a multi-tenant so like they're using the same spectrum that other private networks are using but somehow somehow there's no crosstalk like if you go to like a really good Wi-Fi area there's no crosstalk meaning like my iPhone can't see yours like that's real that's a secure Wi-Fi zone as best as you can right so it'd be kind of like that right so you'd be in the same span but we're walled off yeah no that's an excellent point so the CB RF band which is really what's driving that the private health need boom in the US market well what is the DVR I'm sorry to cut you off again what does the CBR S stand for broadband and I'm gonna IIIi I don't recall the acronym we have so many actors though so the Android and the name of it doesn't even matter then like we love acronyms sounds like a CB RS that doesn't really meet have much meaning it's just that's just where the band came from right yeah it's the name that the FCC gave this hundred megahertz of spectrum they got on and but but but what would happen in that environment let's say let's say we're in uh they were in Frisco right and we have a whisk that wants to use that spectrum we have the municipality that wants to use that spectrum we have a utility company that you want to use the spectrum what the government did is they said ok we're going to make this spectrum available you have to register to use it and they identified third parties that would be the intermediary to manage that so Google is one of them Federer is one of them calm scope is one of them and what they are is basically an intermediary exchange so they their sensors that are out there that look at different things and then what happens is if you have a network built in that setting you would register you'd plug in and your your network would actually connect to these intermediaries to kind of and make sure that to the best possible make sure that everybody using the spectrum efficiently and coordinating with each other and it's all done through you know software to coordinate all that real-time and that's that's what's going to be there that's that's a big difference between Wi-Fi where anybody can go and deploy Wi-Fi there's no you know exchange that's making sure that that's managed well and efficient and that's that that's a big advantage because it reduces the amount of like noise that's out there and improves the performance of the network oh yeah that's kind of tying in to a quick shout out to Pat Benoit thanks for tuning in he corrected US citizens band radio system so I pretty much got it um Merry Christmas Chris Wallace said a question for you well he said gold mines definitely need private LTE network but what kind of security encryptions are available for a secure network so he's just he's tossing you tossing you a slam-dunk here huh no I mean I would say that the biggest advantage from a security perspective is the is the encrypted them side of things so you know and we do this for the waiting so create encrypted SIM card right so what I'm up the SIM card is encrypted so Oh what does that mean that means that I can't go like duplicate this and I can't go into an AT&T store that get a sim and be on your network that that that's right so so let's say in the case when one of the one of the mind customers that we have they wanted to have a completely private network and they wanted to have their own SIM card so there's registration that you have to have to have a different parameters registered with let's say the authorities and then there's companies that make the the actual plastic SEM that has all of those properties in there and then it's it's secured through encryption where when you go into that environment your device would see the the wireless network and all it does is request access to the network it goes back to the computer that's running the private LTE and then the computer will say ok I recognize this SIM card and authenticated there and send back a signal only at that point when when the the SIM cards activated they'll actually be data traffic going back and forth which makes it much much more secure and again I think it's encrypted in that data packet now when we go to 5g we're going to have end-to-end encryption on that pathway which will increase that even further because 4G was meant for more consumers where when they develop 5g it's going to be even more end-to-end encrypted and that's going to be one of the other benefits that we see when 5g comes out I appreciate Chris lobbing that one out there yeah so so what else what else so you've been doing this you've been doing this with future technology so this is this is your company sounds like you had some partners involved right but even doing this with with future technologists had last 10 years is that right yeah so we we uh we were always in the private network side but we got in the private cellular network side because of the government so we had some very specific requests from the government where they have large training centers where they have to have communications and sometimes there's no other options so they have to build their own communications network so you know 10 years ago we were successful of winning some contracts where we built this will date it 2g 3G networks that we then modernized the 4G but because we're doing that for the government it was really unique because there there was no scaling down of cellular networks it was very expensive to do those types of projects but we built up the competency where we knew how to design them provide the equipment and then we have one network that we've been maintaining for eight years for the client and you know through that obviously we have to be very secure with how we handle a government Network you know we we really feel that we have a running head start for the market because this the CBR s band just opened up commercially last month and there's people that are trying to get into private LTE but they're starting day one where we basically have a ten year running head start yeah so you that's just another iteration for you go for you guys and real quick if you guys are just tuning in we're talking about 5g as you can see as you can tell if you have any questions comments stories or anything to share you just want to be connected to Peter kept yell here dial into the bridge right now two one four eight five six two three eight nine that'll make you a live caller on the show right this second and we can have a serendipitous conversation about this so Peter can you can you kind of elaborate more into that was a great example but can you take us deeper into maybe another example I know this stuff is kind of hard to talk about especially on a live format cuz you gotta be careful what you say here is there is there anything that you can share that like like wow like we would just be like wow that's awesome we want to hear that story yeah I mean you know cool things that we've done I want to be that we're on a live line I wanna think about how to freeze things should change names it's a John Doe and ABC company [Laughter] yeah we talked about the point networks in a warehouse he talked about the point networks at a mind site and and the first example I gave was it was an open pit mine where basically we're on the ground surface and there's a big hole in the earth we've also deployed some networks where were a mile and a half under the surface and tunnel underground I only have underground cellular network that's that's pretty fascinating right that's pretty fascinating yeah yeah you know it's a project in Canada and they were trying to get better health and safety analytics underground where they they wanted to they have walkie-talkies for boys but what they wanted to do is make a data network that could get them sensor data so they can know where their people are for location-based services they want to know where their equipment is and just collect data and what one of the things that we saw was that for every five Wi-Fi access points we could deploy an LTE network that with one there was a five to one difference and when you're building and maintaining infrastructure a mile and a half underground it makes a big difference when you could deploy one instead of file oh yeah I like the data so so but there's challenges right there's no GPS underground so you know how do you how do you do that it's great that we could go and transmit stuff but then it's like okay we want to transmit we want to know where things are and there's no GPS yeah things we have to figure out right like you guys need some like RFID type thing I don't even know how you would do it's just like tagged a location where you are underground right these are these are secrets that we figured out but we'll leave it yeah that's it so that's that's a cool thing you know we also have tactical systems where you know we work with with the military where we can do suitcase packages where basically a military battalion could go out open up a case and within 30 minutes have a fully broadcasting private LTE network and this is at like an infantry level where they can now use LTE in place of an old two-way system that was only voice now they can do video they can collect data they can obviously do boys is that using satellite I assume yeah well sometimes we'll send the the system out and I'll have no internet connectivity so it's just a local system that you know picture is setting up a base camp and then we want to connect the people in the area for a mission we can do that and then other times it is satellite relayed where if that's what the that's what the mission requires we can we can connect back over a satellite and connect out for the world sometimes we don't want to do that yeah yeah well yeah that's sometimes everything just wants to be left local but you know we're seeing things networks in flight is an area where we're getting a lot of requests we had responded to an RFQ for a geologist who is looking to collect sensor data in Southeast Asia we haven't deployed that Network yet but we're starting to see use cases like that where they're dropping ground sensors in in the ground to evaluate the soil and they don't want to set up a fix Network so they want to put a network in a drone and fly over and collect basically statistics off of the soil to evaluate whether there's diamonds there so we're you know it brings us into being that so for us it's we provide the brain that runs the network we provide the radio equipment but we're kind of very flexible around where are we putting the equipment we're putting it in the aircraft we're putting it out of mine or we putting it in a warehouse and then ultimately go back to the beginning we're just trying to design something to connect that end device we don't really care what it is and then carry the traffic there yes yeah pretty cool that's pretty cool so what I heard is that I could buy a briefcase LTE network from you and I could just like go into any random area and start live streaming like this essentially we bother on Kyle on tile 5g right Network yeah we can make that happen if I can pay for it I can afford it if you if you come to our office in Atlanta we have 50,000 feet down in Atlanta and we actually have a private LT demo room where we have a lot of this stuff like kind of on display different form factors different vendors getting uh getting pretty cool that's awesome that's really cool that's really cool man yeah maybe maybe well maybe well maybe we'll do a session there we could bring some of this to life maybe some drones and things like that yeah yeah so uh yeah that would be really cool I got my drone over here somewhere but so question for you this kind of bleeds into my world with your world which is pretty much the same world essentially but I'm looking at this SD wine box over here that has dual LTE SIM card slots on it so how much how much does your world bleed into a SD win that is like Software Defined Networking in the sense that you know we're we're bringing in like we're meshing that works together to create you know basically you know IPSec tunnels across the internet through multiple mesh networks right so how much of that it kind of bleeds into your world yeah you know that's interesting coin so we have a device segment of our of our business last year we sold about five million cell modems and and most of those modems go into some type of critical infrastructure utility or or whatnot so we're we're seeing we're seeing on a public network so we're putting a modem out or connecting up let's say a utility substation and that substation may have a fiber circuit to it as the primary and then it's using the cellular network as the backup and they they're setting up their network by using SDRAM for that we're seeing a lot of that denied that primary and backup scenario arm I think with private LC we'll see that to where if the client or 5g I think currently where we have fiber that will be primary and then whether it's a modem on a public network or private network that would be the backup what's going to be interesting is if you're drinking the kool-aid of 5g they're pushing that at some point in time 5g could be so stable that that could be the primary and the other means could be back up testings why yes I see it too I you know if you know the kool-aid really got to be mixed up at that point oh yeah you tell me that we would we would in favor of the this this fiber that we can see we would in favor of that we would you know I'm gonna trust a wireless more that I that I can't actually see you know that's as loud I mean I'm bold are our primary business is Wireless and I I would say and we're we're bold but we're not that bold we're like no use the for your primary and we're gonna give you this great Wireless 4G 5g for your backup but you know that fibers they're tangible what we're doing is oh you know yeah black art right here with the flood put put put put my house on the fiber please yes exactly exactly nice yeah nice well um but what what else so what is something if we flip the roles here for a second you're in my shoes right now what would you ask me that I haven't already asked you ah caught this all sounds great what does it cost all right let's hear it well I think it's uh I'm trying to answer your first question without realizing it today yeah circle back but that question is a part I mean you know I think there's a few things here there's a public network that's available today 4G a little bit of 5g it's priced pretty effectively right on a monthly you know you can get a nice circuit for forty dollars a month as a consumer as a business consumer you're getting a good rate for your cost per megabit so that's that's very viable in your IP environment Wi-Fi is very you know affordable it's there but it's it's in the you know all of the the chips so it's very easy to it basically an aid to your current situation and then the price per square foot is very let's say $2 on the comparison point if you're going to build private LLC it's probably more like a dollar fifty to two dollars so it's not something that's the most cost effective from just a cost per square foot perspective so you really have to look at okay do I want to have no infrastructure just connect some remote settings use a public network right because you wipe if it's we see this with utilities they have all these remote settings they know they can't build towers and connect every dot so they use the public network they have certain areas where Wi-Fi makes sense because it's dense and they have you know devices that are maybe Wi-Fi only that makes them and then there's you know mission-critical applications that they're going to spend a $2 because they want to have your grid be protected against cyber security so it is there is a cost component it's not flat across all these decisions and a lot of times it you know you mentioned uh you know advising clients on which cloud to use I mean you know you can use Azure you can use AWS and there's you know maybe some of the features match up but then there's going to be you know folks that are really in the know on cloud like yourself you're going to be able to speak to the nuances though it's worth spending a little bit more money on this because what you're doing really requires this additional level of security and it's more encryption whatever it is and it's really education and and sometimes we have clients that want the best because they could afford it and we have to kind of rationalize it you know we're happy to do that we're in the business to sell infrastructure but you really don't need that and we we try to be look at it as a long-term partnership but we're not trying to sell the most expensive solution we're trying to sell what makes sense like we as much as today we talk about 4G and 5g we do a lot of unlicensed networks and we do a lot of why by networks it really just it's a matter of finding the right balance of technical requirements and budget but it's a brought up the hairy hairy elephant did you did you I mean shattered my dreams man Kyle 5g is not gonna happen anytime soon so Wow but you know it's you know that you know the people with good pricing maybe we could help you that's true that's true ayat you know that is true that is true well I definitely appreciate it looks like we had no takers on the dial and today that's okay I see you guys watching thanks for tuning in we'll get you guys next time we'll find a more compelling reason for you to call in but that brings up this next segment here we're gonna jump right into speed dial are you ready ready for this Peter yeah all right cool one word it's a summarized twenty twenty-one word to summarize 20 20 ah for you I know you want me to say 5g but I'm gonna I'm gonna say private LTE okay all right the fair enough what was it was the first mobile phone you ever used this is very relevant for this conversation how it was a Motorola start touch again start touch nice nice what what is the best business book of all time again your opinion yeah you know I I like Jim Collins and I've read several of his books good degrade is the is up there great by choice I also like because I think you can make decisions to push yourself to be successful but both of those are winners okay cool which one edge up edges out the other ones remember I said pick one good good degree good good okay all right I like that all right cool digital resource app or website that you just simply could not function without go go deep here we we have developed we use a quick base as the software stack that we use to run our business and between our CRM and our project management function if that went off I'd have a big problem dad what about one that the rest of us could use what was an apple resource that is publicly available even if you got to pay for like that you just can't live without uh you know we use the hell out of Google Earth because a lot of times we're trying to someone says here's a GPS location I need to connect it and we're like well what are you trying to connect and the only way to go out you know short of actually going to the site Google Earth is the next best thing nice and ziane cane just called you out Peter she said basically said that private LTE is not one word but forgive that to you it's all good it's so good what would you tell go back in time you go back and tell your 18 year old self something what would that be well first thing would be graduate high school you know focus on that but past that you know I I think that working hard is the most important thing and having one loyal people so uh you know everyday wake up work hard nothing's given to you like you know my first job at a college I was making $25,000 that was my first job and I barely graduated high school actually because I enjoyed a lot of social life at that time but you know what changed is when I got to college you know work hard get the grades when I got out I got an entry-level job I never did any internships and my my undergrad and then ultimately I just worked harder than the people I competed against and the second part is I've been able to build a team of loyal people including the founder of the company that let me be me our chief revenue officer who was my mentor growing growing in the industry and then we built a great team so working hard and having great loyal people I love that and I wish we have more on that story because basically the what I heard is barely graduating high school - CEO of future technologies that's that's incredible man like that's that's a great story yeah so on that theme name-drop at least one person I have three here but they know at least one person that had the biggest impact on your life thus far I mean probably it be the same name I'm Peter the third but my father definitely helped kick me me kick me in the rear end when I needed it in gave me guidance was patient with me through not focusing on school and uh kind of pushed me push me through college and then you know in my current life he happens to be a lawyer as I went from sales to CEO deal with a lot of contracts and everything and he's always been very helpful with me you know throughout throughout the course of time and in the industry I would say it's two of my partner's so Dave l'amore was I was a 23 year old guy that came to him and said I have a three million dollar order I want to place with you and I couldn't spell ymax but I literally had a three million dollar order for him and he basically kept me inside the guardrails the first five years of my career and he introduced me to future tech and Nino could do our founder he accepted me I think the analogy that him and Dave used was I was a Ferrari the prairies are great when they're out on the highway and they're driving fast but they need a lot of tinkering and sometimes that's expensive but you know it's those two guys have definitely been the most you know impactful for me from a career perspective and they're and they're great partners excellent man excellent chance post shadow it's you out there he said plastics I'm missing the context here man I don't I don't know why I said that but let me know I guess hard plastics I don't know I don't know let me know later best compliment that you have ever received in your career peer no III think I'm bringing the zingers I'm bringing the other hard ones now ya know you know III I think it's nonverbal actually I've extremely loyal team that works worked very very hard and you know we're very competitive we want to be better than everybody and it doesn't happen by not showing up I think we have a great loyal team of people that we've built that every day show up and work hard and they're very they're very loyal to myself in the company which is uh we don't take that for granted it's uh we can't we can't do it without the team yeah nice nice okay - only two more for you - left okay top celebrity CEO professional athlete or living dead or live just top person in general that you wish you could meet and what would you just go yeah which person and then what I would discuss with them yep either you would want to meet that's currently living or if someone that's no longer living like you wish you was an interesting guy you know and I'm not I'm not I I work on a Microsoft machine so I'm not like one of these Apple people but I've read well I have an Apple iPhone I have an iPad but I'm not I say heavily bias towards being Apple but I in hindsight because I didn't pay attention as much when he was alive in hindsight reading books he's an interesting fellow that was very driven and I think it would entertain me to to sit with him and chat just because he had such a from my perspective a little bit of an eccentric very very focused d\u00e9m\u00e9ter and uh you know a being that he's not around that that's something that we we can't do now anymore so I would probably be high on the list most definitely did you read his book well not his book but the plaque I read I read a Jacobsen biography and that was it was pretty pretty pretty good I didn't know a lot of the backstory to be honest before the book but that's what kind of intrigued me uh did I give you an to give you a more negative connotation or just like a mixed feeling about him with the fact that he's this genius but then you know some people question that he treated people a certain way right maybe they say you know I think for me I took from it my family family is important I'm a great wife I have a two-year-old son as my brother works with us so family is very important I was disappointed to hear how bad he was with his family you know I don't idolize people that have the most money you know when you die it doesn't matter how much money you have so I was disappointed to see how especially as a foster child that he wasn't better with his own daughter because you know he basically replicated things that was that was really disappointing and then the other part was it's great that you're driven and you want to push the best out of everybody but for me being on who the hell it might have selphie job but like it was disappointing to see how negative a lot of his employees were like he did they got resist he got results out of some of these individuals but when they were done they were many of them worked were turned off by his mannerism that for me it's kind of like okay how can you the channel that the positive part of this individual where you get the best out of the people that work with you but you have some quality with your family and you know when when it's all done from a work perspective you have relationships in place and you know that you know the success is a success Apple's fantastic right I mean he was part of you know great inventions but you know I know those two things were really things that I took away we're okay let's replicate the success but let's let's try to be more well-rounded where when it's all said and done for myself that you know I don't have corporate employees saying the things that they said and I want to be there for my family yeah I know very well said man I took that nugget out that you said but I don't idolize people for their money that's great then great we think I like their last one what is a daily habit that you were just most dialed into to keep yourself on top as CEO of future technologies I I think you know just number one you know just showing up every day bring energy set the example put the effort in and you know whether my task for the day is uh something that's clerical or if it's negotiating the biggest contract you know bring it to each one of those activities be a winner and you know show that example about you know being there the long hours doing the things that are necessary and contribute to the team I mean yes to try to lead by example I mean not not everything I do is great but I would think that my team would say that I show up every day and I bring it and that's that's important all right awesome Peter well dude I definitely appreciate the time today appreciate you coming on the show and you know guys out there and Linkedin go connect with Peter kept yellow on LinkedIn will tag him here below so go connect with them and of course if you any more questions reach out to either of us and I think you guys for tuning in thanks Peter hey thanks girl appreciate it man amen I guess have a good rest of the Thursday they live viewers thank you so very much for

so much for tuning in today I'll hope you guys have a great wonderful rest of the day and remember that thing that you're working on that project that you've been putting off stop procrastinating it's not worry about the strategy the strategy can come late or just start executing just start doing go out there and do stuff guys thanks have a great day guys headphones off do it [Music] you", "qxOmLwTMVNU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] cheers now we're doing it again for a visual experience so real that your sound stereo system awakens a stunning cinema-like pdaf technology while the periscope telephoto lens easily turns every photo into art [Music] you", "aHftmh3-OYk": "all right so today we are gonna be doing ace I'm gonna be doing a video on the legendary RC car and we're gonna tap out on my truck I have a little one right over on the road so it hasn't let LED lights I've put controller right here I got you guys all strapped up to my car so that's why you can't see the car but I'll show you like the end of the video but we're gonna go on my lonely mini track I'm gonna test this out you'll see how it does Oh also if you're new to the channel make sure to LIKE and subscribe and yeah join Xbox one Xbox one hashtag death Xbox line hashtag death hot so we're also gonna have a part two on my second channel which is video man which is my old channel which I used to do videos on but yeah so so far were like a couple minutes in the video we're gonna be doing the top speed of this I make sure I guess what the top speed is on this car I'm gonna get a Traxxas X max I'm gonna get so many RC cars you guys you're gonna want to join my team let's go [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so my battery just died so I'm gonna have to gonna charge it and then I'm gonna do a part two for this um probably like later tonight or tomorrow and then I'm gonna go full-speed hitting off ranch going up ramps and stuff so hope you guys enjoyed today's video actually I'm just gonna show you guys the car Oh quick so I broke the body on it uh we just ordered a new car um yeah so basically we're gonna try to keep the old body sure guys she right there that's how it's broken then here's the back got the side view he got that view you got the light view got another set of lights in you here's the under view there's none of you all right guys so like I promised is going to show you that's gonna end today's video peace", "fsDPi5KxITo": "so today we're going to talk about setting up the yavi cell advisor 5g for beam analysis the default screen is a spectrum analyzer so let's hit the mode button in the upper left corner and let's change this to 5g nr and beam analyzer from here i'll give it a simple name so we'll know what to call it later we call it ba1 enter select beam analyzer hit done and let the tool change to the beam analyzer mode from here we just need to enter the channel or the frequency i'll go with the channel number on the top of the screen there are some shortcut buttons i'm going to select the channel button and then channel number enter in my channel number 665 apply from here we're going to take the screen on the next shortcut which is our preamp and we're going to turn on the preamp so we'll go attenuation to zero we want to set our attenuation to zero when we're dealing with millimeter wave because of the sensitivity of the receiver we're also going to turn on our premium from here i just tap on the screen and that side screen goes away and now we just need to set the beam analyzer up to the specs of the 5d signal we're looking at so we're going to look at the bandwidth select bandwidth come over here to bandwidth ssb and you'll see that the cell advisor can do either low band fr1 frequencies or high band fr2 today we're going to look at high band and high band can be 100 megahertz wide signal or a 50 megahertz wide signal and your subcarrier spacing can be 60 120 or 240. in this case we're going to use 240 for the signal that we're analyzing i hit apply once you do that the analyzer will then look for the center channel of the beams and start displaying them on the screen if for some reason you don't have your display set up like mine you re-select the bandwidth you come down to search type select full roster and hit the auto button this will scan the entire 100 megahertz signal and look for the location of the beams itself takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes depending on the location and once it finds it it'll auto set up the signal tap on the screen and you'll start to see the beams across the screen on the left side of the screen the dark blue one will be rsrp for the given pci and in this case our pci is 315 and you can see we have a beam index of 14. so we can look at our rsrp on the secondary sync and the rsrp on the primary sync as well as secondary sync synar and lastly we do an rsrq measurement so right across the screen you'll see we have up to eight different beams that are able to be shown and upon recording we can record up to 64 views so to record in the screen you hit the save button on the right side you select log to csv give it a name and we'll call it save one hit enter and hit save and now the unit is recording all of its stats and all of the measurements to a csv file this runs automatically with a gps timestamp as well as gps location when you're satisfied with your recording you tap anywhere on the screen and if you'd like to save it you hit yes if you don't want to save it you hit no and if you want to keep recording you hit continue i just recorded that file and it's now in file and that's setting up the beam analyzer on the yabi solutions cell advisor 5g find out more at vicon's website you", "PbpWyrsRRJQ": "[Music] I'm here at Mobile World Congress Los Angeles at the erickson booth I'm with Neil speak Lynn from Ericsson and we're talking about Erikson's investing in 5g and working with its customers so first of all how is Ericsson investing in helping its customers bring 5g networks and services to market so far about they have done them together with their customers is deploying non standalone being quite successful with that so I am too and we have around 71 agreements 34 announcements the contracts officially my press releases 20 networks like then for standalone which is the next step in then in the 5e evolution is my solution area is developing totally new cloud native software offered what we call dual mode five-year cloud corner we'd read cloud native software then we can have a totally different agility in speed both have we developed the software but also how our customers operators deploy the software their new capabilities like doing in service software upgrade doing canary testing instead of doing a number of software upgrades per year doing it by maybe a monthly that's one opportunity with cloud native software secondly we also have optimation like an epic slice things later on Muse in there most of the damn food slicing and capabilities how you can set up different slices in an artwork in all eternity for the operators to provide different greater political service to different applications okay and how about the the the co innovation side so how is how is Ericsson working with its customers more closely to sort of bring these these solutions to market of course the tactical innovate together with their customers in order to do things beyond 3d people which is the standard so it's super important to be have all the open interfaces defined in 3d people and also using open source and when we using open source we did do upstream firsts all the changes we do source we contribute to CN CF and in order to reuse it then we also try to do things beyond that in order to innovate new stuff with the echo system okay it's definitely a new way of working well Neil's thanks very much for spending the time with us I appreciate it [Music]", "Yd3sFL-dhL4": "[Music] hello my name is Tony Chan for telecom TV I'm here at the Qualcomm 4G 5g summit in Hong Kong with me today is Enrico Salvatori who is the president of Hong Kong for a beer Enrico thank you for joining us thank you for every meal at the conference today I think we had something like eight operators come out and talk about the 5g strategy why do you think they here in sharing the 5g experience 15 is a major innovation step in technology for the ecosystem for the breeders for the infrastructure vendors for us working on the device side for partner so the excitement for all of us is about introducing the new technology and the benefit of the new technology to the users so the operators are here to present a plan to understand where we are as a technology vendor on the handset infrastructure vendors we had also on the stage they Ericsson talked about their plan and to share with us where they are in developing and implementing the network and the services and also they are here because they want to listen when the device will be ready that is our job we erected so for for Coke I mean obviously there's a lot of emphasis on 5g why do you think it's so important for the totems industry so G is important for the users because will bring more data rate capacity low latency introducing new service application like mission-critical but is very important also because 4G has been designed to connect objects things so we also here are presenting some of those implementation like automotive so you can have the cellular communication vehicle to vehicle vehicle to network vehicle to infrastructure that will in safety in the cars so reducing the level of accident and this is also indirectly benefit for all of us but is also connecting all the conductors automotive is just one example so for the actual users themselves I mean what can they look forward to like from the consumer perspective and personally enterprise perspective I mean we hear about things like flying cars and and like virtual reality obviously I mean are these things can become reality very soon yeah let's start from upgrading services application we already have and then we can go to new things that we are trying to predict so in terms of in upgrading what we do have with the MVP that is the mobile broadband increasing capacity up to the 10 gigabit per second obviously you can achieve performance like making available data into the cloud and then you can access to those data from your device without storing the data in the device so no pictures no music no video because you can do real-time thanks to the high data rate from the cloud that's an improvement that will impact also the device meaning that probably less memory will be needed in the device and memory means reducing the below material of the device this is one example but of course is also a real-time because of the low latency so applications that are requesting low latency like he held so having access from remote to robots that you can control having the same reaction at the same time of the command so that that is another major improvement mission-critical services so like such recovery you can access drones or machines something like the Avatar movie you can control from remote to the the machine with the perform perception or what will be done so there are application from one side starting from the classic smartphone improvement in terms of performance to introducing new service and application we mentioned Sam we can add also the VRA are so exact today we saw a quite intriguing and interesting presentation from next we are so that you can improve the immense immersive experience from a sport event with a content like if you are really personal thanks to this high capacity low latency performance of the network I know kocoum is known for being very technically advanced compared to the rest of the industry and also to accelerate the adoption and an evolution of industry you know can you talk a little bit about what cocom is actually doing to help accelerate the industry towards 5g things like spectrum for example things like reference designs well Qualcomm is a company that is delivering technology so our DNA is about innovation innovation in technology Qualcomm is doing a lot now 5g but they did even more in preparing 5g because we have been part of the 3gpp standard aspects definition we have been a part of the acceleration of the specs because the original plan for 5g was to have a deployment in 2020 2021 well now we achieved with the industry with the ecosystem first alpha 19 that device will be ready infrastructure will be ready operators and spectrum so the specs has been finalized in December 17th then we move from that space respects to the product so implementing Minear to recession in the board first in the reference design into the chipset in the product that is now available in engineering sample but will be available in commercial quality to the our customer by the end of the year so that they can deliver the smartphone by first quarter second quarter 2019 what about beyond the device itself with the operators themselves I know you have many many partners who are operators not just the people making the smartphones what are you doing to help them actually on their journey because they have to navigate all the different versions different kind of network deployment scenario spectrum management and all that I know Qualcomm does a lot in that area but you don't publicize it too much well in order to be part of the standard suspects that I was describing the standardization we have a engineering not only at level of the device the product but also system level so we can work with riddling we work with them talking about feature set for the device but also in terms of frequency band what is the configuration of the net or millimeter wave is a big news coming with a 5 g sub 6 the driven for 3.7 so that they can work in trying to predict performance propagation working with them about the impact on the network configuration of course we are not a network infrastructure vendor but our system level engineering is in a position to provide support to the breeders in sizing and predicting what is the the configuration of the network and working with them to optimize the configuration our network but even the moment there is a lot of discussion collaboration about having at the same time and the sub 6 and the millimeter wave deployment because really 5g has been designed to use both sub 6 and millimeter wave frequency bands so you want to have the full capacity the full power the full performance of the FFG in your network this is what we are sample discussing with the operators supporting them during the trial supporting them do the testing specifically now we are in the middle of the what we call the IOT interoperability testing so that we go in the lab with over with the infrastructure vendor partner and the operator is testing the prototypes our reference design the MTP and they predict they have a sense of the performance so that they can start creating services application tariff plan related to the new 5g devices coming with your compositions at this event with the operators what would probably the one thing that you would in advise them when they're thinking about 5g first of all to make as soon as possible available frequency spectrum so auction for the frequency spectrum has to be completed as soon as possible in a team in order to go in a commercial phase in 19 we are operating in Europe I'm responsible for the operation of Qualcomm Europe in Europe we have a countries that already completed that Spain Italy UK other countries are still working it like France and Germany so very important for the operators not miss the train to make sure that the frequency band will be available in order to move the commercial phase then of course to be open mind in terms of working with the new industry players new to the wireless system not new in terms of agency because Fuji is really grating a foundation an infrastructure a precondition for connectivity that is embracing industry players that were not part of the 4G so more and more on the automotive more and more on the industry automation you saw also the show that we invaded Iran on the stage at the keynote by Cristiano to have players that are not really from the classic traditional 3gpp or wireless security system but that's the the richness of these 5g technology great Thank You Rico [Music]", "HNtteRHJKsE": "so that gear is for 15 seconds trying something new today and i am going can i get this one just randomly put it in tap it up and go into blue 15 seconds doesn't matter it doesn't have to be perfect i just want a little bit backgrounds on it okay good this one away and this one away and that's using my unicorn to this dust off and you don't have to be perfect perfect absolutely not necessary and then i'm gonna using this so this uh gel painting i did use crimson red and magenta's blue and i just mixed this with a little bit of the white to mix like the color a little bit lighter so let me show you quick for a lot of you using it the on the other day's video of sarah washing is really great as well is great tip and trick where is my okay my stolen two so for instance i mix it already but if you can get at a little bit the white if you want to say if you want your red to be a little bit more like a red not too deep red you can do a little bit brighter red you can mix it just a little bit of pigments with the white and it's just you know it's soft in your colors so same thing with the blue as well and i mix it already like say if i take some white and pick some white on this side and add just a little bit of blue and you can see that it's gonna make the blue it's just lighter you see what i'm in like instead of just dark blue so but i mix it a little bit so then it make it uh the color is a little bit brighter so i am going to play with the fireworks that i playing it's a little bit earlier so if a lot of you is not sure even this one you can draw with a lot of different firewalls so you can either sketch like um you can do it like this to make it easy for you like give it some dot you don't have to but you're not sure then this will give you some guy lie much easier you feel like to make it look so nice on your um fireworks i'm gonna get a piece of paper thank you and i'm gonna do the same thing clean my brush you can do the same thing with the blue but we're going to let's do the red first and then we're going to do the blue in just shortly so i am saturating my brush with the gel painting so you're going to leave a little bit pressure and you're going to release it so hold it and you're going to release it same thing with this okay so hold on so i will show make sure that i can show you easier same thing and you can do is the same and it's repeated can you make it move closer here is that closer and make sure you're doing it like from outside in instead of inside out now if you want the blue i'm going to flash gear this quick because i'm going to add the blues on it just 10 seconds i am going to using loading my brush with the blue and then let's go in you can do it longer for the fireworks it looks super cute so you hold like give your pressures it's hard to explain but then it's really simple though you hold it and then you just release it so then it give it like nice soft stroke and you're going to repeat it's the same thing with the other parts all right i'm gonna put crystal right in the middle of this it's i'm showing step by step so so a little bit take time flash here for 10 seconds but if i doing it with if i doing it i will do like um uh like all part of the black uh of the red first and then the move on to the blue so between different colors i am clean my brush if you're seeing it i clean it just with the top coat and just dissolving my all the color residues there and then you can go into the next one you can do another one here another one here so again i'm gonna repeat this and again you can do like one two three four you see that and like that is gonna give you like so um much easier to imagine that too i'm gonna go into this one right in the center one two this is like really um easy if you feel like it's hard for you to remember where you're gonna draw your so if you just give you a guidance of this one two sorry lots of firework there you go so now we're gonna go in with our red you're going to press a hold this in wherever you want to do and then release it i just want just a little bit on the background we did earlier with the chrome i just want just a little bit of something in the background nope this one there you go so i'm gonna go ahead and do with the next one too this one we're doing a little bit smaller because getting closer to the end of the nails there's less space for us to walk also we want like it looks like so we're going to do like smaller stroke if you're using the same like technique like this you can draw like daisies flowers really simple as well we're going to do that like after july 4. together you might finish the last one right there i'm going to flash you quick for of 10 seconds",

I'm saying so there's the Chargers connected to the RC car [Music] howdy daddy's going that's a really dumb question whoa whoa I have to find a way anything turn this off for now I have no idea what this does because it's just like thing but it looks like this nope that's a bunch don't buy my eggs it's fun talking to you know like probably nobody watches my videos stop it yeah I can't find screwdriver oh let's turn this Thurston but like see what I'm talking about see the cheddar is just gonna get in the way so yeah that's basically it for this video right yes five likes and I'll go do this gate park and just sleep ward or rounder well obviously in the summer when it stops snowing and it's nice out but I'll definitely go to a skate park been tried very much controlled cars there but not my Viking stuff because I'm gonna wait till the summertime do that so yeah thank you for watching and have a great", "aT-iU_xRItM": "working with our customers on developing the next generation of 5g handsets we're finding that integration around the antenna and the entire our front-end really is is a key trend and that's because you know there's a lot of new frequency bands to cover we're covering all the 4G or LTE bands and now adding 5g bands sometimes a new spectrum and sometimes we're using 4G spectrum but there's also requirements for E and DC which is dual connect technology allowing you to use for G and 5g bands simultaneously it's a great benefit to the system operators in terms of efficiency the network and also for the users you'll have seamless connectivity but it really drives up the complexity of the RF front end and to get those products to market efficiently with high performance it turns out integration is very very helpful there so the handset manufacturers not having to do a lot of work on the board itself highly integrated modules from Corvo and others can help get those products to market faster and with high performance", "6-b6p9L_2BQ":

so I mean your company is is well known for its high speed small form-factor modules and you'll hear at the show talking about your new range of 400 gig products you just tell us a little bit about that and and while you're delivering these to the market now sure so we've got three products we're demonstrating at the show right now at 400 gig we have a 400 gig lr8 module it's a 10 kilometer reach module that actually will go into production and q2 of this year we expect it to be the first 400 production module in the market we have a 400 gig dr4 module which is four lanes of a hundred gig targeted at 500 meter applications for inside the data center and we actually have a demonstration an early demonstration of 400 gig er8 module which is a duplex fiber 40 kilometer interface which is the first of its kind to be demonstrated in the industry so we've developed a wide range of products covering everything from inside the data center to routing and client-side transport applications and 400 gig ok we're quite excited about the initial adoption of these products from the hyperscale data centers as well as some of the lead OEMs in the routing space and believe that over the next few years these are going to really become mainstream products in the industry so of course that's not all that you're showing here FC 2019 can you tell us a bit more in general about market developments and what are the kind of products we can expect to see from source photonic sure well 400 gig is definitely the future but as much of the industry knows we have been the industry leader on the hundred gigglin WDM portfolio and a small form-factor it was originally the QSB 2800 gig lr4 and what we've done here over the last year has really expanded that portfolio into a very wide range of products that can serve a much larger variety of applications than the lr4 could serve we now have a multi rate LR for product shipping and production that can serve the transport market we have 40 kilometer Ethernet and multi rate products that can support more Metro applications in the Asian market we have single lambda hunger gig products that should serve the next generation of 100 gig data center connectivity and we've also released a second generation 100 gig CWDM for product that we believe will be priced competitive with every other player in the industry so we have significantly expanded our hundred-day portfolio in addition to our 400 gig developments okay and and any new sort of products that you're bringing to market things that you haven't been out there and offering before yeah so the 100 gig year for light is one that were shipping in production this year it's a 40 kilometer 100 gig product the 100 gig otu 4 is also a new product that we are now shipping in 2019 for multi rate LR for support and then we've got a wide range of 5g capable products for front hall and mid hall well let's talk about that because obviously you know even at OFC 5g you know is a big topic a big trend I think some people outside looking at this going it's an optical show why people talking about 5g so so how does the company light source photonics play into the 5g ecosystem yeah as speeds have increased in the core networks and the metro networks they've also had to increase in the link rates required to go from the base station to the radio units and a wireless now that actually drove transformation from electrical connectivity to optical connectivity in 3G and LTE networks almost seven to ten years ago source photonics was actually the leader at the time and shipping six gigabit and ten gigabit transceivers for 3G and LTE networks in the front hall and now as we go to 5g that bandwidth requirement grows even further so we are releasing a suite of products that are going to operate at 25 gigabit per second that will serve the front hall application the connectivity between the base station unit and the radio units but there's also going to be the introduction of mid hall connectivity that's going to allow the base stations to communicate with each other and get some kind of edge compute into the network and we're developing a wide range of 50 gig in 100 Gig products that are going to serve mid hall connectivity requirements in the 5g networks ok so I think it's I mean it's absolutely critical that in in the 5 G's story that the market doesn't forget that the transport behind the radio access network is just as important as that finest final wireless connection that's absolutely right today's backhaul networks will not serve the the backhaul needs of 5g networks and the physical infrastructure actually isn't even in place yet to serve the mid hall needs and that's enabled new conversation and new products to emerge to provide the right speeds and the right form factors to serve this new generation of edge compute that's gonna be required in the 5g networks ok in the same way as hundred gig is an enduring story that we're still talking about now and have been for years and we're going to be talking about 5g for some time to come look forward to catching up next year and seeing how that has developed a

Evaluations of the over-the-air performance\nof wireless devices for frequencies up to 6 GHz are well standardized and can be performed\nby a large number of laboratories. In addition, mmWave test systems are currently\nbeing developed by test equipment manufacturers for testing 5G NR FR2 enabled devices - and\nother systems operating above 6 GHz. In this video, we introduce the first set\nof phantoms and fixtures designed to be compatible with any mmWave chamber that provides a quiet\nzone of 30 cm or larger. This new mmWave phantoms set is the two-hand\ngrip phantom package \u2012 or in short called \u201cmmW-THG phantom package\u201d \u2012 for mobile\ndevices used in gaming or landscape mode operating  at frequencies above 6 GHz. The features are the following:\nThe hands are fully compliant with the CTIA target values for human hands for\nthe 3 \u2012 6 GHz frequency range. The hands also have a low-loss coating\nthat mimics the matching effects of the the dead layer of the skin - and extends the maximum\nfrequency to over 110 GHz without having an impact on the OTA performance below 10GHz. Second, the cut in the hand to position the\ndevice inside the hand was extended as requested by the CTIA Near-Field Phantom sub-working\ngroup to have more realistic contact areas between the hand and the phone. Third, the set is easily assembled: The hand phantoms are connected to the corresponding wrist with a click mechanism. The wrists are made of high-density foam to\nensure minimal reflection of electromagnetic radiation. And fourth, the hands with the wrists are\nthen mounted on the fixture. We have minimized the reflections by reducing\nthe amount of material used in the mounting fixture as much as possible. Once the phone is fixed between the phantom\nhands, the entire set can be mounted on the turntable. The OTA manual can be downloaded from our\nwebpage and provides detailed instructions on the assembly and alignment procedure. More phantoms compatible with the same fixture\nwill be introduced in the coming months.

supposed to watch some it's like dude I can't read subtitles I don't understand Japanese like of course I'm doing that no don't watch them watch dubbed anime under any certain things unless this ask the same right cuz that's when we cut em all out Jackie Doug animate the devil do not watch them anime bro I just won here in English what's the problem with that okay like chill yeah okay you forced my hand [Music] listen here right now you watch one piece from episode 1 numero uno in sub you will never watch dubbed anime again oh we sucked its I ever ever catch you watching dubbed enemy again I will shoot you dead and leave you in a ditch for Itachi's subbed throws to be them do you understand shut up subbed better than dubs subs is better to conduct some is better than dubbed", "8zoDMdQjft0": "yo what is up as you can see by the title of this video I am starting the podcast the one piece an anime podcast so it's gonna be a little bit different from the channel because obviously the content segments are gonna be longer but it's gonna go beyond that in the differences so beyond just talking about events that happened in the anime or manga just like the cold hard facts of what has happened in discussing it I'm gonna take it a step further in some episodes and be talking about war concept bound ideas so things like perceptions and stereotypes and what people think of anime stands or fans or weaves you know what people call them so that's basically what the podcast is gonna be about I'm gonna be talking mostly one piece maybe even all of them peace but also some of those conceptual ideas maybe sometimes talking about other series if I find them interesting enough you know just like this channel in that regard so I'm gonna put the link to the podcast channel down in the description it's gonna be releasing every Saturday and Tuesday 6 p.m. est on YouTube and Google podcasts so link in the description check it out if you want to because I would really appreciate that it's kind of a new project and I'm excited about it to talk about it it's gonna be a solo podcast but I'm gonna have guests on it frequently I'm gonna have guests a lot so it's not just gonna always be me talking so yeah if you like the idea of a podcast if you want to listen go check it out in the link below I would appreciate that and yeah 6 p.m. every Tuesday every Saturday 6 p.m. est starting tomorrow I'm gonna be dropping the first episode tomorrow so yeah thank you for watching this video cuz I'm not gonna stop doing this channel I'm gonna be doing both of them like kind of alternating I guess obviously I'm not gonna be posting on this channel on Tuesday or Wednesday or Tuesday or Saturday most likely but I'm not gonna drop a channel activity will die a little bit of course but probably not all that much if I stop or decide to stop posting on the channel of course I'll let you guys know but yeah I'm gonna see y'all in the next video", "QC_XCWhEuAY":

gentleman my name is Yvonne I'm from the D corporation today I'm very happy to be here to present the city comedy solution which is driving by your call quality as you may already know that in five G we have three main scenarios which is GM BB grr C and our MTC the MVP will provide 10 gigabits but Netto cabana boys and you RC will provide one currently one millisecond latency emember TC will provide one million connections poor square kilometers so I'm EC is the important part to support these key features which especially for the URL see without I mean C is not possible to provide a 1 million one one millisecond latency and also om VB we will need am easy to optimize the network for traffic flow which can reduce backhoe traffic load and also I mean C will accelerate innovation by providing a lot of rich capabilities of network and IT capabilities so but still we have challenges with an easy firstly we have to think about how to introduce our third party applications this kind of this server obligations may need different running environment like a parameter virtual machine and containers also some of the applications will need hardware acceleration to reduce the latency cost by the computing computing process so this like like the ARV are for the network network transmission of no forwarding and graphic video processing also steadily how to deploy I mean see easily and how to people are missing application easily in the in the place of the in the place over of the network which has very limited results like powers space and personal skills so in the following slide I'm going to show you how the comedy solution fulfill this challenge totally in this slide I'm going to show you the overview of the city comedy solution generally have four layers one layer is a unit wrong layer which is a hard work composed by is a different kind of servers and there it's a commercial off-the-shelf server it was much too big a server with stunts with a steam defined low latticed a network equipment on top of the rock layer we have virtualization layer which which which is aligned with OpenStack in cambium with kubernetes we can provide the para metal overture virtual machine and the canina virtual machine Canadian virtual machine on top of that the part about the virtual virtualization layer we have platform layer this layer provided different capabilities I love the part that we have to F it away and UPF which provides a local local traffic apricot functionality which reduce which is used to reduce the network network latency and right party we have the network capability from which provide the post city capabilities and IT capability like we don't read UNIDO in information services like a location-based services and TCP optimization this belongs to the city domain but also we have the capability like a video optimization and different IPP management capability also we have I'm right with ID mano and every man a VM to allow thus simplified deployment and on top of the platform layer we have application layer here we have different obligations made from different vendors so in summary we have focusing on the fossee which is a connection which provided by the UPF and different gateways also cloud by the OpenStack and kubernetes a computer compute which we have different computing resource all different hardware acceleration capability and capability to a density demon then let's see how ZT provided to call Corey engine to enable the flexible flexible resource scheduling here are normally when we talk about with your machine engineers we will think about OpenStack and kubernetes normally we have OpenStack and kubernetes separately with two favorite resort pool but here we we work on the solution is a converging of in stock and the kubernetes we share a lot of components like a keystone like Alexander and Newton so that so that we can create mixed cloud it's a one cloud this cloud can provide different kind of resources with if if you provide open style and kubernetes life really which means is to Club its to cloud the hardware cannot be shared network has to be interconnected it's not the one under one network and suddenly on a hardware layer this this OpenStack and kubernetes Akash our computer and definis storage like a safe storage and a disgrace then we have researched aloud to the acceleration hotter acceleration we have invested a lot of human resource in the cyborg also we have collaborated with inter and Malick's who work as a hardware acceleration from a smart card and also we work together with a media just about the GBO acceleration also the D as far as the hard work is concerned we have our own hardware acceleration card like we have two different two different kind of hardware acceleration car which is because martinique why is to support the gpo of loads which is specifically used by the pillory and UPF also we have we have a standalone car which support the obvious of loads which can support a standard obligation to improve the network capability and reduce a time delay for the for the computing part the amici deployment and application team on deployment we have two different ways so I mean see especially for the forage we would like to recommend to have a all-in-one machine which which can be delivered by XPrize company and you can just plug and play and this this this I mean see and automatically register in the company you know configuring server which is located in the network core network and and then the configuration server will distribute the configuration file and automatically the IMEC will start the configuration and then this these armies will work on other hand application deployment we have two different ways wise we use simplified our veo every view is the standard component which is in which is in the architecture which is simply a deal you can easily you education and to generate we will provide a tool to generate whistle we have D files so that you can easily import the idea of negation RT application and deploy advisor avail but also we provide ideal way to introduce the applications which is provided by we call application management which is our product director so that you can with this component U K sub square bros resource from the cloud which is like public cloud service carbons with cloud and upload application image and you can start the deploy people you can select select which location you would have to deploy anything you can start the deployment this nearly full automatic here advertisement we city Ave I we have more than 500 applications in the global market and also we have more than 60 collaboration collaboration in 5g to men also we have model 15 amis the applications applications in the market the I would love to show you some case study this is what we have time is France Telecom in Spain and we have we have started project on 18 and we have to try the real which is voice over and we know June we have we have successfully make a demo of holographic video call here you can see that we with this holographic call you can see a person which is standing in front of you and like a real person and it's fake right right the left part the last person is a fake fake fake man also we have a bigger project work together with China Mobile which is the inbounder branch and we have as you know that China Mobile is very big operators here we have four different for I mean see which has been deployed in four different locations the access room access room aggregates room and at our aggregate and qarun we have deployed together with our partner for different kind of applications which like here in exercise room we have home dog park it's we're together with Honda Honda and we twice of it works application and we together with a Mac and the naturalizing function we provide a low latency capability aggregated room we work together with patients we provide high definition content CDN and cloud gaming and also we have worked with honkala with radio broadcasting like a live TV services and the in German call Karen we have worked with aspire we have provides the facial facial recognization function this is the first first amici deployment with Duke home which is kubernetes and we start arranging and the hardware acceleration with DT obvious and gdb acceleration car this is ladies reward we got from the global industry the first was the fact excellence which we just received from from 2000 and he at the end we will Congress in Netherland and great great release to commercial potential for computing conserved awarding the 2008 computing Congress in London okay here's a summary of our takeaway in general a DD commodity solution provides three main features which I presented being the powerful car engine which we prepare we brought OpenStack the features into the key Bernadette's so there's the concern even component and provide a unified cloud and we can provide parameter which we share our continuous simultaneously also we can support hydrogenous acceleration provided by gigi accelerating car a hard work i'll third party her third party hard work and also remember that i missing in fire you had to be easy to deploy and fun application and has had to be easy to deploy and also we need a centralized management is in a central location we we have we cannot have those good people you know fine okay this is all my presentation any questions thank you", "Oofzd7K2ULY": "we have a very holistic approach to 5g development where we look at it through the lens of convertible concept systems to develop the hardware to a point where it is mature enough for commercial requirements we look at devices how do we would only enhance the smartphones but enable this new category or categories of devices we look at spectrum we look at the technology itself we are very active in 3gpp n or any other industry forums and then we look at use cases what are the ones that make sense for us so that we can analyze and evaluate what the benefit would be for the consumer and what the benefit would be for us so not just consumer but customer in general so we've learned a lot in the last three years and I think I have time to go through all of those learnings but I will touch upon some of the key points so with that first of all when it comes to technology now lab testing we've been able to validate all the key technology components associated with 5g things such as massive MIMO beamforming being switching low latency operating in millimeter wave frequencies we may take those two for granted today but they are foundational for 5g and it's very important that we were able to validate that those things work but without that 5g wouldn't be what it's going to be so that's a huge milestone in my mind that kind of a take away any concerns and some on some of these new technologies maybe not being feasible in the future they all are", "G1EvpvhdbtA": "anime fans one piece and what's good answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good today we have another live stream with our friend vulture Valley you be sure to subscribe to his channel link is in the description so today's topic is on my man sup how strong is up I think this top is stronger so most people think I think if so unlike even Charlotte oven pull it up on you stop and tried to blitz him or something like that I think we saw that see what actually they're pretty well against its own like oven or someone like that should go and be easily be able to escape them if he plays his cards great even possibly win since optical smart but well sure it's a gift you will let him go for okay I guess I'm arguing the opposite yeah I really don't believe that Gustav has has a defensive capabilities to like physically I haven't seen I we've seen that he's gotten stronger per se like being able to use bigger attacks and offensive capabilities and he's more of a toolbox utility type of guy he can fix problems that aren't necessarily combat related like fixing the Sonny in case Frankie's gone or building some kind of random machine that they need you know whatever at the time like mommy's climb attack that's not like low leveled stuff that's actually pretty impressive and he integrated with the dials that's more his speed but if someone would like someone like Sanji knew he had to kind of move as fast as he did when he went against oven when sandy was on hole caking at a speed blitz oven that's when I that's what I see coming from the top through people if there was a those are long drawn-out fight and Ivan actually saw Sanji I think it would be like a mid diff for Sanji and anything that's mid difference on G is extreme diff Russa this is how I see and is it goes case-by-case of course because one piece is about matchups but generally anyone with hockey it's one if one did they have one of the hockey he's gonna have a hard time if they have both it's gonna be tied if and if they have a devil fruit on top of that like Sabu he I don't see him coming out of that at all you know without his big plot on there cuz because he is a star hit well first of all this wasn't going to bring up I think this I think just might seem a little bit wings but in first of all you just will get without proton to get the man is ripped just being honest he's ripped because he was on the Isle fellas savage plant so he has really had to use them but its physical capabilities are actually pretty large compared to what he was from time skips as he has been running around the boy archipelago like he's Robin Hood yeah but at the same time you gotta think about a muscle mass and one piece Luffy was pushing buildings apart and he had the most stick for your arms when he won in the series he knew sob had the same exact build but Luffy was doing all the crazy stuff you probably even not I'm gonna say even before dumb fruit but we know that Luffy whole stuff back until like a big challenge comes so you know he was you know as strong as he was pretty much throughout post time skip from the beginning you know he grew after Rob Lucci and all those fights but the base strength it was crazy so Muslim ash doesn't have that much to do with it when it comes it's just that he looks cooler now and he's more confident and of course you got better but when you start from zero and you go up to 50 that's impressive but if everyone else is all 500 that's not it doesn't matter you know yeah very scheme of things observation haki seems to mean more it's not it doesn't seem to be as much of dodging and more of fencing the reason I brought up his muscle mass was I feel like that was his way of life physically showing in the drawing but you thought it's just faster and stronger now physically and along with observation haki I feel like even if it's not trained he's since he awakened it like Kobe it's going to be really strong and he's gonna be and right I don't think he realizes yet I think he's able of course to the best speculation is headcanon on my part but I think it was something to be able to dodge a lot of more things than he or we realize and so now you think he's so do you think this up has so right now like he basically flashed up like you know higher two characters do you think that's in his repertoire because if not then we have to seriously kind of like nerf him or curve our expectations because if he doesn't have sober and we really haven't seen anything about that we've more seen him do that thing really did when he swam all the way to Amazon Lilly and he sensed every creature on the island their power level ICU you saw being more in that vein than having you know the observation to or the the observation and the means to dodge high-level high-speed attacks I just don't see Matt I don't think that's this thing I think him and people him and I what's that Vaughn auger on the blackberry pirates I think I think they're gonna you know be doing that whole sniping from Islands thing that's gonna be his fight not close close range yeah and that that that's a skill and that's highly value but when you rank people for how strong they are you have to have to include close quarters combat and house you know I may be able to last and if we just look at that we could put them high for sniper skills because he's probably one of the best snipers in the verse but that's only gonna get you so far you know right but I think you supplement of having both sides because if you just look up beams weapon just be blunt if specialty has always been running away when he brewing thank you even dodging when he's in a bad situation he's able to evade you've always been a put that vain not always because if not alabaster he got messed up using a body cast for many I think he could meet up a lot you know cuz he had his nose broke that the whole body Castle what he got here with like a thousand pound hammer or some crazy like that or a bet yeah but hmm what you're saying is a fair point I don't think he's that unable to God but I think I still think he'd because for some people like Musante well those people are in that fastest on right not gonna be with a vein so I'm like Sanji for a long time but you can just some more lowers cop series like he doesn't look at offensive ability what I also really want to talk about what's his offensive ability even though he's long range like when he's in short range it's not like he sent people to duke it out with throwing like oven like he is able to keep able to snap off shots really quick me yes because of course the pro sure they are to you the easier they are to hit hey so part of this upright is his tactic was he's at disadvantage he uses tactic but he's been missing that before so if he's getting lit by throwing like oven and I do believe even their safeguard go aren't as impressive as I would have thought I still think I still think you'd be able to dog doesn't threaten me with a wild weed yeah I don't think well other than I think is slower I don't think this thing is speed so maybe oven and like nozzle speed based characters yeah so even if it goes to say for sake of the present King George oven or maybe 30 seconds or not even 30 dictate 10 seconds 5 seconds before other than cactuses oh is that code and what's up his goose top is able just rolling up ammo and snap off a shot and if you use its impact wolf remember that giant wolfy shot yeah that did that whole shock wave the reason that pricked him so long to you that was one for the height kind of he was aiming if I was right there and he just snap that off that's gonna send oven flying the other direction you know what I'm saying yeah able to snap it off but does the does the actual wolf shoot that fast as well we got to look at because remember it like it has to unfurl and that whole thing has to come out I did just instantly hit and then became a thing you know say say it wasn't even impactful because I feel like he's got to have some more interesting family like I just think his regular like little pellets if he was able to somehow like not put hockey on herself like maybe he has a smallest amount of army hockey that he can control but he knows how to do it like the Kuja do and like infuse his little pachinko with it I think I'll be able to you know be a good offensive with him as long as you know don't think that I would say holding him back from being like top tier and being able to even do that in the first place it's this physical ability like like we discussed before I can't hear you so can he do gear to level speed because most people that we can sort of strong have that you know I can do a little flash real quick and be fast as Lucia do you feel too but hey uh I can't we can't really make judgments on this physical abilities because um so for now I'm gonna say this second physical abilities are not up to par he's so fit enough so we say blue so say he's like say it oven or daifuku jeans or something like that but he's got if he's gonna dodge it and if he's able to snap off a foot ammo that repel for even like a little bit knock them back light can't be that he's instantly at the advantage because a they're farther who can use bigger and badder ammo and even if he can't be as their actor occupied for even just one second or a 0.5 seconds since Musab has been trained in sniper abilities he's going to able be able to snap off more ammo and and the more and once he I feel like once he gets them at that range he's gonna start he's gonna be able to bombard them but show they're far enough away or even maybe he only need 10 feet be something like impact smoke and one uses impact rope you might even be able to use something bigger than impact wolf you know impact offers the biggest thing we're seeing that's amusing but I feel like he's gonna be able to he's gonna be able to hold people off and even be able to combine them and destroy them with mr. bombardment I'm not saying he's the beat oven or daifuku necessarily but I'm saying she's gonna be with a defeat opponent to where he I'm saying he's stronger than we think and he's able to take on stronger opponents than we think he can take on most people seem to think so most people seem to think he can't even take on someone like Gladius or maybe not Gladius but they don't even think he can take on someone like say I don't even think you can pick on someone like Bartolomeo that won't be hard for anybody but if we was look at it like say you know do you have to look at the ranking system for the most like recent Yago we've taken off so we have daifuku of in cata curry cracker and smoothie and then we got you know jack and dim boys over in Cairo's crew so who's like like what level is oven and daifuku oh well we know they're weaker than third commanders there was like right under third commanders like they're the executives or the veterans I think they were called in the show so I don't know if what's-his-name I don't know if Gustav is necessarily dead low because I think if he can tangle with them that's cool he can probably get some hits in them the only thing that's lacking is his defense if I want to get a clean fire hit off a horse up I don't think he's dying but he doesn't know the tenkai like the iron body thing of off of one of those six powers that you know the suit of cp0 people use he doesn't have that he doesn't have actual body armor hockey and we definitely came to say you know he if he can't go full body if he can't even put up like his his forearms with it then there's a there's a lot of things that could possibly mortally wound us up and no matter how you look at how strong he's gotten weird we we can't say if he can tank these high level of people like a tax because signs you didn't even want to fight you know even like he if if son she was strong enough I'm sure he would have tried to take out of him you know at that point massage he didn't even feel confident that he can take out of in in a timely manner and he knew if I've been hit him it was gonna be a problem so we had to speed blitz him loose up isn't speed blessing him and he and if Sanji can't overpower Musab can't overpower him so I think he's like below whatever whoever's below oven and I fuku that's more true stops range and that's not necessarily weak because I mean yonkos crew even though veterans like right none of the commander's they're pretty strong my I think we all can agree with that so I would put him like so oven enough who had to be Mike his big mom than the three so they would be like what fifth and sixth and the crew and that's that's kinda where who's up it is like I don't see Nami Robin or chopper being really stronger and more useful than who's up so he's basically behind Brooke to me Frankie is up there to like he's pretty much fighting Frankie for like best best person like like fifth or sixth best person and then in Brookes in front of them I think Frank you stronger in the breath but that's what like a very different guy what what's his name is way older Lee Brooke is way older it has more experience I know Frankie did speed blitz anybody and he and you got to realize that Frankie Frankie's got strong armor and he's got Vega punk reason yes big monster that's offensive like we gotta remember the defense the defense is what's not it's metal like it's like technology metal it's not the heat is a special metal but you know like like you get a technology for his offense from the bigger Punk but he didn't get any new people laughing general Frank no always not you get about that yeah hold on yeah I forgot about you know Frankie but that's basically past the feast of love like it's just the strides pacifist ax and look how strong they were post times good if you think about it like ladies general Frankie like well I think he can be the pacifistic Ozora and sons you did it earlier but I think they got an upgrade but it wouldn't be a lo different Frankie like I think you would generally have a hard time with a pacifist if you think you can be okay or Akuma do you think you didn't like kuma himself cool mind though is stronger than doflamingo that is a lie so far we have to like get the world in a scope of power first so we got to iron out what we think is strong like you're obviously confused because Kuma's nowhere nation strong to do information without hockey doesn't mind anymore I mean like Sakuma that was that I mean Akuma that was that the bodies Akuma that was at thriller bark fat kuma was that kuma I'm not even gonna argue with you about this most we won't believe this but coolest part pads are at least as strong as year for pumpkins like I don't even I don't know I'm not saying he's weak it's just your when you bring up cumin most people who kind of do off now because yeah does my replace I'm going off you know the Combe that exist right now and Roma no it was not right Oh God but the one with the mind maybe because we don't know how many hockey's he's had we can say that he had armament and observation but can we say he's mastered them and you know how fast is he he's he can teleport instantaneously but when you have someone that has we've seen people be able to keep up with light speed so it's almost the same thing teleporting light speed so observation is not gonna be a problem we see how tough Delfy can be so of zorro it's taking all the pain that Lucy took over all that time and we know luffy's a tank so if Zorro can take that pain doflamingo can take that pain because he took organ damage so it's like I don't really see kuma overpowering doflamingo or outlasting him even though he does have a metal body Zoro cut through your body I don't think Sorrels cutting for doflamingo like that so it's like we've see we've seen the cap of their powers before with the pain to my to my injected Lucy's painting bizarre that was not the ping that was not the pain of his like of course it all must be paying over a lot in time yeah it was all the pain Lucy had through all out through the birds and that's a lot he he fought wars he had hundreds of different souls put inside him and duro had pain already so you're taking your pain and his fan so that's you know Matt and if those the bees dovie's abuse come on was basically able to one shot the entirety of thriller Martin and ok one more is exactly there was a primitive three time skip Luffy and it was like he'd beat over bunch of three times good doflamingo almost load if luffy if it wasn't for law and his gammon I have already ha I mean his powerbomb that power bond that can give a shot takes too long that's a 10 minutes you think dopamine goes in there and look at you while you do that inferred that Ursus claw at marineford took like but it was it wasn't as strong and then when he did throw the bark wasn't even like as strongest things we've seen before like it was a big bomb but like I'm pretty sure doflamingo with his awakened can do almost as much damage as there's a shot in fact actually let me digress from kumo for a little moment yes so I can say this and when I say that you're gonna groan but okay I know lots of people think I'm wild but it raucous Moria was definitely found the doflamingo he was at least first mate yong-chol level first calculate level in my opinion that no one statement of it Oh silicon let's listen here first of all Lauria got body by Kaito in the New World yeah so of course people ignore this but all throughout the realm of art it was obvious that it got in the press to giving up and stopped training for the last what 20 years and not 20 oh sorry up for the last like many years Carrasco is touched I am here's the thing sometimes one piece of this it gives the statement and then it's hard to like Jakarta wrapping my head around the statement so people so people ignore the statement but this is the fact like fit can say some real quick it's really so you're telling me that doflamingo is stronger than the first mate of a cat crew because ya don't feel Oh dist Maurya emery's worth no I said prom laureate oh okay not and also prom doesn't so prom doe fee is lower than prom Moria yeah the reason I say this is because I know let's talk say but Moria was because remember Moria 50 I guess title is around 55 60 like this is a fact because of course Qaeda was around and boreal we saw more II was that moderate execution and was grinning so we know that was about when Moria set off Moria was thanking with Kaido and that it was indicated more than once the mangas said he thought kind of equally wit could have been a typo but basically watching enjoyable but but basically what I'm saying is cuz I know for leg it was Yong Chi though like I think utamaru was always kind of on the lead inside but do you remember shadow that guard shadows Asghar was impressive but freakin uh what you call it Lucy if nightmare pre timescale luffy can beat him and there's absolutely no way he's on first amanda level because any first commander is beating nightmare Lucy no I'll just remember um so we saw that Kakashi shadows one punch was destroying the ground a people we get trilobites for the word Burke was one of my favorite art Moria isn't my top ten favorite characters but I'm not biased uh but the shadows are cards he was trying not to barf the shadows the whole time he couldn't even control it like when he did it you could see he was kind of like she's kind of gold it was like obvious she was just trying to buy time for you see to get burned up by the Sun right he could not control it like you only through like two punches wait patiently waiting but we've seen first commanders have excellent near perfect control we've seen people crocodile had more control and he always say that's where you go well that's that's going on Thanks you got shadows right uh-huh and shadows and I got a clue but I was like [ __ ] up - you got shadows after right Laurie has been kind of cut to da grease we discontinued but be nothing and crying and probably getting drunk over his Rock screaming maybe and you need practice T and you need to stay touch he could not control the shadows at card but if you got this Moria who was supposed to up in custom with Kaito this crime warrior he wanted to be the Pirate King that was his reason I'm pretty sure shadow that card would not be in his arsenal if he was not able to control it at some point in time if Mori was able to control each other's Asgard I have today that exceeds a lot we kind of branch off the shadows Asgard is impressive but we've seen before like auras like in Internet Wars or junior and endures when you're big in one piece yeah it's impressive but only up to a certain level and I would say little wars junior it was a very prominent figure in the white beard crew and doflamingo took him almost instantly and it's like be you you can't be too big that that has been proven unless you can become like a full armament haki freaking giant like you would if you would have to have next-level army because you're too big you're not fast enough speed kills that's why cheese rule isn't one of the top people that's why you gotta no air walk sometimes and so rude definitely like you can't not be fast and it's big yeah and I leave Oreos to be like like even if he did lose his shadows I don't think he'll be able to do enough damage to lure to people like I think about dopey going up in its shadow dance card he would just put one of his legs off now I acted on it that so first of all Moria dad sorry I lost my train of thought but shadow glass guard I said he would be it was controllable if you just look at times bass card I'm pretty sure he would be with a clap or their little world here like just one punch that wasn't even didn't seem to be a punch to put much effort into you seriously and so I feel like remember kind of jaga formed out of back and forth blow and laundry as they come I feel like shadows Asgard would be more to deal with that like if he's but if try to convert him in full-on bagging forms just ask I don't see the best way to deal with that all right I feel like it's only the same I feel like titles form is only good because he has a miscibility Factory no one could cut his legs off or take advantage of his size because he's way too big I mean way to be invincible if he was big and not invincible he would be tough but he wouldn't be like impossible to kill like he is now that's why Moria is kind of vibe what I'm saying is um prime Moria if you saw Moria I don't know if he thought one season zero Wario was muscular and lean he was not fat he can be strong and remember da woman and he has complete control shop woman if he'd says Dunkleman and remember he has a sister sword indicating he used to be a swordsman if he um if he hasn't stopped man at you or he sends himself at you and he just switches them in an instant without a flaw and just flashes off your shadow and able to do things like that so that would be kind of thing because the same with Moria is he does not have to touch Kaido to kill him all he meets do it /title shadow he's got to spider shadow Kaito is dead no matter how invisibly dig yeah but that would never happen because gear for floofy is definitely faster than Moria even prime oh yeah I would I would say I really don't see Moria being Espino and there's no way that if luffy gets be blessed by Taito the more is miss cheevus what kind of I agree if his ability got off but you would need a lot of help and preparation and you need a way to slow Kaito down in order to make that a reality and I don't think anyone on I don't think anyone on Moyers crew or nor you could ever get to that point Appleman is instantaneous teleportations at one point I'm kind of that's what a speed bluesy is like like Kylie even if he switches it Moria isn't fast enough he might be the only saw this year old depressed on his but never trained and a blue moon Laurie I'm pleased that was I believe he was always lazy I think that's the motif of his character like he would have been better in the new world like he probably wouldn't even got beat in the new world if he was more motivated to go and do stuff like from the beat oh I don't think he was ever a motivated guy no he was deaf if you saw him at maybe watch episode zero I watched episode zero and yet he looked better and III really I really believe that he was stronger back then but everyone has a cap and I think Moria had a cap like he he definitely was our if we would just put him on a commander level I wouldn't give him first I'm sorry I would give him second at most third not even third after we see him when he gets depressed because his abilities are good but I'm telling you if we could find a way around it post time post depression Moria is is we couldn't post then three times get Luffy he he was awake after Luke and punched him like like Luffy did the nightmare Luffy and he punched him but more you were still awake after that so he's not a scrub he won't get taken out but he's not like as strong as you're putting him I would definitely say people underestimate him I think you're over you're giving them a little bit too much right now but you can't blame or forgetting defeated in the new world like if you cross sky though like even if you first mate level or whatever point you didn't run away like Lucifer got beat he got put in jail and he said i'ma try again but more you're right hold on I'm but no this is different cuz Moria got to be late but imagine if we didn't get speared imagine if every single straw-hat mommy's girl Brooke chocolate you stop robbing all of them all get slaughtered right in front of Lucy I'm not even serious even he would be motivated to just oh I'm just gonna get new nah c'mon start all over again I mean that kind of happened to him because remember he got um he didn't know what what happened to them he just saw them disappear so you could say Luffy thought all the straw has to bed and he trained and then someone told him they were better afterwards but there was a period with Lucy was depressed and he was saying he thought they were gone but he's still training so it's like you can't give Moria treats that his character doesn't have like he his case his character is to give up and and and that blocks him from unlocking all the potential that you're talking about like if you were to totally switch his character he'll be a whole new person he wouldn't be Moria so mauryas character is to be where he's at I don't think he'll be able to get stronger even at his peak he's second commander love who because of his mentality my he would have had conquer his hockey or did something and in blue because his will that's what makes you a king that's what makes Lucy special Luffy could be weak his fruits we're he's not that tall he's not that big but he just kept getting put into crazy situations and ouch and just strength through it all that's not Moria the difference between like a first commander and like regular pirates like more than a point but even going back you suck would you say I would I don't think this but would you say peace at Kosaku drop is about as strong as thriller darkman oh yeah I don't think they'd let Villa bark Moria a lot of things that went into maurya's character free time skip was definitely his utility I don't think who's up is at that level because he was bringing dead back to life and all that and that's like next-level stuff but who's up definitely had a huge like breakout year when it came to that stuff cuz I'm heat like you say have to join wolf so his area of effect is like on a crazy level compared to his little fire birds and a little pachinko balls from before but he doesn't have the area he doesn't have the area fake hockey is too much of a thing like people have said so many times if you don't have hockey in a new world your screw loose table is one of those rare people that's like squeezing by him Brook Frankie all them I don't think they have either loose op is the one that shows the most promise but if he doesn't get armament or at least get his officers to a point where it's like crazy then he's he's putting this self at risk especially when the crew gets do you know does her separation thing and they get separated and they have to fight on our own that's gonna be a big sticking point for him if he doesn't learn one of the hot keys to a point where he can defend himself cuz I feel like observation is for dodging and armament is of course for blocking and those are the two things you have to do Luffy fog auto curry when he couldn't block he dodged and if he didn't have that he would have been dead and Kyla curry wouldn't have had that respect for him to let him live you know and how well however have you perceived that fight if floofy didn't have the ability to use crazy observation and create night and okay armament he would have died and who Saab doesn't have any of that so this is another level you know so who would you put would you put when you compare it was any y'all go cool in new world just any crew or anybody I can think of you're gonna marine like anyone you think I would say this would be alright so you know how loose up and Lucy had that fight I think he I think that was basically I think that would be recreated again in new world if if who said worse to fight Kobe because Kobe doesn't have crazy observation haki he doesn't have crazy armament but it's enough to make him a threat but that's all he has but a new Saab has so much utility that he'll be able to counteract this so it'll be around that level like somebody that doesn't have too much strength because I don't think Kobe would would knock out loose often one hit and I think you sob could be the opposite sad day I felt like you about to say this but I really hope we win it because this one's I think conversation I think you're extremely under estimating Kobe did you see my how strong this Kobe's video you're you're assuming that I put Kobe low I just said that he'll be able to fight Kobe and I think that's a compliment - sup because he doesn't even have hockey so I'm putting that that's like a praise like Oh be strong he's gonna get stronger because he's had one of the fastest grows in one piece wanna hear something that could knock your dog well you see we are gonna think why do some what's something that's gonna make you scream and go 90 like and I read it I think Kobe hit Sanya give me or don't blink though bro you know like I'm saying that people are enjoy their opinions with sometimes is there there's just wrongness I'm sorry doesn't make any sense no it doesn't there's no I think if we only saw a Covey's observation on it was pretty strong we know the weekend event just remember he would Kobe was just able to sense the one princess on the one ship that they didn't even really know where it was Jessica tossed me so then how Michael was like how strong is your observation on me well here's the thing Kobe's I know some people want to say things like goofy Stephanie like the rock and Kobe is gonna be the same if your next Pirate King but even if toby is like this is like supporting rock that like GARP still beat the Rock will not spring carpet because we're stronger than Luffy but I'm saying Kobe Kobe is gonna be that you can just hear me out on this Kobe is gonna be the marine that it's gonna be biggest pain and I feel like Kobe is gonna have that's what I believe I'm not smoker I think it's gonna be Probie and I feel like Kobe thought just as much motivation as we see like Kobe's motivation to become an admiral except us we used to become the Pirate King so Kobe's gonna have to be keeping like I know and marineford he got wreck but then you see I like Kobe is a pretty big genius like when he awakened that observation it was really really strong so I feel like Kobe's gonna have to be keeping pace but like not keeping pace but like of course to be stronger than go swimming or gym a I feel like he Kobe's gonna always be a little ways behind you if he ever hopes to be an admiral that's going to be fighting Lucy's and the new world when you choose the Pirate King a boy or the Orion Co he's gonna have to be fairly close to me and I don't I don't see how Kobe's gonna only be strong its own like Peeta and even hope to eventually that's absolutely my coach and his copy has as much motivation as Lucy I feel like he came a long ways I agree what you said when you talk about Kobe and his growth but I don't believe he's strong as doflamingo those feats are more likely well I mean you could him you said both of them so I was just going off what you said but I mean if you want sake do something out I'm proud of you so we can just go off jimbe now Jim Bay would arguably be able to if one of the straw hats go down take the place of the monster trio easily so Sanji goes out Jim Bay would be a good replacement meaning he's there around the same strength place I believe Zorro and Sons you will be able to beat will be able to beat him what would be able to beat Jim Bay just kind of I feel like like basically he's the four strongest in the crew I believe Bruce top is the fifth to sixth strongest in the crew and only the only luffy is beating doflamingo in stride so I just want to get that out there I know I mean you were entitled to think that and I could see how I could see why like maybe you could put Zorro in there maybe even Sanji but I really did like that Dhokla Mingo just has too much tech for me a lot of people are kind of like looking at it stressed overall but I don't know fee went all out against you know luffy and gear for barely did the job but i put them on no one has enough strengthen let's try head crew to arrival maximum effort Luffy going full snake man cuz snake man you know it's faster than anyone else on the crew by leaps and bounds and I don't think you know Kobe could match that now I like I said I think he's all new sobs level and and and Kobe isn't I don't think Kobe could be doflamingo there's just no way he doesn't have like it took Lucy Kings hockey observation haki armament haki all in the next level because yet because he had Kings hockey and the devil fruit that's damn near awakened Musab doesn't have any of that Kobe doesn't have any of it I put some rocks I didn't mean not you underestimate the flamingos but not even the shore hat but like guys like they just other guys like I feel like you don't under this is the thing I know this like lots of people underestimate other people like they don't underestimate go flamingo but they don't realize that there are a lot of people that are on the mingoes level it's just none of the people you names like you said Kobe's on his level of course you took that bag and you you're saying Musab could beat some crazy people and djembe it's just I think your power scaling a lot of these people in a weird way and you're not like looking at like their overall usefulness and cuz cuz matchups mean a lot so even if Luffy even if Luffy be too narrow we all know why he beats now so it's not like he's on that level doflamingo doflamingo beat Luffy soundly because of his skill set in his base form but other people's base for him maybe do better against him like fujitora would do way better against uh against doflamingo his base form without awakening or doing his stuff Lucy did because of his gravity for like he doesn't fight with pure strength and like luffy didn't have enough strength and gear seconds I heard him and he was too slow in gear third but that doesn't apply to like fujitora or I'm not saying bottom is stronger but bartimeo because he has different like all if doflamingo didn't raise law no law like law would probably like locking one shot a lot of people who don't see him coming like he cuts him in half so it's all about matchups and I feel like Musab has a lot of tech if he just got at least a basic understanding of of combat observation in combat hockey he would be a nasty dude because he has a lot of different crazy abilities that he can use but Kobe all he has is his fists just like Luffy so he has a a narrower scope of people he could fight Luffy over Bob strength and dirt and durability Kobe doesn't have the durability of Luffy because he doesn't have the fruit and luffy's a monster got birth kobe doesn't have a special bloodline and plat armor to give him all that durability so that's why i'm separating him so much from people like luffy and doflamingo because we've seen monster level endurance and all that from them we haven't seen that from Kobe he got one shot by Luffy no one of note is getting one shot by Luffy like no one so that was three times skip but he could not have grown more than Luffy his girl like in order for him not to give him one shot by Luffy he would have to be on at least Sauron songzies level and I don't believe he is I believe he's on theodora's level in terms of durability overall overall cuz overall he can't cause damage like Zorro and he's not as fast as on day so you're not lag about speed well anyway Ghandi family's like well if I could Gail Kobe but like they stuff would he see and what he has unless he has a devil fruit or some common I'm not saying he has to but it is what I'm saying is in order to have the ability to face opponents to say he's strong like Zorro and Suns you can face a wide variety of enemies because of the overall strength like their strengths can cut through a lot of things like Zorro can cut through people with arm in hockey he can touch people with devil fruits he could do all this different create darkness uh sure but all Kobe has moving kinda fast and punching people so we look at Arsenal is not good enough to fight people like Paige would like these Arsenal fast and punching people and even look at Garf Garf Arsenal isn't right that's it remember what I said his hit they overwhelm people with their strength if your arm in hockey isn't comparable to my base punch like like Garth I mean Lucy punch Don chin Giles a little his head thing which means that he has strength somewhere on pre like prime good not prime guard but like young guard what he punched down chin Giles thing Luffy did the same thing and guard was able to punch a continent that's probably at full strength but at least Luffy had the strength to straight down chin Giles head and that's a big feat he was over to overwhelm their hockey I don't see Kobe overwhelming anyone's like he's been training for two years like for this his whole life oh yeah but Kobe like even looking like like goofy just over two years at leave nobody faced over two years doebelin stress and you're at a 20 you're just a 40 but if you double experience if you're a hundred you're 200 there's a difference Luffy had two bases for fighting combat and surviving by any means necessary he was sitting there getting punched with spiked knuckles as a little kid like you can't put them on the same level when luffy has been training for more than way more than to you that's why you can't put gar patlu fee on the same level cuz garbage been at this for so long yeah he's not his peak anymore but Pete GARP and Pete Luffy corner you can't see people volusia right now it's a wash yeah but we haven't but Coby going to quote unquote catch up to Russia my hair alright so what I believe is gonna happen is he gonna have to expound there's gonna be a point where he fights loosing one more time or he's gonna have some got heart-to-heart with guard or some kind of some kind of thing in the river II and he's gonna get the realization just like Lucy got the realization that he needs to get not only stronger but more versatile and work on his fighting technique so he's either gonna incorporate a weapon get get some of those six powers maybe you'll get a fruit but he asked he got more than what he has now he'll have to like he doubled his shrimp before he's gonna have the double in strength again that that's what I think his journey is like once he get like the same height as Luffy and he you know I'm saying get get he gets a real position and his disposition changes that's when I think he is so so maybe like a hundred or so fifty more chapter or something like that okay so back this up you put them on Kobe's level yeah well like this good no yeah yeah that's pretty good for how strong a syncope is where would I put probably I I feel like even going by of course must be few hundred million I can set I don't know there's not a lot of people I feel like these strength is completely known like Kobe mostly his strength in speculation but for someone who drinks is known I feel like probably at least what if the straw hat grand fleet captain like one of those guys like maybe I do get excited about that I think you would be I don't know who's consider strongest maybe hi Rudy nor Cavendish when he goes Hakuba tap evidence with Hakuba pink song do you think he's weaker than that you think Kobe's weaker than Hakuba Cavendish now so you think Kobe is the strongest one in the grand fleet if he joins yeah okay so you think so he would have to be faster than you know oh boy now we're not necessarily but he would have to make up for it in some way and when it comes to fighting all he has his speed and ability to punch hard so if he's not out speeding Cavendish I don't know how he's stronger than him you know yeah I think he's up Sweden Cavendish to be on this right that's a that's a bold claim and I like it I would have to I can't buy any oh okay I was weird um but yeah Oh Cavendish like I was saying that's kind of a lofty well well it appears as the founders just got help I don't know what can be about it so I guess you're just gonna end up ending the stream here it's been a good stream we share the subscribe to vote your values Channel and be honest I think I was kind of on the losing side in this stream there may be a part two but thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video", "stEq6s5hefY": "Thank You senator Baldwin senator wicker Thank You mr. chairman this hearings been going on an hour and a half now I mean maybe it's maybe it's time to sort of summarize what we've learned so far I'll start with you miss Baker we are behind in 5g are we in second place or third place and how far behind are we and and how big of a problem is that I don't think senator Schatz has elicited an answer yet about our spectrum now Act which he and I have introduced with you to all and Moran so maybe some of you have an opinion about whether that's a valuable thing for Congress to do what else is the role of Congress in getting us where we need to be on mid-band and what's the role of the FCC specifically do they need to act more quickly in in addressing the mid band spectrum such as the preceding own the c-band so we'll start down here and and see if we can bring this hearing up to date thank you for your question as a big one I would say we are behind we announced that we were number three in the global race behind China and South Korea we were number one in industry readiness we were number six in mid bands that averaged out to number three since we announced that this committee in its leadership as well as the FCC has stepped up so we are making progress we have a plan we now have a plan on spectrum which is airwaves and we have a plan on siding new the new the new small cells with streamlined so we we we as in this committee and the FCC and and the country as a whole to win the race to 5g we can still win but we have to act and so I think it's very important both for our economy because of we were leaders in 4G it enabled the innovation of the app industry the innovation of the sharing economy to be here in the United States and we want the same thing for 5g we don't know exactly what 5g is going to unlock except for we know it's going to be remote surgery we know that at a hundred times faster and you know and virtually no no lag time we know it's going to unlock all kinds of things in transportation and energy and education we want all of that to happen here so that we can export our innovation instead of taking the Chinese innovation here yes yes senator wicker thank you so much for that question I want to clarify two important points first when Miss Baker says the United States is behind no one no one is the head of Qualcomm and making the chips for five she okay that is and that work is being done in the United States of America just this week we announced something that no one in the wireless industry thought was possible when 5g was first conceived no one thought it was going to go into a phone because for these millimeter wave bands you have many many antennas and the ability to have many antennas you know there's no place in one of these phones to put more antennas what we announced this week is a module that's half the size of a paper clip that has supports four to eight antenna elements and will be three of these going in the first five chief smartphones so in terms of the technology we're ahead qual comes ahead and we're or America well let me just interject though with regard track spectrum now Act which we still don't have any testimony on its intended to make spectrum available by providing support for users to research new and innovative ways to increase spectrum efficiency is this a bill any of you have looked at my goodness absolutely okay I apologize it was a big question I didn't get all of it right we support it and then the other thing I wanted to clarify on mid-band is there is something the effort the FCC just announced this 3.72 four to notice of proposed rulemaking thick document asking a lot of questions that just happened but what they so they're going to have to wait for the private sector used to make their comments and they're gonna have a series of issues that they have to grapple with but what the FCC could do and both mr. cotton and I have alluded to it for more mid-band spectrum today is the FCC's had this proceeding going on about the rules for the CB RS ban which is three point five to three point seven gigahertz that's a hundred and fifty megahertz which could be used for 5g but there's an FCC proceeding that they haven't finished up it would be fantastic and it would help us on the scorecard that Miss Baker keeps if we could finish that if the FCC could finish that proceeding quickly in ten seconds you know real quickly I would say while there are some issues in terms of Technology leadership and ranking us in the world with 5g development one of the critical issues with 5g regardless that many infrastructure providers are already doing anyway is building out expansive wireline connectivity because when you go to 5g you're going from these macro towers to small cells those small cells need wireline connectivity and so we're not stopping or waiting to build out that wireline infrastructure and that really is the long pole in the tent so to speak and so I want to be clear while there are some technology issues to deal with infrastructure providers are building out the wireline capacity to enable 5g when that equipment becomes available thank you Thank You senator wicker Senator mark", "fe4s8trJEbM": "so before I start this video I just want to say yes it's been a while since my last return video and I know it's been just about another month and a half since I've made a video things are a little busy right now I will go into that in later detail second of all if you hear background noise just accept it I'm filming outside I have great lighting today and it's way too beautiful to be filming in the studio lots of people yelling outside it's just the thing that's going to be happening in the future from time to time get used to it [Music] if there's one thing besides electricity that most of us take for granted it would be wireless connections for our mobile devices specifically cellular connections it's one the easiest things in the world to forget about because it's around us all the time and it seems like every couple of years or so we start seeing more and more about the improvements on this technology back in 2008 it was all about three gene then we moved on to 4G and then on top of 4G we got LTE well now the latest buzz for the last year has been 5g but what is it what will it do and when can you expect to start using it before the next big Wireless change happens all of this information can be a bit overwhelming so it's time for an explanation a simplified explanation 5g is on the most basic level imaginable just the next generation of cellular wireless it's something that everyone has seen coming for ever even a Best Buy commercial from the Superbowl back in 2011 saw this coming and you know we're in a weird place when ozzy osbourne is making technology predictions from the viewpoint of someone who uses a cell phone which you might be 5g will allow faster data speeds and will grant you faster downloads of webpages apps and your favorite movies and TV shows how much faster will this network go you may ask compared to the 4G LTE standard which is the best you can get without going to Wi-Fi 5g is promising theoretical top download speeds of up to 20 gigabits per second up to 50 times faster than the current standard can provide next time you're at home try testing your cable internet and seeing if you can approach speeds like that even Google Fiber which was promising speeds that hardly any other ISP could even compete with was only topping out at around one gigabit per second with speeds like that you will be able to not only download some serious 4k and possibly soon 8k right to your phone or laptop but you will also be able to handle things like VR and AR while on the go however you have to understand that these kinds of speeds are based on a variety of factors and will hardly if ever reach the maximum data speed but even if you were only to get 1/10 or even 1/100 of that theoretical speed that would still be able to put your home Internet to shame and for people like me who will be living in the city and won't be able to get cable companies to dig up a line to their studio apartment cellular companies will now be able to compete with traditional ISPs well sort of compete AT&T and Time Warner I'm looking at you the second part of what 5g brings to the wireless table is the ability to handle a greater number of devices at once or the throughput this is an important feature considering the world we are going to be living in from this moment on not only because tens of thousands of people at concerts and baseball games are streaming to Instagram snapchat Facebook and YouTube all at the same time but it's also because soon every device in your home including your toaster will have a wireless connection before back in the days of 3G and early 4G the only wireless device you had on you was your phone and maybe a cellular capable laptop or netbook now we have smart watches fitness trackers iPads drones and soon even our cars which brings me to the last feature that 5g brings along and that is a far lower latency latency is how fast data actually gets to your device it's like when you're video chatting someone in the next room and you notice that there is a slight delay in the video on your screen and when they are actually saying something it gets annoying in a situation like that but it can be a matter of life and death when someone is in a self-driving car and a self-driving car has to make decisions on data it receives over cellular connections and for those of you who thought I would make a video like this and not talk about self-driving cars you were wrong to me self-driving cars are probably the biggest thing to benefit from the promises of 5g wireless because relying on sensors isn't enough to ensure the safety of self-driving cars when you have millions of cars on the road talking to each other over wireless and sharing data gigabit speeds with almost no delay 5g is a technology that can make that happen and bring forward a future of wireless products that wouldn't even be possible today so when can we expect this and is the phone you're looking at the holidays going to have it unfortunately it's going to be a while before we get to see the full glory of 5g infrastructure the plan as of this point is to have the system begin rolling out to the masses by 2020 but even that is a stretch considering there are going to be a lot of requirements this network needs to meet before it gets to the point that 4G is at today 18 T is still rolling out 5g and a select number of test cities and even still there phones aren't widely available on the market today that can take advantage of these networks it's basically the opposite of when there were a ton of 4k TVs on the market but hardly anyone was producing 4k content soon enough one half of the technology will catch up with the other but until then we are stuck listening to how the future is only a few short years away I just hope in that an amount of time we don't see the beginnings of the next generation of wireless it's beaver 6g fever [Music] you", "B3AP7M_FNWo": "anime fans one piece fans what is good the answer that question of course is one piece one pieces what's good and today we got this one piece chapter 963 fire well I don't know if it's fire I didn't really hear any rumors on discord and what not I don't know if this chapter is supposed to be good if it's supposed to be mid like I don't know but you know we just out here chillin so let's get into this one piece chapter 963 Wow so it's just but I can't believe 963 chapters at around this time next year I it's it's going to be 1000 chapters and that's just kinda surreal to me so yeah let's just get into the self we got the cover page of course beige on my family but germs pirate crew attacked the country while the king was away so I think they're still in dress rosa and these Germans pirates the captain just looks unhealthy he really does so their journey started on the back of an elephant long long ago centuries back we minx made a solemn vow with the Kisuke clan samurai voix know we are family so I think this does mean that the guys that washed up on the shore last chapter were members of the Kisuke not Kisuke they were minks like I'm pretty sure they were Inu and Necco like people didn't that wasn't confirmed but it just looked to me like they were Inu and that goes so you know I'm just gonna go with that so we are family we promised that we would always assist one another one faced with hardships okay yes definitely inner actually nekima mushi you can just see by their backs like the ears like it's obviously them and they were obviously the ones who washed up on the shore so yeah those were definitely them so we don't know when that time will come but we so then they're just like one no huh I'd love to see the outside world yeah I can real same yeah it's like a cat like yeah it's hard to say so like hey where can we find this land I heard there was a bunch of different ones that's right there are more than five islands in the world there are that many I'm hungry yeah so you can just see you know neckla they kind of wanted to go on an adventure I guess so as kids they wanted to go find one oh and they sell there and then they're pretty sheltered so they're surprised that there's more than five islands in the world so then something happened I can't see all right they got destroyed by a wave their boat got wrecked by the ocean and then Knuckles like the world is horrible 100 is horrible because we know that one oh it's pretty protected by the weather definitely so then wait a minute oh oh I see so that's not they got washed up on wha Oh No and now we see that they're tied to a stake and are apparently about to get lynched by townspeople from ah no because you see that there is neck oh and you knew and then there's also called Matsu because in the last chapter I believe we saw Carl Matsu over them mm-hmm so it's just like three strange creatures and then the people of wanna of course hate them kind of like fishermen all over again but now that goes like we shouldn't have come here he was like doggone we should never have gone out to see our family Yeah right a cat monster a dog monster in the coppa is this Beach cursed burn them at the stake and then there we hear they're just all upsetting they're like aah and then Odin is in the ocean and he's like phew now I have enough ingredients to make tonight's Odin huh and then he sees the column Otsu in our Rashi nekima mushi crying and then he sees the townspeople laughing or just the samurais in general and Odin is like you should be ashamed to be afraid of those who look different only high night highlights your ignorance how dare you bully a bunch of kids disgraceful and he just beat them all up and then Odin is like now then farewell and then they're like you're leaving us like this he just left him tied up and then this is that curry curry castle what why did you bring these monsters here sir Odin they followed me thank you for helping us back there so it's like coming tribe in Araji main tribe nekima mushi like you already knew that but you know one piece always got to do that that introductions you know what I'm saying so they're like Huff yeah we were already starving but then we were almost beaten to death this is so hard there's no I can eat it this is hard to believe they really are talking animals that's Kinnaman and then oh and it's like the Ming tribe my father mentioned it to me yeah I bet he did an instruction in our country mentions our bond to your family and now you're our Savior as well still I may be hungry but this is way too our and then he's just like oh he just tosses it and then in a rush it's like stop that nekima mushi and then he's like I have cat's tongue wah ha ha hey cat Odin would not be Odin if it's not boiled and eaten hot and then Karl Marx is like this is yummy and what are you meant to be my mother and I drifted to this country after our ship sank when we asked for help people threw stones at us because we were fishermen my mother was injured so we were unable to return home ok so Karl Marx who is a fish man that's kind of surprising because when he was introduced like people are like is he a fisherman but it was kind of insinuated he was something different in not a fisherman but apparently Korematsu is indeed a fisherman so I was kind of wondering if it was gonna be a honing race but you know Fishman is cool like you know we love fishermen out here we really do so he's like with her dying breath my mother told me fishermen are always discriminated against in this world he would be more likely to survive if he claimed to be a Kappa so now I'm calling matzah takapa live off of leftovers others throw away oh I see so he was a fisherman and then he was his mom told him to claim to be a copper because he knows she knows that the people of Juana are superstitious and would be more likely to I guess accept him you know what I'm saying so I am so grateful not only did you save me but you fed me delicious food too I will never forget what you did for me today and then neck and when we she's like oh I forgot my manners I wished all that food you know uh she's like now you're acting like an adult and he's like I'm sorry Kappa I'll help you finish it and he's like it's still hot and then Odin is like ha ha what an interesting cat and then uh you know Rosh is like a cat and then Odin it's like meeting you guys has made me realize that there are many creatures them this world I have yet to see now I am really excited for my next voyage take care and then he's like take care and then all of them jump on him and they're like no let us stay here you didn't even ask us they're just dogpiling him and then they're like this group keeps getting bigger well considering their strength it should be fine but we are running low on funds you let more money to that fellow Orochi right why do you keep doing that oh well even though he is on his own now he used to work for Yasui so I cannot just leave him to die huh so I that's right because I wrote she stole the money I guess he got booted but you know I don't know I wrote cheese justice he's kind of a snake you know well we already knew that but I don't know gifting money to her wrote she's a bad idea out and just a bad idea so tiptoe slow and steady this is the essence of walking like a ninja we can do this jazz tui is no big deal so you got Kinnaman Rizzo and kanjar-ro doing something Haku my why were you trying to steal so much money because they're old and needed money if you are going to execute us then get it over with already you Hedgehog that dang old and he sure recruited some odd characters I will give you the money you tried to steal they're like huh so all the nine scabbards right because he was giving money to Orochi they all try to his steal money from Yasui and then they're like what wait Lord yeah sweet if you did that how come my home run out of and on top of that and then the gas was like in on top of that take this - he's a wisely even more are you being serious is something wrong with you is this some sort of trap and then Yost was like do you love Odin and then he's like if you do then use this money to dress properly and then they're like ah this these do not suit us at all so they're just all in classy clothes now and then hmm and then I can't tell you what that is I think that's Kiku he's like Setia and kind of months like learned something in manners wrong it has to come from the gut like this Sasha so Sarah is a term that samurais used to address themselves according to the description in the box below buy some books and bow yourself with knowledge and wisdom so this is just yes we over voicing them he's told them to learn manners by books and he's like if hoodlums like you were able to become the retainers of Odin as you are right now you would bring shame to his name and then took like Lord Odin dbiddy good morning this deep-fried tofu was simply exquisite and then Odin's like why are you lot suddenly acting so strangely it's so creepy and then Yahoo is like he will one day be the Shogun Juan oh and the people who will support him through it all must be the best samurai in the entire country so you can see them training a servant's duty is to protect their master all of you must make yourselves the Capitol's no the entire country's guardians and they're just training like crazy so it says three years later thirty years from the present the flower capital I heard that the daimyo of curry and his followers will be visiting the capital wah ha ha be sure to hide your money to avoid getting robbed Lord Odin and his retainers are thugs after all wait there's mr. mountain mountain Junior get in the crate oink-oink so I think this is a young Mountain God or something look the party from curry has arrived oh my what are they his samurai we're Odin's retainers always so dignified and they're just kind of confused they're like my eyes must be deceiving me it almost looks like the Cho Shogun's profession so I'm like now that I've seen General Order I am basically certain that dentro is Koshiro like I don't see how he wouldn't be kosher oh he's like God to be cultural you know what I'm saying he just looks like kosher Oh then you got YZ o and YZ o has a sword so I guess he was a swordsman I wonder why he would switch the guns then the majestic and dignified appearance of the same are I their commanding presence could take your breath away the onlookers were in such awe that many had even dropped down to their knees if I have become a fine man it is thanks to you but I am Not sure I have changed one bit I cannot believe you are thanking me why do you look so outraged so Odin is talking to his father I believe I can't quite see who that is but I think he's talking to his dad and then Odin came to visit after hearing his father taken ill but after seeing his father's energy his worries disappeared however that was the last time the two would ever speak so you see a roadie there I'm figuring that Orochi was probably one of the king's attendant he probably found a poison him that same year poor Itachi okay you know I had to say this it's called poor Itachi so you know I had to say this rest in peace Itachi okay let's switch back to the only whoa else didn't say let's switch back to the right anime but I just finished saw white beard up in the air oh let's get on with this chapter we find the waterfall didn't we so why is there a sea in an island up here I can sense that there's other humans nearby pops it'll take a fit week to finish the repairs the cargo hold is flooded so our provisions aren't good as gone we need to head out to find supplies any volunteers basically everyone we're tired of sitting around I'll go - yo I know you're just an apprentice oh so we see young white beard and Markos like I'll go too and he's like you're just an apprentice so Marco has gone from being an apprentice to the right-hand man a white beard in just 30 years that's impressive so we see Vee stuff we see Jo soo Jung [ __ ] ooh and we see a guy I don't recognize he's probably the former second commander so Captain tough the white papyrus Edward Newgate Lord Odin went to the coast why did he let him go we must stop him I heard that a pirate ship was spotted at port Itachi they apparently looked different from other pirates their ship is supposed to be huge - they must be pretty strong this is terrible he must have gone to chase them off if that's the case it might not be so bad hey all of you stand back huh white bridge said that to his guys and then he's like something's coming something incredible so this is the pirate ship congratulations on making it here you must have traversed all that terrible weather and waterfall I have been waiting for you and white birds like this doesn't look good and then Odin jumps out white beard wait yeah Jody jumps out white beard and then they clash Ivan Odin's like ha ha ha my name is Kisuke Odin I want you to let me and we may not know each other but I want me to let you I'm sorry I'm just tripping up for my words my name is Odin Kazuki we may not know each other but I want you to let me join their crew whoa so that was a good ending to the chapter good ending to the flashback because I was tripping over my world just this whole time but sorry I had a bad night of sleep last night so I don't know I'm just a bit out of the loop but so just white beard and Odin be clashing like that they're just like boom it wasn't quite a yong-chol clash you could see cuz like the skies didn't split so Odin wasn't yonkoma at least at the time or if they clashed in an epic manner that is one great drawing a great scene and then he just immediately asks him to join his crew so good chapter the chapter I didn't find it as engaging as other chapters have been but the ending with the clash with white beard that was cool and it was cool to see that Markel was an apprentice 30 years ago so my channel's namesake has went from being apprentice to right hand and strongest member in the wipe your pirates and just 30 years now this guy with the giant chain of mace I'm not sure if we've seen him before if we have it he might be the second the former second commander that disappeared but you know that stuff will be cleared up in the next chapter so yeah thanks for watching if in from our content and only fiend drama constant like this video subscribe and turn on notifications for more one piece content I can't wait for the next chapter can't wait to see how this ode and flashback progresses and I will see you in the next video", "IU0SK7aIEdg": "anime fans want these fans let's good answer that question of course is one piece one pieces was good and we got another life chapter VIII action again sorry from the newest got it just the bike but this is the last chapter of the stinking decade okay it's a turn of a decade another turn of a decade from one piece so is pretty monumental and like last chapter had a lot of setup like we got Roger in the Odin and all of that stuff so you know it's something you probably want to look forward to you know no you know what I'm saying so we're just gonna hop right into this one this chapter is called Roger and white bridge that's what it's called okay so you know I'm kind of excited for this one because I was like this seems like this is gonna be fairly uh he seems like it's gonna be a fairly big chapter you know what I mean like we might see some fighting between white beard and Roger some fighting between their cruise or something like that oh and let's just get into the shops here I've been talking too long so of course a couple of pages page on my family so chip on is caught by pirates while she was getting a haircut because they're wanted I guess so now let's get into the actual thing so here he comes the samurai and then Rogers like the one we heard about so it's kind of oh and in Odin's apparently charging at him so they're like here he comes the same are I and then why fear pirates are like wait commander Odin and oh and it's like all I have to do is take their treasure right dealing with them won't be easy the Roger pirates aren't at different levels than the enemies look place before the door you Odin God Meraki I couldn't it was hard for me to say it at first but Odin's just slicing through their ranks like nothing so that's a pretty cool move by him pretty cool so the Roger pies are like the rumors for true he's incredibly strong should we cut them wait oh that's that's that's Caban Gabbana's like should we cut him to pieces railay and railings like fine by me wait Gibran railay I wouldn't want my best two men to get hurt oh so that kind of confirms is like the scopic Aban thing like that he actually is the best like he's the UH the Roger pirates has to offer Baha besides really like I know some people are arguing that scarpered Caban could not be the strongest you know what I mean some people were arguing that like he could not be this on YouTube that kind of confirms it he's like Hassan ji of the crew let me respond to the chat real quick and then we'll just get into the chapter fully you know what I mean so anyway you got Odin just charging towards the rock pirates and that's kinda high that's pretty high plate ona versus Roger pirates and then Rogers like I wouldn't want my two best men to get hurt and then Fraley it's like you just want to face him yourself and Odin's like the are of a wild beast and Rogers like a samurai and then owners like wait is that a Roger coming sorry is that the first named Roger attack was seen brah I think that's the first named Roger attack we've seen come ooh sorry and the translation is a version to Definity so that makes 19 a Roger contents cards and all that he just slammed onand dang and it is like blood coming out of his mouth and he's like huh and he just went flying boom and Odin's like what the heck was that incredible Roger just oh wow Roger Roger went through boom on Odin he just like with his bare fists oh wait was that his breakfast I can't tell oh wait no it wasn't his bare fists it was a sword slash oh that was a sort well that was a sword slash and Odin half-block did I believe it was kinda hard to tell but Odin goes flying and slams into a tree and he's like what was that that was incredible and then suddenly white beard jumps out of nowhere with his giant weapon I feel bad I forget what white British weapon is called and that makes me less of a fan so let me just search what white mace weapon is called up real quick okay so bring his percent oh so basically why produces % oh and he goes that rod we get to see a white beard and Roger Clash how amazing is that how amazing is that a white beard and Roger Clash that's something I didn't expect to see for a while I don't even know what to say it's just so crazy a white beard and Roger white beard and Roger have clashed and we seen it that's insane so you could just got the boom like they just clashed and it's crazy in the mics Wow and again I'm sorry I thought that my mic stand broke so it's gonna be acting up a little bit so they aren't even touching they're not touching and you just got all these like crazy this outburst of energy when they're not even touching and I and it's noteworthy that Roger also has a pole arm which is weird oh wait no he doesn't sorry this drawing is kind of confusing probably because of the redrawing so he does it looks like he had a pole on for a second but he doesn't so you got white beard Roger just staring each other down and there's just this whole like clash of conker Zaki so it's pretty crazy and then the wife your pirates are like our ship and white Brits like you look good and Rogers like how many years hasn't been Newgate and they both say give me everything you have and then wipe it's the signature laughs or or or I'm Roger does ha ha ha and then the wipe your powers are like come on then and the right parts are like loop them so we see a lot of Roger pirates we still don't really know their names so the Roger pirates versus to wipe your pirates the battle between these two great pirate crews lasted three days and three nights with the upper hand constantly shifting from once from side to side I knew they were gonna ask me now I hope they would an off-screen it but I kind of knew they were gonna ask mean it because like oh and it's not that nice Odin couldn't just let us get a battle between the ROG of the wipe your pirates like the whole thing we saw a clash between white beard and Roger how rare is that how rare is that it's the same it's just the same clash between white beard and Roger dang that that's the same so the battle they're both so powerful to battle and lasted three days and three nights three days and three nights like we going all shown up in here you feel me but it's like that's how powerful they are that they're able to fight for three days and three nights without one side winning and the fact that they have that much stamina to be able to do though like you know we dang so the battle lasts three days and three nights four days later wooden outrageous shirt where did you get it wait a minute you're drinking too much we agreed everyone would have to same amount the southern sake is too good I'll give you three crates for it this has to become a gift exchange that's what Bailey says suddenly they're intermingling apparently and they're partying together that's crazy like they fight for three days and three nights and now they're just not allies but now they're like partying together like you know but that just shows you the familial side of white beer and the adventurous I Roger mixing together like after the burnt themselves out of the battle like they're willing to set their differences aside and just party like that's some classic one piece right there that's some classic one piece and you see jozu and the big guy from the roger pirates just clicking l mugs and all that it's pretty cool and then we see Blackbeard he's like those boys I guess he's not Blackbeard yet he's teach we see teach be like are those boys over there are predators apprentices and the droves is like yeah they've been in there for a while they don't look very strong their attitude is quite impressive so resi shakes and buggy like it's kind of funny cuz like buggy he's kind of trash but even so he's just like this was shanks Jenks is like and Budd you just like doing the same thing he's like like buggies just trying to look all cool and stuff that's just kind of funny like buggy looks so much more epic now and cooler now than he does like in the guard dog why not gonna lie even though I'm not trying to disrespect the great but you saw me you feel me hey shanks do you see that guy with the hat yeah he didn't sleep during the truce we had for the last few days no sorry he great he didn't sleep during the truce we had to the last few days huh why I think that's a translation our error I think he means uh well I guess what makes us I don't know because that's a little bit of a translation error but I guess I'll just take it at face value I heard he's never slept in his life ha how is that even possible I'm jealous it's just crazy they just look so funny it looked like so young and cool it just crazy just seemed shanks this young he's like huh I'm jealous [ __ ] he's like you would have twice as much time to enjoy your life if you didn't need to sleep it's not that simple idiot he's a monster can you read it yes I can I can translate it for you but why did he transcribe this these symbols are a secret code the way to decode them was passed from generation to generation to the firstborn Kazuki Kazuki clan from wardo we took the 13 years ago we were able to do what nobody else had done he reached the end of the log pose Island Road star earth reached the end of the log post island grows darker so the final island in the Grand Line is called growth star hmm so like there were theories that the last island was Elba but apparently it's an island called Road star and if you're wondering why I'm like not going psycho because we found the name of the island is because no joke I I spent the last six hours doing some programming homework and all that so I'm kinda just chill right now you feel me I'm pretty chill right now it's like dang but the last island is cold rude star okay like yeah that's pretty cool like we get we know the name of the final island Rogers like we we reached the end of the law Poe's the island of lodestar but when we got there I realized it wasn't the last island a long post couldn't guide us further because the needles kept spinning but I'm sure there's one last Island and island do you need to reach in order to travel the world a feat never done before it has these inscriptions marked on four special red stones I believe they're clues to find that Island but the world government ban deciphering the pilot lifts long ago I used to think they were ordinary objects so I was surprised when they discovered that they were essential reference points for achieving our goal so apparently the stuff apparently the stuff the stuff we know about the partner glyphs apparently that wasn't common knowledge but for Rogers uh demise and I guess that makes a lot of sense it was probably kind of the trailblazer before the world government I kept this under wraps so like yeah this is this this is this is pretty high this is pretty high so he said so he says um that means to well confirm it doesn't want anyone to reach the final island their actions only confirmed the legend that there's a huge hidden treasure there if we can get there surely will be the biggest pirate crew in the whole world the biggest that's right if then I'll be and Odin to my bigger like what and then he's like cual rah rah what a load of crap Roger he will get by any chance Odin was like I was so stunned I couldn't move it already left me speechless twice who is this guy anyway please let me borrow Odin for one year new gate this is my last request with him by my side I know I can get to the final island hey what why are you deciding to Spri yourself that's Odin what's happening Captain Rogers bound to white beard stop it captain there are rivals I beg you Odin please sailing with us for one year and Odin's like stop this this is shameful you should bow to me and white beards like quit screwing around Roger you really think I'd let you take a member of my family and they look bad then they're like oh ah the old man is trick I could give them my pumping even though I tried to hide it what do these stones have to do with the Kisuke clan what was this meeting with Roger America incidents why do you can before I could even think straight I already have my answer I'm going to go to the thought I want to get to the bottom of this please so let me go them you look disgusted and why beers like that because like we all know that wipe it disgust face like that white bear disgust face bow to become iconic like the Odin disgust face and the white bear disgust face like that bow to become iconic stuff you know anything we like that bunny face breeze like like you know that face like you made that marineford like yeah you know how that you know how that that iconic face like you know those disgust aids those discussed those disgusted faces God would be iconic you feel me like no cap her white beers like he's all like looking disgusted and he's like no kidding of course I hate the idea we're brothers aren't we but if it's only for a year no in he's like but it's only for a year why teach am please I've been nekomamushi and inuarashi and what you might call it ezel is like we'll stay here we prefer the ship so we'll wait for your return here and Odin it's like sure you have become amazing pirates so you're free to choose what you want to do and why feels like she's all like white beards all white beard trigger like he triggered he's so drinking my beers like but I but you know I feel wiper though like his little brother like he's not calling white beard nothing like he not call him white beard his son he calling him his brother like are not sorry he's not calling Odin his and he's going out and his brother like white beard thinks of Odin as his little brother not his son like everybody else so you know Odin's a valuable asset to the crew he's super strong and he's like a brother to white beard so like you yeah like like I feel that like like if I were him to like you know I I'd be like that you feel me like I wouldn't want him to go and he's all mad and then they're like parks aren't you gonna say goodbye Rogers gave us all the treasure on his ship as a thank you it's incredible there's so much and supplies to like you just see a mountain of Christian supplies in the background and wipers like give those supplies back right now idiots do you want to end his family to starve to death and they're like oh yeah yes sir and then there and then alright departure like see you soon don't forget to bring me back some souvenirs it was then that the second chapter of my life as a pirate began the beginning of a new journey whitey chin is a great man but Roger is comparable is incomparable lucky me and Rogers like it has been a while since I last had a baby so their names are mementos gained Hyori they reminded me of my childhood that's relay captain Roger we found spies there like got the rod we thought spies and the note is like in a Russian echo bush me what are you doing here and then interoceanic mumu char like we had so much fun with you Odin sama and then they're like hey the cat and the dog are gone too those idiots those are my few pirates captain needs your knowledge Oh induct you as fast as the captain did you hear that's all the Roger pirates they're just like all like oh no you you any one of us yeah you definitely ain't one of us so um yo like if I'm talking about the chat tomorrow you snitching on me bro why you snitching on me but um the Roger pirate throw bike we won't accept you here then Odin is like ah a port city do they have ingredients the port city is like pirates wait Odin don't have bands like that without thinking the captain is gonna kill you My Ride your scissors were stolen he stole my eggs huh this area lawless whatever I don't care go man I can't quite tell what's happening but like you can tell their rating and but yeah oh oh didn't got all this stuff because Roger pirates for all I go we won't accept you and then Odin does some great stuff like you oh then oh then I thought I was in his name they're all loving with him and they're like let's make a toast to our time with Odin and Odin just told them a bunch of food and stuff the crocuses like you just have one year left to live and then Odin's like what and Rogers like ha ha ha and the Rogers like that's why I'm in a hurry and then he's like I'm going to die in Odin's like yeah and they go up the knock up scream to the sky island and then they're like whoa this is crazy the world is so huge it is truly endless do you think that there are people living in the sky unbelievable they're on the sky islands I found it it's over here Wow a Bell made of gold how are we going to take it cap then so yeah oh this is cooling all the way back there like that um switch me call it that sorry I just lost my train of thought but the art the Scott the arc all the way back there when we learned that Roger had been there that's when we learned that Roger Roger had gone to the sky islands we get to see with our own eyes like what 16 years later so bruh this is insane this is insane so then they're like you can come back when your buggies like wow they'll made it forward how are we gonna take this and they're like you can come back when you're a captain bunny I have no time for this bug he's like what let's take a piece or two the stone has quite a voice so it was easy to find does she happened to say something about incredible power that's Roger information about a weapon called Poseidon's were in here right what does it write what I say on it I have come here and will lead this passage to the farthest end of the world oh so we didn't know how Roger wrote that on the pond igloo but Odom was the one wrote it on him a word crazy all the stuffs come together and he's like like this good work Odin I'm going to the end Roger the goal for which you risk your life the final chapter of your great adventure and then it says revelation after revelation and that's fact this chapters all revelation like we saw white beard versus Roger the vodka pirates versus though a white beard pirates and this ends the stupidity but the Roger pirates are stronger than the wife you're pirates like ok nah ok they fought each other for three days and three nights with the weight of the battle shifting nobody ever getting the upper hand until they Troost but that shows you how stinking powerful these groups were they were not stronger than the other like they were both the top tier crews of the whole thing and then we just saw all these stuff coming together like you saw that Odin was the one who wrote Rogers message on the phonic lifted in the sky islands that we seemed so long ago for some of the og leaders like 16 years ago for me it was a few years back when I started my 1pz journey like this is insane this is nuts this chapter was amazing last chapter of the decade throwing back to the last decade like you feel me like a decade ago was when we are more than a decade ago probably was when we saw Rogers message at sky island and then it ends the decade with calling back to it the last decade decade not decade like that's crazy you feel me dang this chapter like I'm not good at understand I get the shaft of solid eight out of ten like we've seen some goat stuff in this chapter like this chapter was truly a good decade closer you feel me this was a decade closer for sure like dude they did this crazy this crazy crazy love bruh I know I keep saying this crazy but it's great yo a decade call back at the end of the decade wipe your burst of Roger pirates owned and joining the run pirates we were all wondering how and why Odin would ditch right beard but he asked white birds permission so you know you whew me that's insane and it was there was no animosity bro this jobs good like this is the last chapter the stinking decade the decade closing chapter this was a pretty good chapter so like predictions for the next chapter I'm pretty sure that it's gonna be called back to 1o like I'm not sure what we'll learn I feel like it's gonna probably focus marijuana with the next chapter in like a month or so that's what I feel like it's gonna do but I'm not sure like there's so many places that could go from here like it could go to a laugh tale it could go to um why don't like the story could branch out from so many places from here the flashback could branch out from so many different places like I can't really say where it's gonna go but all I can't say is wherever it goes it's gonna be like it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be hype this chapter was pure - Roger pipe you're pirates chillin together fighting each other trade you members you feel me scene Odin right the skyline a sky island stuff the fact that Odin can understand the point of glyphs and write in the language like in this dope this this was a crazy good chapter eight out of ten of my opinion great stuff so that's probably where I'm gonna have to sign off for now great chapter eight out of ten you know what's up thanks for watching if you know my content and all my content like go subscribe to notifications for more one piece of content comment down below what your agent if the chapter was like out of ten you know one out of ten 10 out of 10 five out of ten you feel me and yeah I will see you in next video", "MLpi-gOpHZ0": "hi guys okay i got this device and why is it moving focus okay oh that's annoying okay got it from amazon so that i could project from my device onto my tv set i hope but that's how it comes packaged okay the package is resealable so you don't have to wreck the packaging comes with instructions i'm guessing some kind of power cord and then this device here and an amazon gift card which is awesome dang it i could have used that yesterday but anyways maybe you have to buy one of the products i'm not sure but i'm hoping this works i'm going to read the instructions and try to hook it up okay it took me a minute to figure out where the heck to plug all the stuff in even though it has instructions so you plug it in to that part and that has to be powered and this is what you would stick behind your tv so i'm gonna try that now okay dusty as you know what but i would stick it into the hdm2 slot okay i'm really annoyed because as you can see the cord isn't very long so it will not reach my power bar and plug into the back of the tv if i you're supposed to plug it into the power source first and then plug it into the tv as soon as i move the whole thing to to the tv it unplugs from the power bar so i need to figure something out and this is kind of bs i was hoping i guess i didn't read or write but i was hoping it was like uh you know wireless somehow you have to download an app called ez mira and from there that's what syncs up with the dongle okay so i had it working there for about two days and now it's been doing this for two days straight will not connect it's trying to find a connection it does that for a little while then it disconnects from the app and it starts all over again but i have not been able to get it to work for two days so nothing i tried has worked to get this back working i don't know why i checked the manual i contacted the app to see if they were having some kind of technical difficulties it's just not working anymore it will not connect its tries and tries and tries and then just disconnects after a few seconds so this is going back and thanks so much for watching have a great day", "ZOwS_9tVpyA": "what used to be a piece of plastic are on radome and a bunch of PCBs and death metal now is a very sophisticated piece of electronic gear that every operator on the world depends on or obviously some of the suppliers here or making those products so I just have a very quick session to go over some of the trends with regards to spectrum of what's happening what's going on with broadband technology perspective and how that may impact antennas and then what is obviously happening in the very high frequency bands that we've been doing feel cloud over here and it really isn't Helen TSU as we're thinking about before and how's that going to be impacting the industry with regards to testing some of these solutions that are out there and that I think test is going to be one of the major areas that some of this thinkers may be discussing later on today terms of about sixty members how do we effectively test some of these systems so we have a this is a repeat of a slide that I did back in November but in the purple there I highlighted some of the new areas of activity so back then biopsy had not finished these six hundred megahertz auction from the FCC and so that's out of the way and uh now now the question is what kind of a Kenneth follow these are English for down at 5.50 makers all the way up into the the mid sixties and upper sixes for that spectrum BAM fourteen or eighteen T has now been awarded for firstnet and again the question becomes breaking team depending on which states are often interrupting our or regardless if they're often dropping out what are they going to be doing with regards to their in Kenneth's strategy and their OneTouch focus in terms of get you to the site and what does that mean for the industry as we move forward and adding gang or tina out there from a network side and we're not going to talk about obviously via the antenna the hick Euler or for the handheld's for the dual mode Delta 1825 products that would be out there but just from a networking side where does it make sense to Q by Q versus 4x4 with regards to their fortune for a compete specifically and then CBERS is it again another hot topic now that we have some of the initial database is set up and some of the administrators set up and have done their interoperability testing how quickly did you roll off CDRs so from a recap of a 600 negatives winners t-mobile obviously bet big on 600 megahertz and BEC big in terms of actual depth of spectrum so there nationwide footprint is primarily 15 to 20 megahertz and every market that they got looking for it and that was very important to them if you've seen over the last couple of weeks some of the information coming out of your mobiles that they're going to be focusing their 5g on 600 megahertz so the question is how does that happen or how does everyone work what are they give you binding ass Viking with regards to STIs and maybe related to current routine peeping specifications etc this is again out there kinda or as much spectrum as possible and again there nationwide footprint was a little bit less t5 you can make it worse and there's numerous maps out there on the internet that you can pull up it will give you the actual footprint by market I obviously didn't want to go through all back here and repeat that but certainly look those up and see where they focused on but specifically for dish the 20 megahertz that they got in New York City 50 megahertz and San Francisco and the Miami Metro market was of the key areas they were going to close not that they dig deeper in terms of their bidding 18 he just went into service elect markets and not go after a nationwide footprint and then we have Comcast now and cable side and getting back into it just originally in AWS one you can remember they had bit on the spectrum probably decided that it really wasn't for them and didn't end up deploying it and I think variety of getting most of the spectrum of the cable guys at K for back at AWS wanna so again is looking to buy - what's really driving on this I think the key point is begin to look at the displays on your television the displays on your devices and as we go from Canadian video to change place the 4k 4k really the magic number that I talked about before and I don't think my beings have changed on that right to go forward in that we will have 48 hands that's coming out on the end of this year and that will be a major driver for trying to do need a VLP able to get the higher stage of a product you a cellular again that certain markets that they were targeting primarily Midwest with obviously located but also some on the west coast and then pretty much in the North Carolina Virginia and West Virginia areas and then cease fire again because of what their based pretty much focused on Mississippi so we have 14 it is interesting because now we're adding and get another we have radius and these are obviously narrow dominative so we could have been 12 F 914 we can have 80 50 and we can have a whole bunch of lobe and radius now that potentially there going to be 2 by 3 or 4 by 4 one of the things back in November of last year that was discussed was would going to 4 by 4 really be a high band only situation for most of the operator problem and the thinking would look for mobile role Congress in Barcelona released this year that Brazilian Rome was going to try to focus on a 1920 100 and maybe 2600 of your international or in Canada to do 4x4 and we're going to leave the lobe and if I have to buy tuned for a variety of different reasons but for any of you that went to Barcelona it was very compelling to see every network equipment provider show a 4x4 a little ban remote radio unit at the ship so every single vendor had 800 and 900 for bicycle or at 700 for by 4 so that really from my perspective coupled with the fact that if you want to do gigabit LTE and three carrier aggregation you needed one little band that had to happen so that changed the way the four packs are going to look on the antennas from what I was thinking on back in November to where I think things are going to me now as a new Ford in 2017 and beyond so that was a major change at least my perspective is we keep ours going in upgrading the little man relative IQ only to a 4x4 configuration at least one of those bands if not more if you go back to again BAM 14 we have its 90-day opt-in opt-out period for all the states to decide their own network they're going to go onto the AT&T network and certainly even if they opt out that doesn't mean that agent gate won't build in that market because one of the stipulations format 14 is that they can use it and share it with the first responder so there's no first responders there they get all that spectrum so they're going to be deploying every market and every 50 states regardless of Interstates opt in or opt out they're going to be deploying probably four by four where it makes sense in the dense urban markets and probably to bite you in the role market and again all this will start to happen sometime this year sometimes the end of this year when you talk to you and if you're talking to corporate ATP photographers and the original market simulator and what everyone is saying but it's certainly moving forward there are cells and legal issues I think they're not resolved into two states in firstnet that have to go through at least some some soft consultation with the FCC and how things are going to work out that I think we're going to see things move floor very quickly and again I think this adds another five two megahertz a band with 480p and again these were carrier gauges in those markets and because it's low Graham is going to be very tough for them the supplement their existing 750 CDRs spectrum asus access system the database that the admins are going to be focusing on to make sure that if the Navy decides we're going to turn on the radar everyone gets off of that channel and on shut down their transfers so we have advocates now that have been designated which have Interop testing that's been done by federated in Google so things are moving forward and again would expect that we'll have more clouds from multi fire Alliance and from the other organizations out there they're dealing with CDRs as an engagement for the end of this year and accelerating in xx key", "w6oTyUbbg14": "question of course is one piece one pieces looks good and we got a one piece live stream kind of a follow-up live stream for chapter 956 we're here with frozen dawn what's up bro what's good man okay yeah yeah you were saying something yeah we're just gonna say like mr. frozen don't Tom I'm glad to be here okay cool so the streams kind of like 956 with the warlord abolition the world our system initiative bukai abolition system that's gonna have a lot of ripples all over the one piece word if you know what I'm saying that's just kind of gonna go to every single corner because the warlords are supposed to be one of the three balance and powers even though to be honest I don't even really see how they balance the world out that much because they're kind of just an extension of the world government okay so oh yeah so I guess part of the reason it's kind of a big deal well it's a big deal but it doesn't seem as much of a big deal as people are making it out to be I kind of feel like the Warlord's are gonna have to do with something dating back to the void century and that's why it's such a big deal and it's a bigger deal than we're thinking but the Warlord's just individually I just kind of want to discuss right now sorry right now at least for now where do you see the war lords going like each of the warlords like take Beau and Hancock for example she's her island surrounded by Marines and even she even if she ends up beating them back what she gonna do she can't hold them off forever you know and I'm saying where do you like the vision Hancock going that's a good question I don't believe she has any way of communicating with Luffy maybe Rayleigh and that will be interesting to see it may be like I don't know get in touch ever really maybe he comes through and like he settles he finds like a place for them to settle you know me or they could defend their territory to to the death and like maybe maybe the raising of the cops back up you know I make the fight they're all spread out and I there's not enough men like a whole army of Amazon Lily women you know man that's true but I actually kind of envisioned them possibly going to want Elsa I know a lot of people are always saying this person one one oh this person's going to want Oh even at one point I was saying and now might show up tomorrow because of the - tattoos and he lives on the moon that's a bit of a stretch that still kind of believe it but that's a whole different story but now that we know x-drake is part of sword and you have Kobe contacting them I feel like the information might get leaked so I could see them going to wanna but I'm not quite sure on that you think that'd be interesting don't be interesting I don't see Hancock I don't know how long sorry I don't know how long it would take them to get to one Oh I know I know like they got a special cheek because that takes them across the combo and whatnot um that would be very interesting to like I know like the Navy have no mechanisms on their ships and basically go pass the combo know it safely smoothly um they'd be very interesting to see if they follow Oh Hancock - one who you know I mean I after date right get rekt no I mean cuz like they're barely get rekt it's like there's no way day you're taking a ball heck no man right because some people are kind of putting ball Hancock on way lower level than she should be uh I kind of inherent ooh tier of like opening or something but some people are saying she's like Nami level and I kind of think that's very disrespectful and super underrated oh yeah very very what level would you put Hancock on well level Oh like a strong I said she spends more thanks pass Marya Ling the more we've seen ortho well most warlords are past Moria like Maury and crocodile crocodiles probably past your primary is a different story but what did you think of that mihawk scene what I think the me rock scene oh I enjoyed it I liked that he got it you know interested again and like the thrill of being chased you know I mean you know I feel like he's been missing that for like a while even though zero is on the rise to be coming like the world's greatest swordsman I mean of course he gotta face me hawk again but I mean just the time pass me I've just been chillin he just been waiting for a challenge he order has he gets off the vine through its really bored yeah always seemed like a bored guy like right now they just a ton of vice-admiral was after him which I don't think makes a ton of sense I'm kind of feeling like they're probably gonna send an emerald after them or after him or something like that if I wouldn't never know when I what sure mo do you think would be most suited for going after me Hawk I'm kind of thinking up with some food to tour if they were descending Admiral I mean food ashore will be fine but I was thinking more of the lines of Azzaro or Greenville I want to see what Greenwood can do in a situation like that I think a lot of people want to see what Greenville can do so I know I was saying if kids were sent anywhere I feel like it's gonna be the one Oh since he already kind of wanted to go to one on the first place yeah it was it was you know what's his I just forgot that cuz it's named for a second it was asked to Kazuki about that I'm kind of feeling if he gets deployed anywhere it's probably gonna be don't want only probably it's gonna be deployed don't wanna but if they're sending somebody after me shock it's probably gonna be food at aura green bow and I agree with you I kind of want to seek green boughs abilities since there's nothing to indicate what his abilities might be of course this name is green bow but then kisser was yellow monkey and I'll kgs blink and they don't have monkey or pheasant double treats you know what I'm saying yeah you know what it's keep going percent Farah sword right I've seen a picture or image of sach uzuki with a sword on his right on his left where is the writer love this - right right it was yeah it was his right arm this is right I'm not sure I'm not sure if he's connected completely towards like the leadership of sword or is he just a part of sword you know I mean I don't think on this you don't think it's part of sort ordered it drew that well well I actually think whoa for the first thing Kobe and activate they seem to be like more respectful Marines sword some people are even thinking sword isn't even necessarily a Marine organization it's an organization with in the Marines of like the good Marines no I'm not sure how much I support that but you know Big Talk anime or anime James just changed his name to big doc anime you know him I do not I might have to check him out he got super slow-mo in a in BDA and freedom stay and silver surfer and all that but he activated an interesting video he was saying he thinks out hideous part of sword and the reason the sword was on a kinase arm is like to say okey G because defeated out key G and it would kind of make sense out key G leave there means he didn't completely leave them he kind of went like x-ray and went away as part of sword I think that'll make a pretty good amount of sense yeah I guess yeah if he did make if he did like when a smoker be a part of that as well that's a smoke a problem would be part of that but I feel like since sword almost seems like a good CP almost because CP and sort are both kind of off the charts people don't really know about them or cp9 like see peas 1 to 8 and I think CP 0 to the public kind of knows about them CP 9 is the one that's kind of off the map I feel like some Murray wouldn't want to be part of that they'd want to be in the spot like a smoker definitely wants to be in the spotlight he wants to be an AMRO or something so we can chase down Luffy so I don't think that kind of position would appeal to smoker I'm still questioning like what a smoker go from here like it's been a while since we've seen smokers since no just roses I'm not just resident punk hazard in I would I wouldn't necessarily know he's back know and ready to go no I mean like of course it's been weeks or months since it says no just about a month there kiddo cares about a month or two yeah Blake do you think he's risen up the ranks like Kobe or do you feel like he's weird like he's doing I kind of feel like smoker he's probably just chilling with fujitora right now cuz we know fujitora technically can't really go in a Marine base I feel like smokers probably gonna be tagging along with fujitora since they both wanted the shaky booboo Kai's system demolished but I think that smoker might have written up in the Rings like Kobe because rear admiral was the fourth highest rank in the Marines right and Kobe before every he was a captain and then he went up to ranks after that and became a Rear Admiral so at first people thought it was a typo and then it was come from not a typo think we're gonna find out that Kobe fought some crazy opponents maybe not crazy opponents but he fought some opponents and did something fairly big in the revery which is why he shot up two ranks in like a week and smoked done something similar not sure though yeah that was pretty amazing when I started I was like yeah Kobe yeah I was like two ranks you're rising up in the ranks speaking the characters we haven't seen in a long time that bug you seen though I kind of was hoping he changed at least a little bit but yeah bogey I feel like buddy's gotten bigger a lot bigger a flight from that cover spritz and eye color and eye color pay is OB I saw a buggy game fair by Luffy and I Luffy been I think yeah I almost got fed by and then on bowling a card with feeding smoker I think a flight smoker may come to one oh as well which I'm hoping for it cuz like I've been waiting to see him and I want him to see the progression of Luffy to feel inspired again and I want to chase after him again and want to climb up the ranks to like yeah Ketchum yeah cuz smoker actually saw this interesting theory by Ben Beckman I don't know if you remember him I know him Hugh staff 25k subs but it was a text channel so he made a new channel for his voice since YouTube demonetized text channels and all that Kabam black he made an interesting he basically figured out what smokers admiral name would be if he became an admiral that was pretty cool smokers name would probably be sure are you because white dragon because smokers personality kind of fits the zodiac dragon so yeah smoker climbing up the ranks if he climbs up the ranks I kind of wanted to be an emerald before i/o on who do you think the new gen Admirals will be oh for sure Kobe Kobe uh maybe smoker of course I think drink a beer Admiral I mean mate I mean maybe let me think about it let me think about it maybe maybe you know what the new the new keratins it's kind of crazy it's crazy to put put them out there but late they will hike though during the reverie you know I mean forget the woman named woman in the man's um mama soggy and chatting okay okay mama soggy in check yeah mama sorry that's that would actually already be her Admiral name cuz mama saw gave me instinct around a bit she should just still be mama soggy and chat and I don't know examining would be they appeared in a movie before I don't remember which movie but I heard they were in a one-piece movie so some people are already familiar with them yeah Herbert Hannon of course movies aren't canon oggi also actually kind of has this to that jackie has room yeah the same spider tattoo so people are making a lot of theories about a bet it could possibly mean that there's another marina organization like called spider or something and shocky was once a part of it and then she defected to the rocks or whatever I don't know that's would be a pretty interesting thing because Jackie she's kind of an enigma she doesn't seem that from whom you saw her but she's also seems that strong just logically she should be really strong I agree I believe she is really strong it's not hard to good no I was just gonna say what's here when you put Jackie at when I push a key oh yeah I put up there with too soon actually maybe hardness is here where you put snow it cuz come on Cyril and garper like close you know right like tactically saseru will be up there but dark is fairly up there as well I'm not I'm not very big on power scaling or scaling people no but I got a I got a good sense of where I will place people know in a Miss coming one piece the scanner one piece so yeah back to the abolition at the world Lursa stem so once the system's been demolished that's supposed to just send ripples across the whole world where do you see those ripples going I'm thinking there's probably gonna be the fall of some countries since they're warlords are now gone if there's any other countries like that like for example of the Kuja empire since they're at least gonna have to move at this point they can't stay in the same place I feel like that's like they were isolated you know like around a combo nobody will bother going over there again if they're affecting from that place a slightly for bugging them a slight they may have stumbled onto our island that was inhabited by people and like they were being you know fearful for their lives and like Nana - no she just [ __ ] [Music] so she bouquet is now abolished I feel like they they're gonna have to rise up again like after they have the map of bugging up defecting as well and blackberry Blackbeard had his own Island and I don't know I don't know what I don't know what it was before blackberry I got there or was it like white bears territory which will be interesting enough because it's called foot this when I saw the VIS translation it was called full of lay and when I saw buggies no territory it was called empty Bluffs Nami it made me think it correlates with the characters you know me yeah and and I feel like go ahead now you keep going and I feel like far as far as blackberry he's willing to go all out and far as buggy he's not willing to back it up I mean he's got his man with him but he's gonna take them into like the front lines why he's skedaddled to the back lines and just you know skirts all the way out mommy right she's gonna let them take the El or he barely gets away like but no big now because he just has that giant curtain for clothes yes party out I think you know kind of cool yeah go now imagine them being able to like actually defeat the Marines and like escaping altogether and buggy you know just being oppressed by his crewmates again no I'm just thinking that so I don't honestly kind of think that's probably likely to happen because he's got a lot of level threes and level fours on his crew and I think level by verse 2 from info down so the level fibers are just below the levels so that just below like a scroll Kyle - guys they how's uncle level characters in level 6 so levels is not a real broad you go from crocodile - bullet - Shiki but pirates would probably be just under somebody like a case of crocodile so maybe somebody like Frankie so if you got a lot of Frankie level characters just fighting for you you're probably gonna be able to bust through the Marines at least find an opening to cut through you're right I feel like Bucky's probably gonna escape and I don't know I feel like once now look the warlord system's been abolished you don't want to say everybody's coming to one oh but now that there's all these warlords running and by effects oh they're all their allies and all their terror victorious people it's just a whole chain reaction of people running so there's a likelihood they could get a huge ton of people coming - ah no because even though they've got what is it 4,000 people on the Alliance Cardos Alliance got 30,000 pirates know by 20,000 beasts pirates 10,000 Orochi dudes and then you got the big moms crew which is probably like 80 or 70 people give or you maybe even a hundred but they're still like her commanders so they actually have a lot of opposition so from the ripples of the abolition of the system you're probably gonna get a lot of people running tomorrow because of the fact that it's not owned by the world government so they're gonna go to war know they won't be able to be touched by the world government that's what I'm kind of thinking I'm thinking that's part of the reason the system was over to have that system but abolished now because now they're gonna be going to wha no that's not under the jurisdiction of the world government to get away from the world government some of the warlords it'll be interesting I feel like I was gonna say somebody again but it I didn't want to know triple over what she was talking about um now you can go be um I feel like if Bucky did get captured he would go back to infidel but like I feel like he would escape right out there no I going to if y'all don't like like this theory that there's a small theory day if he went to impel down mm-hmm miracle II under that crap star day he's under no no no that Devils look that he's always getting like caught up in yeah like in the mistress of no misfortunes blight I always seemed like a blessing at the end of it you know I mean like here for sounds like he found Luffy at the mmm put down but like he made it out no out of infidelity like with yes he had area Scranton of it yeah when I'm a scratch and like he had crewmates behind him like he had made new crewmates an old crewmates forward together with him and like I feel like if he go with the back he's gonna gain even more you know he went anymore and like doflamingo make it out of infidel that way I'm flying to places like Barclay was there right you want a cover page of chapter 666 yeah by light to be live yeah okay oh that happened to be alive and I was like how come Barclay is still alive because he was supposed to Gavin oh you know that full of salt attacked from Magellan and like I figured that magenta have probably had one of those bowel movements and like he parquet he probably came back down to like his normal form while Barclay skedaddled bypassed them and went went back to hiding in the prison you know me at level 55 level 5.5 and I feel like what a time but just there maybe like it looks like a sad story arc on the cover page hopefully like hopefully like Capone them graphs up you know I mean like I find Lola in front don't worry about the Lola but I hope that they meet up with each other they're like fun funner a pact to break out of impel down again and bring me go along with on with along with everybody else yeah I didn't put that together and just going on backtrack buggy we nobody's got the devil's luck so if he's like going around he's priest Barclay who would go with them to get to loose or something like that and if they don't from Ingo if they break doflamingo out doflamingo is so many times stronger than loopy was when impelled down when luffy brokaw tempo down and doflamingo is like a rival power to Magellan I think Magellan is probably a little bit stronger but doflamingo can definitely contend with him and don't forget that Venables now the new warden and Domino's now the new head jailer now I know they weren't super strong pre time-skip but you know lots of people rose up during the times gift so they might be a bit of trouble so we could potentially see our whole cover story and pail down break and that would be pretty cool to see cuz they don't from Inglewood get back out rearrange his crew get his crew back together and yeah would probably go sailing Barclay would probably go try bar Luffy you could get a lot of stuff out of that yeah yeah that's what I was thinking like I was gonna make a video on it but never did and like I don't know it just stuck with me you know I'm glad we talked about today yeah buggy is no pirate king level but speaking of memes there's just I'd say there's four means like straightening x' and the one piece of wrote one button to caesar three walk paul and for caribou did i don't i saw lots of people talking about an Ellis comfort a story but I was surprised when I got to I wanna know and saw caribou was there because I had watched the anime almost up until that point I watched the anime up until the kind of curry fight then I kind of just read the rest of my way there but I did not realize the whole cover story page about caribou getting to 100 you don't know no I didn't it was crazy I just think caribou might join the straw hats because I know it sounds crazy first but you know how Otis said that forward enemy would join now bar link in the old enemy but my eyes Barclay was never really an enemy I know he fought Sanji but the moment he met the straw hats he became their friend and then lots on he had been it was like nah this is stupid after he lost and helped them escape by sacrificing himself so my eyes he was always a friend he could be the old enemy but that kind of doesn't seem to fit me no Luffy kinda tends to turn bad people good so the fact that caribou already has beef with them and then he kinda could become like better and he's got a little get out because one thing that's all earth me is the straw hat crew does not have a little gay devil food user I'm like they got they've basically gotta making at this point they've got a fisherman they're probably gonna get a no , I don't know about Ron Klain they got a shape-shifting reindeer they've got tons of parametres xoan but they don't know how to logia you know what I'm saying something like if Nami doesn't eat the you can you can owe me then it would be a terrible would be a good fit into the crew you know what I'm saying cuz even when he was captured by them he was already being sucked into the rowdy craziness with the straw hats you think Carol yeah it would be interesting I like to know what would be his position and like what would be his dream aspirations to like want to go out to sea in search for the one piece Russia I kinda feel like some means and aspirations like oh just kind of running out of them because even with gym bags Jim Bay he had his dream was kinda to get the fisherman to go on land but they're kind of doing that without him regardless if a journey was goofy like at this point he joined the straw hats because he wanted to sail with Luffy his dream was being there with Luffy when luffy completed his dream you know what I'm saying yeah so it could possibly be something like that and with Kara she doesn't really have a dream but I would be so shocked if she didn't join the straw hats and speaking of joining the straw hats there's somebody I think will rejoin that straw hat so I think you know who I'm about to say uh rejoin ya Jimmy right nah Jim Jim Bay is already joined vivia please I thought oh I thought this was kind of dumb but what it did say DB was an official straw hat member and I was kind of like well that doesn't make a ton of sense to me but now that we know some big incident happened in alabasta that probably involves Sabo and Blackbeard's heading over there I'll talk about Sabo in a minute and there's this whole theory that Cobra got assassinated and Vivi is on the run it could be the opportune time from VB to drawing up with that rice was more BB so weak but weak like she could have gotten stronger over at the time skip past and gotten a little bit stronger if she had heavier plans to join the straw hats once more but also friendship was always a more important than strength and Lupe's eyes from the get-go oh they just always happened to be strong for the sake of the plot your and I think we become potentially join the straw hats again yeah that would be interesting do you see Lucy going back to where Mary Jo's or heading back the other way just to say VZ or Sabo it's possible I mean if it comes out in a newspaper today somehow so got K attempted to kill coach you know V viewer the fact that they set up Sabu like make it seem like he killed a cobra and maybe ran off away with Vivi no I mean like what do you think point oh I think I was definitely possible because after Juan oh the only two arc scene or three arcs we know are gonna happen this wrath tell L bath and the final war but that doesn't mean there aren't gonna be arcs in between because I know Oda said won't be sent in five years but we all know that's like eight years after minimum so could potentially be in art cuz after Juan oh I don't know so first of all before I say this do you believe there's a difference between Admiral and Yoko in terms of just like the strengths the difference you think or to be more blunt do you think young curls are stronger than Amaral's young girls are stronger than animals yes okay so that's what I'm trying to say right still the thing is after wha no so here's the thing I know a lot of people are saying roofies not gonna be uncle level after wah no but I think one he'll at least contend with an admiral I'd rather him be contending with an admiral but at this point they're facing two yonkos and even if one piece does end in ten years if you've got those three arcs and the last line of war are should be a ginormous arc and then if you're trying to squeeze in one or two more unless one piece will just go for another 15 years what I kind of opened up with it anymore and oh that I don't want to look back on food stuff is work at this point if Luffy comes out yong-chol Louisville after 108 B or even Admiral level but say Janka level there might be a marine for 2.0 or him going to save Sabu or maybe in a different manner it's a put ton of people just to like prove that this is now a you know super powerful overpowered Luffy so I do think the idea is possible I don't know I don't want to count out dragon though just yet I don't want to count out the fact that a dragon is wanted to confirm that if his second-in-command is you know really if you if he did whatever he did in the newspaper you know I mean or if you have or whatever happened to like him in a newspaper you know I mean I think yeah he could play a part in to like going back towards Maryjo us and looking for Sabo or Luffy can do it I don't know I'm not sure how it's gonna go but it will makes more sense if dragging got off his tush and like as he made a plan in motion to like secure the second make a man and find out the real true for behind a paper that Morgan spit out so like yeah we did forget about big me more yeah yeah I was gonna talk about a second before we do do you think that was that like I don't think many people think he's dead but there's only one thing that kind of indicates he could possibly be dead I don't think he is the fact that Blackbeard said we'd I don't want to let it fall into the hands of the Navy we're setting out the fact that no stir the marinara know me for a while could mean I was actually dead but then again if the newspaper said he was dead and he wasn't actually dead that could explain why he's going out but I think black bear might be after the mera mera know me so the newspaper even if Sabo himself isn't the newspapers might have said that Sabo is you know dead I feel like the newspaper made us sell a little bit more than what it should have sir and I feel like the fact that good and I think that's what the newspapers usually do yeah and I feel like far the BlackBerry having the insight to like the pic thing wet sure what's good and what's not no I mean what's true and what's not true I feel like he has a good chance I feel like he had to get a head on the shoulders to the pace to the paint like oh yeah that's the stuff that's it that's the mark that's the blaze then you know I know I [ __ ] in a high Sheen you know where he finds no lazy man award and like he goes to this to that place you know I mean I fight black bears doing the same thing and like play says like no that was nonetheless up there came i'm not a chance not a chance for I'm I'm talking about like way back when he was flying yellow like oh yeah yeah yeah and like I'm thinking like Blackbeard is gonna like fine pluton or maybe he might go out to shield sure Hoshi because like even though she's with guard her from not gonna be there forever like he's gonna leave like I feel like and I feel like blackberry has a way to get you know down to see and like you know sneak his way into our er Ryoga whoo-hoo kingdom reuse Kingdom and I he make his nasty Roche useful there's like did you be honest your host he is Poseidon yeah besides glutton you know Cheryl she is Poseidon and my I don't know if people know that I'm cared to see what Carrie booth was telling somebody you remember that I don't know if you realized you read the cover story of the light caribou was calling in towards someone I like he was looking he was calling you calling someone to inform them about the weapon put beside him cause he had heard right and I think I think was a little bit I think was I think it was a little bit into like the chapters as well yeah over but he has stopped by Lucy no all right sure hope she gets I think it's possible because even though share Hoshi is a annoying I it's really doing but even so let's be real he's just by default went but strongest people perhaps the strongest individually she's literally yong-chol up because if she's younger level if you're in the secrecy Sea Kings are fairly weak if you get a fatty Kings coming up at your ship from underwater I don't care if you big mom Luffy black beard or Qaeda war with Cairo you might be able to get your crew on your back and fly away or big mom maybe get a cloud to escape but either way your ship is going down whether you escape or not yeah so sure horse she's pretty powerful and that something Blackbeard could definitely go after and think about this what was the possess what would the exact thing that black bear said in that in that panel well do you remember what with the desire thing to blubbers the of chapter 9 56 yes let me search it out real quick because if this if this what I'm thinking right now it could be that I wanted only from the chaptered oh yeah I'm uh I'm pulling up the chapter right now I'm gonna read it a word-for-word what you mean he says okay I'm on knife it's it's right now just a lady net land in the hand of the Marines I'd rather much take it for myself let's listen fall in the hands of the Marines yeah well dead of letting it land in the head of the Marines I'd rather much take it for myself you see I was thinking like what if it was like the national treasure no merger was but like that would be far no way that wouldn't be like it wouldn't be correct fires I don't think the Marines would know like of a such a natural tragedy is this it's not for doflamingo says he did know about it and like that's the reason why he was still empowered and like he roam freely you know Anna when not if it is what I think that could that could have been then it may have something to do with a a weapon you know I mean I'm a destruction and it could be sad blue like the headlines could have said anything from Sabo having to do a pluton to just sample dying to just sample in the national treasure or something fighting an admiral or something like that so be is a very real possibility and speaking of the news what do you think of big hands Morgan oh man Morgan's fader news Morgan's like throwing hands Morgan the fact that I just recently found out that he with his own it made it even more better just like imagine his hybrid form right because I was saying in my last video I just released a video today how strong is big news Morgan but I was sitting in the video I was shocked and I think everyone was shocked when no diff decipher poll agent even though the cypher poll what sacra Poli was from it wasn't specified it was kind of just like psycho poll agent probably CP 9 or CP 1 or C 2 or CP 3 like CPS 1 to 9 definitely not he's 0 because he didn't resemble a CCP zero agent right but Morgan's didn't even have a scratch on him and he just like it was evident that he was supposed to have like knocked him out just like one too you know what I'm saying but yeah the thing is I it was saying we shouldn't know because well especially when we found out he ate the tortora know me Marlowe Albatros he's always in his hybrid form let me know high performance the strongest form of the zone so we shouldn't know that he would be there a little bit but the biggest thing is he was introduced as one of the underworld bosses next to somebody like Stussy and Stussy is a pretty powerful cp0 agent so at the time we kind of just assumed he's only an underboss because of the influence and the knowledge he possesses not his strength but I think it was should have been a better parent that he knew how to fight at least somewhat and that makes me and that makes me not wanna like shy away from my you know dis only the fact that Orochi is seems to be a lousy character or know a goofy character just like just a goofy character and I feel like you should possibly be strong you know me I think a rope she is actually very strong I still actually think he might be throws and game and not he might be throws and game in not King because Orochi we know he's got that ginormous yeah that crazy down fruit it's not a smile right it's not a smile yeah it's just enough so when you got a eight headed snake dragon Devil food you got to be strong and they know when he saw sorrel coming at him he was like ah save me but you know then again one he could be trolling or two he could because the thing is like remember kids roux she's like uh when Ben Beckman pointed the gun at him and considers like ah Ben Beckman and Ray stands up now of course I think Ben Beckman is strong and bettan and was kind of a threat to kiss rule but you can't tell me that Ben Beckman had kids root and check me then kids rule could have taking them on through was just like I don't feel like fighting ha ha so kind of thing O'Reilly right right so I feel like it might be something like that with Roachy cuz oda has done many things there has only been one devil fruit he went he let go to enormous waste but the potential of the devil fruit wasn't really I'm not even sure owner realized the potential of his own devil fruit at the time the time talking about his waffles devil fruit because if you think about it if Walpole eats gluten the man becomes a living pluton that devil fruit was hacked but waffle had not obtained but you know the fact that odors like grow much more since the drum island arc and the fact that I wrote cheese down fruit as hyped up could be strong from the beginning I'm thinking about a rope should probably will actually be strong cuz I don't think Oda would let that big of a devil fruit that's strong enough of a devil fruit go to waste I'm curious to see a roach is Harvard from I know it's have we seen it nah what we saw it through I'm pretty sure we saw it through the curtains but I don't really count that as seen it it was just uh shadows and wonder how tough those snakes are no roaches back I wanted to take a carry likes big no swords or a katanas and like you know be more versatile getting like just attacking and grappling in I don't know right swallowing your would not you know me so you know black lady black leg then smoke hundred K subs texts channel probably not a good one piece channel out there I made he made a video saying that a rope she's gonna be an eight swords I'll user against arose um upgraded Astro nine sword style and I still think that's possibly can happen because the way Orochi was hyped up before I know I feel like Odin might be trolling us with the whole Iraqis a goofy weakling thing because Roshi he's got this hacked up flew as I said and he did I know was backed by Qaeda when he took over one oh he's still did take over wanna you know what I'm saying so yeah I'm thinking he it might be like a Maria thing where he used to be overpowered but he repressed and then as Ronald progresses forward he'll go back to what he once was at least for a little bit so yeah so I'm kind of think that might be what's up with the Roshi but I'm really hoping is rolled by to rotate and knocking because that'd be really hype didn't who I actually hope will fight King so I don't think nah I'm thinking whoa could be Sanji because then again like I'm thinking son if Soros if Orochi is like first tender if luffy became Janka level at figures or would probably become admiral level if we're just going by I'm comparisons but I'm not sure if orochi's admiral level or if Sir will be or if Louie will become York level but I'm actually thinking law might take on King because if you think about it lost over food so first of all law does use his Appa Appa no me but he is a pretty dang good swordsman you know what I'm saying yeah thank King he obviously uses fire and he flies around right and the laws W is the perfect counter to flying yes so I'm thinking that law might actually take on King but that's just not a very popular opinion by ice do you think there's not I mean it's not popular but it's very possible because we don't know who's gonna fade who or who's gonna catch the fade and I'm very very interested on you know what's gonna come next and alright I'm looking forward to like all the straw house fighting equally alternatives of I like having equal fights and like a heavy actual fights any bizarre and even if some more off-screen or put it put to the side you know I mean later I feel like we gotta see each individual parallel we got a seal I've seen on boost because same I feel like Chuck almost like choppers grown like fire though boost I don't like nominal fire at the booze but I feel like Oh sounds been working on nom his weapon a flight Frankie's probably worked on Mommy's weapon a little bit I'm not sure I feel like they both Frankie and boost I worked on Sanji's no race suit and uh I'm care to see what you stopped implants or this techno his technology in missing this weapons because like who's been on a back burner you notice that he has I'm thinking that okay so there's two things I always kind of wanted to see somebody eat at that devil fruit and I just went there two things know I kept praying for like please can you stops Kabuto eat a double food and Konami eat the you can you can owe me you can you can owe me with there's no snow fruit by the way we're completely salami and I think loose up several fruit not it was ops weapon hit like his slingshot having a double through will be pretty sick in a good power of um you know what no it's funny doesn't his devil fruit taking water to like grow oh yeah you right yeah I got bleep Boise what if he made a new weapon doe wait he made it completely new weapon and like he immigrated with a devil fruit yeah somehow that's true it'll be interesting so uh also Nami you think she'll eat the Yuki you Kaname where is it so she responded well here's the thing that you can you can owe me went on I said I'm pretty sure you've heard of this theory right I'm not sure Monay dies right there were two omma there were two things that there were two fruits close by there what are those apples that were completely overtaken by the gas and then there were girls then there was the tangerines on nominees orchard but I'm pretty sure it was closer than the apples so what a gone to either of those two so the big theory is that you go me jump for one of the tangerines and Ami's I'm Orchard oh I mean I know Nami is just like I mean I'm not gonna try I'm not trying to put it out there blade she's pretty much faster am i her like not have not being able so I take barrels and stuff like that it would be a disadvantage to her as a woman you know I mean and I feel like well I don't know I don't know if I would go that route I'm not or the editors maybe look no like not a design yeah like very strict I mean they're yes-man polite at the same time it's like yes but not they wouldn't want to go that far well you know with the yeses like no no Oda we need water we need water yeah I don't I'm not sure but then look at Rodman the day look at Robin you know I mean I didn't think about how the woman needs hockey and she's just right like what she wants hockey she'll go so far because just imagine her taking on but the thing with the straw hats is they all got to get some big power so because let's be real people want to act like this thing can happen but AOS they're gonna be Roger pirates level or above Luffy said that numerous times though they're all gonna have to even though it seems like just a bunch of plot and stupidity and dumbness right now oh right even if he does it by a ton of flowers it's gonna have to push them up to that level at some point and that's all a problem start in this arc yeah I feel like I was gonna find some way to incorporate everyone until I forming this big bad group you know like of you know bad arses and like I feel like we started is gonna have his final in his real moment to shine and like not you know not went on you know the fault no from no just from like I miss out our flights as you have a showdown work it's like to the like to the death like it's gonna be on the lines and like he's gonna prevail and like he's gonna win or it could go down the other route where he's you know I don't know yes well we're gonna status that's why we're gonna say like I'm not sure I want to go ever out justice I love loser no I'm new you know speaking of double flips in particular so do you know who monkey week is monkey reach her mother's win beep is he in be da or not he's this youtuber he's this anime youtuber who got types of channels he's got phantom man a hunter hunter channel with 13k subs monkey Rick 1p channels like seven point eight K subs or a K then he's got one seven deadly sins one my hair I'll kid he's just not a ton two channels but I made this video that went pretty viral that was talking about angel fruits and there just struck me I was like hold up there's devil fruits what if there was a no fruits what do you think of that like the last yield dragons be using the angel fruits against the devil fruit users and the celestial dragons don't eat devil fruits they eat angel fruits and they all have angel fruits are like all the high ranking ones have angel fruits or something like that what you think of that prospect it would be interesting it'll be like the Paris killer would shift completely if that was the case cuz I don't know how you would like GIP has a whole lot of fandom going any saint over angel fruits no I mean like people gripe over it I thought people will gripe over it to the death for them not me oh my why blow to do that what about to do that what about to do that even though he already introduced the time time fruit which can only go for an hour backwards thank God I'm just if ill boggle my mind if oh they actually I put angel in there at a time like this and like it changed the game completely I mean we still gotta get it go ahead I'll say maybe it would be something like there are only angel fruits but angel fruits are all but extinct except for one angel fruit and I'm Usama has it I think that a bit and I'll be crazy yeah cuz I'm curious to see and see if he or she actually has one and I'm also curious to see where are these now I mean like were they hiding if they're already here it's going to be the last island yeah because and also I just really hope we see Goofy's mom because everybody was saying Oda said should be ugly but apparently if the translation it seems like he was saying should be like Stern and almost like an ugly personality almost like Sakura always punching Naruto or something right Nami yeah like yeah yeah I kind of really want to see his love his mom yeah I wouldn't mind I was thought much about Lucy's mom I'm I'm not sure if she passed or not I'm not even sure if she cuz I know a dragon was like I cannot wait to see Luffy and dragon they ever Mino is and I can't wait to see like the interactions like his dragging just as goofy as Luffy underneath all that hard exterior or is he's I don't know cuz there was one panel I forget exactly what he said but he made a face that was exactly like Goofy's right I know right it was when I'm a koala was asking him like telling him about luffy dragon was like like that luffy bored face so i think that might actually be the case and on the subject of like dragons abilities or his connection with Lupe's mother or whatever I've tried to think of like theory surrounding all those things but until I was like you know what no matter how hard I try I'm credit list you know what I'm saying you're right your credit list when you get into those waters it's all speculation like even in my video when I was saying how strongest Morgan's the only thing we have to know is that he's got a devil fruit and he's uh you know what is an underworld boss I said in the video everything beyond this is speculation because sometimes it's a struggle but I try not to present my speculations as credible theories yeah I feel like good no I was just saying so dragon is a hard exterior luffy goofiness I definitely think as possible because I think we might have even seen a hint with that yeah um how do you feel about GART cuz like I feel like garb and Luffy are is very similar like they are I fly fly Luffy would go down a path of guard and not dragon you know I mean like I feel like Siddhartha is very intelligent and very intelligent but he's still look goofball that's it no no inside and like I just don't want to see the Luffy go down that his path as a man you know and good and his own path as a man you know me I don't want to see him I don't want to see him get all tough up no in front of his father I want to still be in know right maybe I'd be Hardy here right I mean we've always seen that Luffy deviates from the path of his family members like even Lucien even a subsample just look really one of the top commanders of a strongman salvos became one of the top commanders of a strongman Luffy goes and becomes these strongman you know what I'm saying yes so I was always kind of deviated from that and even though I think he still would be kind of a little bit similar to GARP like he'll cook Karpis goofy he just won't act tough because like when odor drew Luffy um when he's uh 40 years old the resemblance to GARP was definitely there you couldn't really see drag him but you could definitely see sharpen that based yeah I find that interesting that odors giving dragon emotions you know I mean like he was a bit worried of for Sabu and like we don't usually see that of dragon so it makes me wonder like who is dragon you know who is like who is the man yeah it makes you wonder it and it makes you makes you fight is a oda setting up dragon to be a you know a heart a heart hat or it's a year tough guy or is he a sensible guy he could be a sensible guy like Zurich oh you know I mean he could be hard but still care right and I feel like ever since ever since we found out that dragon I always face to the left or was it to left or the right whenever he was on on that one island that it got ransacked by the Marines because of cuz of uh to the who was it it was the champion guy Burgess Oh Burgess Burgess yeah yeah ever since dragon was looking towards the love where Luffy position was over in the east blue it makes you wonder are you really tough are you really alright he could be he has to be well he has to be like yeah he has an army I feel like he's sensible but still fun the loving if that makes sense yeah I agree I agree like like like like Zeff like myself I feel like I feel like he will fit into the world he has to like you cannot have a character that just doesn't fit into the world Lumpy's you know me right but did you notice how koala was telling him off with the whole Luffy thing kind of resembling Nami telling Luffy off that's what I'm kind of thinking me probably is gonna be a bit you know less hard and tough than we think but he's gonna have the intellect he's gonna have rather like the ability to lead the ability to toughen up when need be but when he doesn't need to toughen up he's not gonna necessarily be that hard imposing Manion that's kinda what I'm thinking dragon might be right now but of course we need more information later on in the story as the story progresses that'd be very cool to see I hope we get to see that in a very soon I would say oh I wouldn't say like oh we get to see the light Laird I mean like very soon cuz like it's very important so I not deviate enough by too far away from what we just seen and my I know we're gonna go back to LA no I know we could go back to one oh but like are we gonna see a little bit more else the revolutions are we gonna see a little bit more buggy night on the Warlord's or the formal war alerts are we gonna see more Kobe or are we getting Hawks bounty yes are we gonna see batteries so hoping for his bounty put the whole warlord anime shows huh what the anime shows it instead that it'd be a bit stupid I feel like because I mean it took a little bit longer till I see it's left out by I don't know because I feel like in that chapter anime shows up at the month it doesn't everybody's gonna be saved not Canon belty not Kanan bounty right right yeah you're right you're right I feel like in that chapter there was a lot of uh there was there was a lot of time going back and forth you know I mean yeah like like it was like time segue towards like the next the next part I feel like they were just gonna fill it out I feel like they're gonna have to fill it out in the anime like they're gonna show like multiple scenes getting flushed out but I don't feel like they're gonna show the newspaper though and like I don't know where it's coming know where it's gonna go at the end of it you know just gonna wait the next chapter and luckily there's no break yeah Oh Hulk there's no break it like I was shocked oh is it a break between acts but like we saw this with chapter 9 25 it just went from the world of war notebook rest of the world then went back to one oh I think that's what's gonna happen next chapter and we might get more be like insight on what can happen at the beginning of act 4 so that's summer look or - and I was gonna say something else that was pretty big but I can't remember what it was oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry no no that was hitting you I my mind just kinda just thought a lot like I'll be thinking of something to say but because I'm thinking of it I won't remember it yeah well I'll forget it as I'm beginning to say it that's what it more yeah but similar yeah yeah I feel that I definitely definitely feel that but Kobe so what's the whole sword thing like how strong you think the sword even it is it depends on like how deep it is like he's like gotta be you know a part of that as well probably like you did I mean a monkey D family thing you know what I'm saying they're much more kind of hard hitters cuz even if even though dragon did kind of you stuff to save Luffy from buggy but I feel like that was probably I guess dragon is kind of a stealth guy with seem to I can do a lot of stuff things but like l\u00fathien are definitely they're not the stealth type of person okay how do you feel about him elbow being real like right now I'm not sure blight even if they didn't show even if they did showing him up Oh like how do you feel about him being a rare animal I'm right next to Kobe so here's the thing with Hema Pope I actually made a theory about it a while back was called rose marina rival I feel like if Xaro has a marine rival it's gonna be helmet though because we know that helmeppo uses his cope ash or khopesh I think the code let me just see I think they're called khopesh Zorro said are not khopesh it was like I forget what it was but it was that weird shaped sword and Zorro whoa it takes a man of those are hard swords to use like saying how my PO you got skills to be able to wield those and helmet Poirot go as far back as being Kobe as loopy when looping back Kobe that was around the time zero and helmet promet and helmet ho had sorrow crucified up on the like had him crucified up there so the fact that there he goes that far back and their beef goes that far back I feel like helmet post gonna kind of be trailing just behind Kobe so he's gonna also be fighting Zorro like sometimes maybe not like equally was all but he's probably gonna definitely be fighting Zorro since they got that much history and they're all even acknowledged to swordsmanship briefly yeah so that I see if I feel like Alma Poe if he's a real Admiral that's um I don't think that's out of left field I think that's a reasonable thing to happen how do you feel about him uh pose hockey bloomin and like oh yeah I think it's time I think it's about time that it happened because like if Kobe's a rare animal already I since nano3 since chappy 903 and like it's re skyrocket like to two ranks up I feel like it's time for him up a little just get a third branch no but then I it puts me in it ya know I keep going keep going it puts me in a position to wonder like wait no like where's the she in all of this Westland odors yeah I'm gonna be throws girls now I'm not gonna say well maybe I don't know but it was a Kobe's rate of growth from the time skip is equal to that of leafies kind of but looky what your store any stronger than him from the get-go I feel like Yoda might have has kind of mess copy up a little bit because I feel like when Kobe met Luciana on a water seven and at marineford he should have had it so that Kobe was stronger and relation to luffy then he was because now anyway Kobe catches up to Luffy whatever the reason that will say that will mean that Kobe's rate of growth is stronger than Luffy you know what I'm saying yeah so I feel like that was kind of like a battle noticed part of course I'm up a mangaka but that's just one thing about Kobe well this was a great scream but I'm gonna have to wrap it up I got some things to do it was a fun fun yeah yeah was the front string it was a streamer I would just I just had it had like a quick thought in my head like what if Kobe's like Brady level in fishing or swimming he's already I mean like what if he's Rayleigh level in swimming Oh like I think that's a pretty possible thing ssam swimming like he are rocking out here you thought I say yeah I did yep I actually kind of put copia doflamingo level and a lot of people are saying what's your issue bro or maybe not maybe not doflamingo level but I was there under so I feeling like Kobe's oriano right because the thing is Kobe's going to have to make a giant hop that seems like plot and unrealistic at some point like he's gonna have to do it sometime because of the way order has set him up so Kobe's telling us do that at some point can we speak on the right now beautiful about Coco be like surprise nice on you yeah yeah I I think he's passed charge already just read sit sorry I mean what I'm just saying like I mean it's very possible yeah I think so yeah I think Kobe's I honestly think Kobe stronger than lots of vice-admiral's he's fresh Oh stronger than a main heart and Bastille right but I think it's the theory that sword is kind of quote-unquote good Marines within the Marines like a coalition of them if that theory is correct and what makes sense that Kobe's only rear admiral if the people like a kind who are taunting him because they don't like because they don't like sword or sword was originally just a marine blue but sore has kind of grown has they have say sort has very strong ideals about the Marines and changing the Marines members of my sword might be being stunted every that could be a possible thing so yeah and then the whole thing with Col will be wait what we're saying about Kobe it just slipped out my head Kobe being like Rayleigh level in swimming yay or he's climbing he's climbing close to Rayleigh level in swimming like he'll bit he'll be able to take on Sea Kings like in no turn I feel like well I think he already can't probably my meds can swim yeah well facing the sea Kuna Sea Kings aren't honestly that share aha she would be Opie it's because of the sheer number it's almost like Sea Kings it's like Sea Kings are strong but once you get like even a little bit drum like Bartolomeo his barriers could take on a seeking I'm not trying to see once he kings cuz I know one bit all shanks arm but like let's be real that was a bit the breeze of the Sea King bit how shanks arm was because one shanks gave it up for the new generation I know but I think the biggest reason was that it was the first chapter of the series and things were completely fleshed out yet no it's crazy yeah shanks saves Luffy in the beginning and shanks stays with Kobe my in the turning point oh you write you write that never girl like oh how do you know why I like Kobe's been climbing up the ranks and like ever since I yes oh you're right my boy he has to have like a D copy I have like a D or something like come on his parents were like pirates right and we're not like what's his parents pirates or in the beginning I forgot that Kobe's parents are pirates I'm not LA I went that Frankie because I remember Frankie parents apart but I think Kobe parents were not good people I don't believe I don't remember that that might have been the thing I'm I know I'm going to the one piece wiki cuz people hate on the wiki the wiki can't trip but let's be real the wiki also is like um big fans like you or me who are just trying to type what they saw in the chapter so if I go into the history past I'm not seeing anything about his uh oh yeah here I'd intended to board a ship for a fishing trip or a fishing trip but he caught on the wrong ship I'm not seeing anything about his a pair oh wow okay okay ye I'm pretty sure his parents probably found that he's a marine and probably happy for them but yeah is this all we got it's just all the time we got a bear I'm like I'm let your and it I this was this was a doe stream I feel like we could've kept going yeah we could but other mami papi - right yeah stream - I don't know when he's gonna start she's gonna start after towns he finished 100 stream on the twitch oh there know some how to feed my twitch these stream is it mr. towns e and uh yeah mr. towns e but Tony the prophecy is streaming on YouTube and he wants me him and Trent in town Z to get together and just catch up on things because like he hasn't been streaming lately he hasn't been doing these no other late you know sir speaking of streams I should hop off of these more because like I haven't really streamed with the trend or still breeze even though silver just got his big break because of Bragg oh but you haven't really I haven't really been hopping on streams with much people other than Z boy and for trevally I haven't even streamed with Val yet so see how screams work out in the future but yeah I'm gonna and the stream here thanks for watching subscribe to frozen Daanish a link will be in the description and like subscribe to turn a notification for more one piece content share the stream if you

"_4tT3OKzi-Y": "the ITU is leading the process of adoption of standards from the radio interface mobile networks we need bad for fringing and 2004 14 2007 and we have started to do that recently for 5g another 90 you name of IMT 2020 we see it's his role as developing some of the building blocks on which phi g will be based and some of those are already very well known for example network functions virtualization and an etsy activity that's been running for quite some time now but more recently activities on mobile edge computing and looking at millimetric wave transmission for example the five trees are not just another new radio access technologies for us it's a new fabric which can help to bring our vision to life which is to expand the human possibilities for the connected world it means 52 should also be a system of systems which can be applied to other end adjacent markets in the future the requirements for different industries and different verticals will be diverse and in this sense we will look for a range of different capabilities so it isn't clear that 5g will be 1 radio access system it may be multiple ones we will not be able to create one unifying technology we may need to be able to create a unifying platform in which to pull together these different technologies to offer services to customers one of the neat things about what's coming around the corner both within FV which is required for 5g and all the 5g technologies and millimeter-wave and all that kind of stuff that are coming is that while we know if we build a big huge fat you know configurable pipe and make it were people to take advantage of it how it gets used is anyone's guess we view 5 g is really an end-to-end ecosystem that's going to provide many different customer benefits it's not only the enhanced mobile broadband will get very high gigabit speeds but it's also the ability to deliver the IOT ecosystem where we're going to have literally billions and devices in addition to that there are low latency high reliability functions that are required so it's almost a three-legged stool that will build with 5 T and the use cases around each of those really develop as a technology insurance with the Internet of Things coming up there will be situation where you don't need very high capacity you just need very inexpensive devices which can transmit a few big or second maybe only once a year but this may be of critical importance and you want these devices to be very cheap so it means that the 5g specification will have to be somewhat expendable there are certain frequencies additional frequencies for providing greater bandwidth providing additional capacity right now we've started an effort and ran to approach channel modeling which will allow us to understand better what there's what the restrictions and capabilities of these new frequency ranges entail we don't identify or locate spectrum in there to you just for five T we say this is for IMT international mobile telecommunications and then of course depending on the time when it will be available in each country this depends on national authorities in the local situation depending on that time you'll be using for 4G it's ready now on for 5g well there's a limited amount of spectrum available to us right so it's like real estate once it's used for something it can't be used for something else and so making sure that the right decisions get made on the spectrum to ensure that fives you can be utilized and can be benefit all of the users is very very important and then once you come to a decision on how you're going to use a spectrum what channel is going to make it take advantage of then the manufacturers can build the radios and the antennas and that can be leveraged across all the different carriers and hopefully it aligns with the global standards in the global spectrum so you only have to manufacture one set of components for all the different networks they need to build poor", "kAr2p4eF-b0": "hello and welcome to Telecom TV from Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona and were here in the discussion zone at the HPE both in Hall 3 and it's time for our telecom TV panel discussion which today is on the journey from 5g ready to 5g deployment and joining me to discuss this journey I have on my immediate right por crane and Paul is head of mobile and wireless at BT workable next report is Xavier Locker who is run innovation global CTO office at telef\u00f3nica and next to Xavier Edwards grace chief technology officer at the Etsy standards group gentlemen thank you all for joining us as I say now we know marketing teams love new generations of mobile it gives them something new to to sell and exciting for customers but often in the race to be first to market there can be complications no is it is it a good time to go now into 5g with 5g ready or whatever you want to call it equipment or is it best to wait for standardization to run its course and in five years case through to 2020 for the initial full standards what's the best evolution path for operators and really when is the right time to actually market 5g to customers Adrian could I ask you first of all about standards because the telecoms industry is renowned for its standards work very involved very specific but it's worked and it's worked for a lot of years how important our standards still as we make that move towards 5g I think you've you've already made the point that this industry is standards-based and I don't really hear anybody arguing about that or or putting a contrary view because over many decades we've learned the value of having a standards-based approach it's enabled us to have multi vendor interoperable solutions perhaps more importantly as we go forward with mobile communications we're looking at reducing cost end-users want to pay less and less for their terminals and they want those terminals to do even more and more things so if you want to get the price down you have to bring the scale up and that's one of the major benefits having a standards-based solution moreover want the the whole process of writing a standard is about building consensus so it it's the endpoint if you like of a lot of hard discussion but once you've made that decision it's the entire industry that then moves forward with that with that standard so the the monopolization if you like of the standard is not left to chance it's an inherent part of the consensus building process that brings us that standard you know that's one of our two operators on the panel we what's your view of standards the whole industry in particularly mobile industry that the whole success is actually based of being based on those standards and they're getting the ecosystem and the cost down so devices can work network but also so operators can work with other operators as well and that that's like being you know the key driver of the industry and will be the key driver still be key driver in 5g standards are just crucially important oh yeah it's a similar view I have exactly the similar view for us it's crucial and it's definitely of maximal importance for us to keep the standards evolving in the best way not only for technical reasons but also in order to explore the best way to reach users and to give the customers the best services and also indeed in fact G compared to previous generations we are witnessing for the first time a change in the paradigm by which networks will likely deploy a be deployed and and evolve with a different model compared to the past instead of for example having like a collection of network features and functionalities that you may for example acquire or not or activate or deactivate we want to to have something based on NFB and SDA from day one so that we can for example of flexibility blowing things up on demand and relying on standard technology as possible I mean I'd see hardware virtualized platforms not proprietary interfaces anymore and building consensus among all the stakeholders but not only for technical resources also for economic reasons so it's absolutely crucial for us I think there are there are two points that one is the standards process he's seen as being slow okay and we er we need to focus on actually how we actually speed the standardization process is crucial and secondly we shouldn't we shouldn't let standards creep into areas where it's not a central okay we should actually only focus on those areas where it's really essential for us to enable that evening that into working and to develop that ecosystem where you end up with cheap devices and you can work between operators so Adrian we're looking at a framework that standards to promote that framework and then allow vendors and turkos to to innovate around that in a more open environment you know in standards have two dimensions they have both breadth and depth so you do the important role they play is to standardize enough to enable the interoperability in the multi-vendor environment but not standardized so much that you stifle the innovation so as Paul says it's getting that right balance between you know how far should you go with standardization you have to standardize the essential elements but you don't need to go beyond those essential elements I mean you've already touched on NFV and an SDN there hopefully we'll come back to that but when we look at we're seeing especially at this show there's a lot of them the products that are 5g ready 5g enabled three 5g a lot of these are only the air interface the mobile aspect are those products really 5g ready five-year enabled is it worth as an operator seriously looking to implement those products now knowing that we've still got a long way a B said it might be slow but we said a long way on the standards process to run I mean there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer here I think they that there is a case for for doing investment particularly in the core network we all said we were saying about the transformation to virtualization and that transformation to you know nfe Sdn controlled in a 4G network and there and by doing that you've built a effectively a 5g ready core already we're already on the ran side is slightly different because you don't you don't want to do you know regret and regretful investment you you need to be really focused in that space and so yeah I think you need to be much more cautious okay that release 15 3gpp released 18 and compliance with that is where you really need to function on the round okay yeah I think for the first time I think we are lucky that some of the most advanced and interesting technical innovations in factory are indeed happening now and can be tested in 4G even in limited forms like you know millimeter waves for fixed wireless access massive my more virtualization playground these are things that will happen will have like a 100 percent advantages in 5g because the framework will be prepared for that from day one but we are lucky enough that we can test some of these innovations in 4G so in my view 4G LTE advanced and ltrs Pro is the best platform to test profile G so to say technologies and innovations to us the customer to test the capabilities of the technician that acknowledges that we are testing to know how our networks must evolve towards fighty in order to cope with the challenges ahead which octopod virtualization but it's also other things like the economic feasibility of deployments for the first time we will be able to deploy 5g in conjunction with 4G it's a different story compared to previous generations what you will be able to for example have the correlation control with 4G and yeah the widespread deployments with bolte and with data and then with Rajee in hotspot areas you will be able to provide opportunistic access to high data rates so I think it's very interesting now to use 4G as a as a benchmarking for future technologies it's interesting because when we look at the possibilities of 5g the two approaches to the radio side the new radio side as a standalone with a new cause well and there's a non stand-alone which are linked into llt area you know operators here do see as that's that's the first step is to keep leveraging LTE to introduce 5g so what's the 5g network going to look like in the 2020 timeframe and it's very much likely to be a you know an LT a pro network with islands or a grid of 5g integrated together into a hat net so so it's so it's really important to carry on the evolving your LTE network and then an introduced 5g in that context I don't think you're going to see a you know a big bang approach where it suddenly goes from from 4G to Safari I think Paul makes a very important point that is often misunderstood because yet you often hear or you perceive 5g as being of the new radio when in fact 3gpp is very clear on the fact that 5g as a system includes both the new radio and the evolution of LTE Advanced Pro it includes a new core network and the evolution of our existing core and it's that complete package which we offer as a 5g system so it's not just about new radio it's the LTE advanced pro will play a big part in delivering 5g performance and coming back to how we I would describe all this equipment and services it's there a need for perhaps a a a universally recognized term for anything that's not quite 5g to enable too costly to give Turco's some kind of security over future into a building yes I think we have that I mean I think we have 3gpp and we have really released 15 and you know I'm sure our marketing departments will like you know we'll play with VG's okay and you know when it but from an engineering point of view I think we have that already and we absolutely need to carry on with standardization and the interworking testing and an appropriate due diligence to that level to ensure that the services actually actually work and you know and you know my role is you know leading the research work is to take some of those early concepts that we've got taking them into the arms and Travel them to see you know how they buffet from a performance point of view but also how they how what needs to happen for them to winter work please have ya know I wanted to say only that you are also lucky in that for example non standalone networks will be relatively soon will be ready for testing and being deployed relatively soon for enhance mobile broadband applications but I know for example that they in many countries they expecting for example in Latin America they are expecting some form of fixed wireless access for like a rural areas open areas where non standalone versions is actually not either it is more like standalone new radio or whatever but integrated with a fixed core to provide the broadband services to households where five and for example is too expensive so we have like the two options already from up in this year and next year fisk wireless access will be ready and has mobile broadband will for sure be launched very soon and it's only the tricky point that the spectrum is not harmonized in millimeter waves yet because there's some issues with coexistence with satellites with bubbles and so on so this will have to be fixed but I think it's very good to have the two options right now no stand alone a stand alone yeah and Adrian Posada mentioned released 15 kanaky was a prefer idea of what the militia Jule is because it's not just 15 is it with with 5g can it was a brief idea of of where 5g fits into the cell the revolution I mean the 3gpp current plan is to have two phases the first phase which will enable sufficient functionality for those who want to deploy early looking around the 2018 timeframe that's release 15 and then for those who want to deploy in the 2020 timeframe there will be a second phase but I should point out that on Monday this week a number of operators have put forward a proposal that we should do what Paul says and try and actually be faster to market with our standards so you know there is a there is now a discussion that will take place next week with in 3gpp to see whether we cannot even bring that forward by a several months so it's it's a case of the standards bodies trying to respond to the operators I'm just following that point up I know that 22 companies involved in this I don't think telephonic whisper BT certainly is but just calculate why why they why they need to bring forward why is it so important it's important to us that we continue to meet our users expectations of the network and we see that that step to some of the 5g technology is being crucial not just not just for the consumer and the retail end but also for to support the other use cases that we talked about and 5g and we're seeing a real need emerging for for example low latency services and connected cars whereas we're seeing also a real need for expansion of IOT you know with particularly the sensor networks with smart cities and other applications and we want we want to ensure that those are driven forward it's a real difficult balancing act in 3gpp to you know drive the standards quickly but ensure that the vital components that are needed by operators on don't accidentally get dropped out I think actually the standards is great in journey because we want to provide customers with 5g services as soon as possible the concern that we have and the reason why I didn't support with we didn't support this this acceleration even for even fastest that than today is that there are some technical points that require deeper discussions at some levels and we think that the current progress in 3bb is too much in a hurry in order to take appropriate decisions for the future in important points like network slicing architecture going beyond enhance mobile broadband but preparing the network from day one for more advanced services more advanced use cases ultra reliable the decision of waveforms there are many points which require I think deeper discussions and accelerating even faster the standard side we think it's not the best idea we yeah we we saw this same situation in three years from how the the filling hype created like a collection of technologies very quick the organising release three release 99 and that created some provenance afterwards because technology was not matured some points there were some channels are going to reduce without the necessary level of testing and agreement and I think in Friday it may happen the same we have seen this in there for example channel coding discussions the waveforms and several things which we think it's very important for the industry to get some consensus and to bring more resource and more deeper discussions so accelerating is great for the customers but we think CBP should take its work at the proper pace so yeah it's a bit tricky there's a meeting coming up very very soon we 3gpp can you just clarify it is that the next couple of weeks and no this next week this is next week starting on Monday to Friday it's the plenary meetings where the project's highest technical groups get together to set the master plan for the next three months and that's where this proposal will be discussed and I guess there will be some long evening session as before finally at the end of the week we decide whether to stick with the existing timeline or whether we take the proposal to try and accelerate and of course there's always a trade-off between time quality and cost so you know it's it's a matter of whether that acceleration has has merit that that's worthwhile or not and and it will be for industry next week to decide on the merits of both options and it's industry-led so at the end of the week industry will have decided what the timeline is for 5g whether it should be accelerated or not I think both sides of the argument I mean both operators got exactly the same ambitions okay and what we want to achieve out of it but it'd be interesting to see how those get resolved so good luck we could continue squishing for quite some time but in a way I just want to get to next week now and see what came about that meeting is so perhaps we will have another discussion at once that that's finished but but for now gentlemen Paul Xavier and Adrienne thank you all very much indeed", "_6x_VpTaXc4": "[Music] welcome to this special edition of frequency matters they are from microwave update series on Pat handle I'm here with my co-host Gary the rude and special guests Harish Krishnaswamy co-founder and CTO at mix com welcome Harish thanks Pat thanks Gary it's so pleasure for me to be here today and talk to you guys so can you tell us a little bit about your startup that's in the 5g millimeter wave area can tell us how the company got started and maybe a little bit of history on your technology oh yeah absolutely so you know we're a millimeter wave start up with the primary focus on 5g millimeter wave particularly building front-end modules for 5g millimeter wave in the 28 gigahertz and the 39 tu Hertz in the 24 deer herd stands I'm also a professor in the electrical engineering department at Columbia University and I've been at Columbia for about 11 years now and through my research career in academia and and before I joined Columbia through my PhD my area of research is primarily focused on novelties and innovations in the RFIC design space that would enable new forms of wireless communication and so through my own nearly 20 years of research career thus far I looked at you know innovations on the RFI sea level that would enable various new forms of wireless the millimeter wave being a big one of them but also other technologies including full duplex wireless and mimal wireless during the mid-2000s during my PhD I did a lot of work on the first silicon millimeter wave phased arrays at that time you know we were looking a lot at the unlicensed band at 60 gigahertz and automotive-grade are in 77 gigahertz range and then after I joined the Columbia in 2009 I continued this research on millimeter wave with a special focus on power amplifiers and through this period of time a lot of my research has been funded by federal agencies primarily DARPA around 2015 or so after some work on the DARPA elastics program which really focused on silicon the limited wave power amplifiers and how to make an advance an order-of-magnitude advance and output power and significant advances in efficiency I started work with the folks at Qualcomm and specifically the the New Jersey location of Qualcomm you know which is obviously very proximate to us and which used to be a high-profile startup in the mid-2000s called flareon which developed a lot of the fundamental DM IP that went into 4G and was acquired by Qualcomm for that IP and through that interaction I met my co-founder Frank Ling and you know we started to look at the IP that had been developed at Columbia and you know at the same time five gene millimeter-wave was really you know taking off and driving a lot of interest and so we decided to spin out a startup company and so you know we went out we raised some money and over the last two and a half years we've been essentially commercializing this technology we've also been very fortunate in that period of time to hire some real superstars of this space so our CEO Mike Noonan we we brought him on about a year ago prior to that he was an advisor to the company and he's been you know fantastic in the decades of experience that he brings in the in the silicon micro electronics space particularly with a focus on startups and entrepreneurship we hired dr. Aaron and Rajan as our VP of RF engineering and he he's also a professor at Oregon State University but has they had a career at IBM research before that and during his time at IBM research and before that during his PhD I would say he really pioneered silicon millimeter-wave phased arrays built the first phased arrays in silicon during his PhD and then an IBM research built the first commercial phased arrays and really developed the technology that underpins large-scale phased arrays today we also brought on Aristotle Heydrich Christo's who comes from a long career at Qualcomm and XP Ericsson Global Foundries particularly at Qualcomm worked on the RF 360 effort there's a really well versed in what it takes to build front end module products in SOI CMOS and you know shipped them at volumes of hundreds of male insta billions and so now we think we've assembled the Dream Team when it comes to silicon millimeter wave for 5g and you know we really look forward to making significant inroads in space so as you well know a number of companies are making millimeter wave of RF ICS for 5g what differentiates your technology and the summit I see that you recently announced yeah absolutely so um you know certainly there's been you know quite a bit of work on on millimeter wave deployments and specifically silicon millimeter wave beam forming ICS as front-end modules I'd say that you know millimeter wave generally is quite challenged in that you know fundamentally the signal doesn't travel very far it gets very easily absorbed by anything that contains moisture whether it's you know the foliage or the human body etc and so all of these things challenge millimeter wave link budgets and stand in the way of robust millimeter wave links so there really is you know a desire from the industry for for new technologies that particularly improve link budgets as they stand and so our focus has been on that front and primarily on the power amplifier side so you know we exploit SOI CMOS to build power amplifiers that achieve higher output power and higher efficiency than the current state of the art we achieve as much as 2x higher efficiency than current solutions that are out there and so I CMOS and specifically the you know the RFS Hawaii suite of processes that GlobalFoundries all first have many things that really enable improved millimeter wave design obviously you know SOI CMOS gives you transistors with lower parasitics and so they give you a higher higher speed higher performance the back end of the line is also specifically optimized for millimeter wave but also SOI see most allows power amplifier design techniques that improve performance specifically stacked SOI see most power amplifiers that's an area that you know this founding team has worked on for many years preceding when we launched mix com dating back to you know millimeter wave stack power amplifiers from 2010 as part of the dark six programs so we've been able to bring design techniques for SOI CMOS power amplifiers that you know that advance the state of the art compared to other people that would use that same technology so you talked a little bit about the stacking to improve power amplifier efficiency and output power you know what exact technology do you add that's not already being used so stacking what it allows you to do is it allows you to you know essentially stack transistors on top of each other so while a single transistor handles limited voltage within its breakdown limits a stack of transistors handles linearly larger voltage and hence quadratically higher power but you know all those things are sort of easier said than done right especially everything at millimeter-wave is hard so as you start to stack more transistors that millimeter wave there's several you know second-order parasitic effects that come in that that limit performance and so you know we've developed techniques that that allows us to manage those kinds of effects and it allow us to sort of extract the best performance from a from a stack power amplifier especially in the context of 5g and kind of waveforms that you know that Bhaiji and it utilizes specifically rpm waveforms as deep as 64 form 256 form even in some cases with high peak to average power ratio so essentially sort of getting efficiency under those challenges is something that we've developed technology for and then you know finally I mentioned that wild power amplifiers perhaps no central duct in the entire beamforming I see you know the architecture that one exploits for for the IC and for beamforming is extremely critical as well it's quite possible to design you know the best power amplifier out there but then lose all of the performance and all the plumbing of the array so to speak and so so knowing how to architect one's array around a high-performance power amplifier to extract the best system level performance you know performance of the scale of a large scale array rather than just a single power amplifier or a single chip is also you know a critical thing that often gets inflicted and so we've developed technologies for that as well so is a small startup company you've got limited resources what kind of partner ships are you establishing to try to accelerate your growth in the market uh you know that's an excellent question and certainly I think one that really cuts to you know what Anna started needs to do to be successful in this space right because everything's expensive you know silicon fabrications expensive equipments expensive so we've been fortunate in our partnerships I'd say you know one of our most significant partnerships is with Global Foundries our foundry partner you know they've been extremely supportive of startups in this space and they've particularly you know as a company prioritized applications such as 5g millimeter wave as opposed to trying to be sort of a foundry that really does everything and for instance also explore you know tries to pursue scaling down to the single-digit nanometer notes and so you know we've been very fortunate in our relationship with local boundaries and that encompasses not just you know fabrication of the ICS but also you know the other things that go into making product including turnkey packaging of these ICS as well as large-scale tests and so that's probably you know one of our most significant partnerships that I'd really like to highlight we also recently along with the summit 28 gigahertz front-end module that we announced about a month ago I guess at this point we announced a partnership with Tao glass which is you know probably about the leading antenna companies out there and in partnership with outlast we announced a 16 antenna a smart antenna module and so you know we really enjoy and you know really look forward exploiting that partnership to essentially take these beamforming ICS to more getting the context of antenna module systems and then finally we also announced a partnership Richardson orifice RFP for global sales and distribution obviously you know the logistics associated with that are also very charge challenging for a small start-up and so that's that's a key relationship as well and so these are the three that I'd say we've announced right now we have several others that that we hope to announce in the coming quarters but we definitely see you know partnering with leading companies in all the you know auxilary spaces that are adjacent to you know the silicon has very critical to to our success as well as in general sissified Union what frequency bands are you currently covering and what are your planned releases coming up in the near future so does Summit beamforming I see that Gary mentioned we announced it about a month ago or so and that's at the 28 gigahertz band so specifically 26 and a half to 29 in like half gigahertz we will be announcing our 39 d Hertz product shortly in a couple of orders these are our primary bands that we focus on we also work in the 24 yard span which is obviously quite significant in Europe well Harish thank you for joining us for sharing mix comps approach to the 5g millimeter wave market we wish you and the team a lot of success thank you very much Gary it's you know it's a pleasure to be here and you know thank you very much for you know for the role that you guys play and for you know the excellent coverage that you provide in this space", "c1X8cOmIZ04": "so in 5g it's not just about how to use spectrum more efficiently but it's about how to use spectrum more flexibly right and one of the challenges that carriers and and all the ecosystem partners are having is that finding good spectrum paired good spectrum is becoming increasingly difficult given the fragmentation and the density of of different using the different bands so what coomer's technology allows operators to do is to take advantage of not just paired spectrum but unpaired spectrum as well because now you can operate in band full duplex in a single band doubling spectrum efficiency but also opening up the number of bands that are possible to use and still achieve very very high throughput some high efficiencies", "5AyHIPmWgjo": "[Music] so we're in London that ovum's headquarters I'm here with Daniel Gleason he's the smartphone expert at opened Daniel good to see good morning so Mobile World Congress the usual haunts that we all head to in late February each year obviously you know last year and again this year 5g is going to be the overarching sort of the topic the trend that people will be talking about the show in terms of the devices what can we expect to hear about or even see at the Sears Barcelona Show well for starters this year is the year for 5g on devices you know last year it was all very much a 72 other networks about operators getting moving on how to build up the networks but now we're fine at the point where their networks are definitely happening and the devices are coming and we're going to see the announcement of the first 5g devices first 5g smartphones at the event we're expecting things from definitely from a lot of the Chinese vendors like Xiaomi and Huawei antennas 5g handsets and probably some even Samsung will tease a 5g handset that it will be releasing later in the year so that would be the main think that even though 5g would there be a lot of devices being talked about even though there be announces announcements but those devices won't be released probably until the late second half of the year right that it's just a case of people trying to get there the word out first to be get that pure boost to get that attention on them but there will be examples people will be able to touch them because you know up to now a lot of the tests with 5g has been like all which device you testing with oh it's on this trolley over here let me bring it over we're talking about actual a smartphone device yeah exactly like Huawei only announced a few weeks ago of a new modem chip the Balam 500 that it's gonna be putting into its smartphones Qualcomm announced new modems as well a few a few months ago so all of the kind of surrounding infrastructure and surrounding ecosystem is coming together yeah obviously the big questions around 5g smartphones is around battery life you know how much extra extra battery drain is the 5 g moe I'm going to make on the device and what how that is going to impact performance okay and what's your what's your view on that I mean do you think it's it's do you think that the battery capabilities have have advanced enough for for this not to be something that would put off you know consumers from from buying these devices well actually probably I think the main issue with this or probably one of the main thing that's going to help manufacturers has been the leaps and bounds have been made in the past two years in particular in AI algorithms on devices because one of the main uses that manufacturers have used a I have been in is has been in power optimization headings extending battery life it's something that Huawei in particular has put a very very strong focus on with its Karen 980 chipsets with inbuilt neural engine and it's been something that has been a lot of focus on so that's to me something that even if the 5g modems are a significant power drain that the manufactures that are in a much much better place be able to manage that okay drain and to actively manage the radio when it's on when it's off in a much much more intelligent manner than they wore 10 years ago 4.4 G devices first came to market ok really interesting and in terms of 5 T devices also a question that a lot of people will be asking I'm sure is you know when will when might Apple have a 5g device in the market what's your expectation now we're definitely not in 2019 but that's the first thing to say whether it's 20 20 or 22 21 probably a bit more up in the air Mylene ii would be Taurus 2020 okay Apple has always been a little bit slower and it comes to pushing new technologies into their into their phones it kind of wants to get things not just at the right cost point for itself but also to have a very good and very high level of experience with it so for Apple in terms of deploying 4G or in this case applying three 5g into their handsets the main thing is looking for is it wants to have very well developed networks it wants to have some subscribe subscriptions you know that will have 5g at a rate you know fairly common level so that when they advertise a 5g phone someone's gonna be able to pick it up turn it on and immediately see a difference whereas if you buy a 5g phone in the next six months odds are you are not going to have a 5g quality exactly for 99% of your time yeah so that's kind of the expectation gap that Apple is trying to not have to deal with and it's up to this point in its life it's air or in the iPhone lifecycle Apple's been by far and away the brand leader the premium leader the experience theater that had it has had that comfort to be able to do that and it hasn't affected sales yeah of course sales of iPhones have taken a bit of a hit recently with everything's happened in China but even with that that premium answered market has topped out anyway so Apple is probably going to be under a lot more pressure now than it has been previously to kind of be in step with the market enough for behind what everyone else is doing which is why very much I mean towards 2020 more than 2021 for when we'll see there 5g on iPhone okay interesting and although you know 5g will dominate and the big excitement I'm sure will be around the early 5g handsets what else are you expecting to hear people talking about in terms of devices in at MWC the other big thing that we're going to see a lot of people talk about and a lot of devices showing off at MWC is with foldable displays it's been something that has been rumored and in the works for years now at this point and we're finally getting to see devices coming to market at MWC with that we're going to see probably show me and Samsung at the very least probably Huawei as well with fight with foldable displays and probably more device makers as well the key issue here though is to me is not do these advise devices exist it's can they make the software and the user experience mesh well and can they make you know actual beneficial use of the foldable display to Bill's new experiences because that's always been the biggest struggle for so many of the Android manufacturers Samsung in particular when they've had new hardware technologies it's they are fantastic engineering companies but when it comes to building something that integrates that into a user experience they fall behind particularly it does Apple strengths right in terms of integrating that user experience so that's the big thing I want to see is how is the user experience using the foldable screen to its benefit okay excellent well sounds like there's going to be plenty to keep you busy in Barcelona there for a full week and look forward to seeing you know what you take away from the show Daniel thank you very much thank you [Music]", "sc1qlN6uAIE": "the answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good and today we're gonna be life yaks into one piece chapter 957 let's go now I heard from the people who read the spoilers that this chapter is better than chapter 956 which is a pretty hard thing the top but this is good and we're talking about so let's get in it oh there's also one piece chapter 950 6.99 go check that out too so the chapter is called ultimate I like that I like that was oh okay so we got that's not called the cover page but the weekly shonen jump cover Luffy and chopper Nami Nami Scott at Matthew he's got some candy and top hat well I guess they all got like this weird candy thing but we got another cover page thing there's loot biani goose gets called pick up your speed and all the straw hats are on it it's like this goose rollercoaster ride with the turtle and a turtle on top of that turtle next to them so I guess that was the cover page oh we're back at Marion HQ so I was thinking it was gonna be like act 2 where we just went right back to uh oh I know after um 925 we went to Blackbeard and all that stuff but then we went straight back to one oh but apparently we're still in the marina HQ let's go oh you must be satisfied if soul food or I've been waiting for this dude okay so you must be satisfied it so I'm assuming this is the kind knew the abolition of 4/7 warlord system with your goal after all we never saw eye to eye on it but the kings that the world have spoken so it is that Kazuki talking you still think the warlords were necessary despite all the sacrifices we had to make for their sake so this is food you're right now it must it must be because you've never personally suffered under them Oh dispute or a history with the world look Oh food before God bandages so I guess when he was fighting with the revolutionaries he was picking up them scars you know I'll say ok you got scars on me alright some future tours like let's just put our face in the SSG going forward the ballot the power balance of the world will definitely be shaken so who are the SSG oh I can't believe you got scars bro or bandages we all know we already knew we had scars okay has it occurred to that it might change for the worse this is a kind new now apparently Amano bigmar Mankato have formed an alliance and through the doors like say what and they're all like what does this mean the rocks have returned all right cuz big mom kinda weren't the same proves it like big mom and Qaeda Foreman Alliance does this mean that's around oh my goodness Shaz my voice - shut up - shares he says you're not ready for the chapter I know I'm not I'm feeling the hype right now bro I am feeling this like you know I'm saying okay legend can do it shut up stop talking you must read this [ __ ] chapter okay what does this meet the rock-solid return stop talking like there's some kind of legend oh man I'm just right stop talking like there's some kind of legend this is the if this is reality we're facing here for this tapping one we're so busy what a disaster I've got to see Caillou two of the Emperor's allies it just had to be now of all times for the report stated the Alliance is only tentative at this stage has have been any damage done yet but we have no idea what they're planning and we have no countermeasures prepared either truth we know almost nothing about the legendary rocks pirates so they keep they know nothing about the rocks pirates well I thought God took them out so they're feeling like since Big Mama Cano joining up like that's gonna mean that the rocks are gonna come back right now old man broken Dawkins's he fell off if they won't be these the chapter oh man shout out to all the people in the chat but oh my goodness I'm annoyed right now okay hmm big mom cut off the rock big mom and Kato had been fighting like cats and dogs from years no one could have foreseen this very few Marines are familiar with the name rocks nowadays many years ago on the pirate island beehives many significant individuals came together to seek a quick path to unfortunate so I guess they came together and beehive is where Blackbeard it moves now right so black you take over the former territory if the rocks that's pretty late you know I'll say okay that meeting led to the formation of the rocks pirates they weren't violent killing both friend and foe alike oh so they savage its members included white beard big mom Kaito and their youth they were led by their captain rocks white man okay I know that they said white beard was in the rocks I like I wasn't completely sure if that was confirmed or not but light beer within white beard was killing friends and foe alike that don't sound like the white beard I know you know a thing and all that marine guys are like what so we can see young big mom because young Kaito young white beard and then DC some other dudes indeed those three used to say on the same ship and the means are like unbelievable many others who sailed under the rocks also eventually made a name for themselves such as the golden lion she was under the rugs too and God took this man out God took tell a man who lied white beard oh wait beard cheeky big mom the silver axe captain John Inoue shoku so captain John's silver accent otaku I'm not sure we know about those guys maybe they were in a movie or something so choke ooh this is not um what you saying but this is like the under captions known as Wang Zi in Chinese with a real Chinese pirate Lord from the 16th century okay are you serious and how come all of this isn't common knowledge these are the means to San Goku's teaching San Goku well the one reason is that most of the members couldn't stand each other so they down ployed they downplayed their exploits as a group their captain rocks strive to become king of the world they were basically a terrorist group baring their fangs at the world government so wait hold up bro white beard was on a group of this savage okay now I'm starting to think maybe young white beard wasn't the real man he was that marine bird he probably mellowed out and stuff oh so the government covered up their actions which is another reason but back then their name was known throughout the world 38 years ago a fateful incident occurred I don't place no alley on that day the fate of that fateful day this trunk is pirate crew in the world perished on that day the strongest pirate crew in the world bro silver a shitty this silver axe man like bro I'm getting so hyped in God Valley like I'm getting nard to buy but you know I'm saying the final valiant stuff oh you know I said oh my goodness oh I think I got six viewers right now that's crazy okay the incident was big news there and stuff boo evil rampage which sampled all in their wake was finally quote by vice-admiral does my man okay we see a young guard picture he's covered in blood my man garden he'd be taken out he'd taken our crew with white beard cheeky big mom and dad Oh what the heck okay after the incident garbs name rev okay and people are still saying guard present you live or pirate can level at least prime carbon I mean like they're still saying front guard a pirate king of laughter okay after the incident garbage name rev reverberated across the world that house in that is how he became known as hero of the Marines well I can see why you know okay so that's what happened Vice Admiral guard has many acts of heroism under his belt however he doesn't like talking about this one in it particular huh why he'll acknowledge it if you ask him about it Big Mama uh I went back page although that was oh wait man okay wait okay held knowledge if you ask him big mom and Kato things keep going from bats worst the biggest reason is why he allied with the pirate during that battle although that was never reported okay props yeah I must say the pirate yeah led with was Roger you know what I'm saying better be a bit um better be a Roger a pirate there was another reason though he had to protect their celestial dragons during that mesh ha the celestial dragons were involved well isn't it our duty as a murder it's not to be as Marines to serve the celestial dragons a sense of morality never allowed him to believe that the main reason God always rejected the titles Amaral is because it would have made him a direct subordinate of the celestial dragons oh it's not make sense because I remember GARP was saying things like he was saying things like I don't want to be a Vice Admiral because then it has to do paperwork but that was the real reason apparently his popularity and achievements are probably the only reason why they did it haven't disposed of him for his attitude so I was thinking this D'Alessio guys might want to kill him GARP and Roger and couch dude each other on the island and teamed up to defeat the rock pirates so I was right it was Roger my man okay all in order to protect the select you dragons and their slaved during what is now known as the god Valli incident he fought alongside the Pirate King what a rogue all the celestial dragons Roger and the rocks what exactly was on the island I've never even heard of the place the island of God Valley is no longer drawn on the maps twirled the truth of the matter is after that incident guard Valley disappeared without a trace an island that the world government wanted tide wiped from the history books do you really want to know more about an island like that rocks ambition to become king of the world meant he was involved with many of this worst Abreu subjects that's why there isn't much information on the rocks anymore however I am sure about those memories are lying dormant in the minds of veteran Marines even though it's all in the past it still seems unbelievable that there was a man capable of leading three of the four emperors he was probably Rogers first and four he was probably Rogers first and most formidable rival so that's like more formidable than white beard yo what's going on even he may have been known throughout the ages as the ask captain rocks but his true name was rocks the Xebec so we know the rocks mean we know the rocks name we know the rods captain's name rocks the exhibit he may no longer be amongst us but he is one of the view with the initial D who have appeared from time to time while it's true that Big Momma Kaito were part of the crew in the past they are now much stronger than they were thirty eight years ago if they have truly formed an alliance then it may lead to the formation of the worst pirate crew in the world brand new what are their current bounties no they're not they're not gonna reveal the valleys they're not just working on updating bounties of those who have been stripped of the world Lord status so be male revue they sounding that well the first man who became an emperor one year ago black beard as a result of his attack on improve down he was able to recruit very powerful subordinates it's the current ruler of pirates Island behind his influence is continually spending and he's slowly overtaking white beard as a force to be reckoned with the Amaral of the black be pirates marshals eat each bounty toothed billion for two hundred forty seven million six hundred millions we knew that the next no no they're not they're not revealing that piece they're not they're not member we should discuss is this man he was recognized as a number six years ago and it's the youngest of the four his subordinates trust him greatly his executives are all big names that Beckman no they're not they're not really only tanks bound II don't don't think me focusing hi it's my wish a monkey would be four billion I'm about the diagram no crew are you are you serious so I guessed his bouncer would be four billion so it's 4 billion 48 million nine hundred thousand or nine hundred or four million sorry for 48 thousand nine hundred oh man I sounded I'm shrinking like a little girl oh my goodness okay we're on we have the natural-born sister where we said to have lifestyle a village or the island of Chinese el bass when she was a mere child freezing to trust anyone other than her own bloodline she founded the country of cuddlin running that ruling over it with her 85 children she's queen of the kingdom of sweets for Billy 318 million belly Big Mama Charlotte Leland oh I'm gonna die out get up shook kylos necks cutting that boys and last but not least Kaito parently does have to forget about me the last but not least this man although she was only up interpret only an apprentice when you switch rocks hard he was able to rally ready infamous Marines do his banner pirates not Marines thanks she was sheer strength and became an eye friend across Kaito the governor-general of the be spires please don't be far million stinkin hundred eleven million what I said for many billion six hundred eleven million one hundred or something let's go back to big mom cuz I think I screwed up about the four billion three hundred eighty eight million how depressing I'm sweating oh my goodness I avoiding I'm going to die here I am going to die take a chill pill don't die like I legit strain my chest from this like my chest is legit straight now huh I am alleged sweating on so hot like haha my is like laser point how depressing from here on out it's no longer you seven lower words I said weapon against the effort for course we'll have to see how the SSG from special marine science Marine Force performs before we can determine whether a move of the poison former ranks with wise children under Laden relative these were the bounties are the legends of the previous era I predict about it why baseball team predicted why big bounty would be 700 million but I mean 7 million but I mean 7 billion but in five billion if they show Rogers frumpty I swear I swear I will die right now I won't collapse and die and my soul will go to heaven or whatever if they reveal Rogers bounty I swear that I swear I'm gonna die no casting up the Roger pipes what see 5 million 4 million 8 so it helped me my lunch they're gonna Oh oh when they said this chapter was gonna be a gold chapter I didn't expect this dough of a chancer oh it's the best my Gaga of all time no single pirate has ever surpassed the gravities of these two however if Kay don't Big Momma Lyons comes to fruition there are combined LT will exceed them both they're currently in one a country that is unaffiliated with the world government they are fleet Ambrose and Kazuki we're leaving were no alone Oh Satsuki barged in and they're like slid Admiral Texas ooh things like we're leaving one alone we don't have the resources to divert their son gok\u00fb son of course I had no intention of interfering I only wanted to pass my knowledge onto this new generation of Marines even pirates are capable of developing relationships with one another that just have a motive behind them but cannot hope to predict the future when they are anything of the past speaking of which there is a PI Amano that white beard Roger and red hair favorite wait speaking of which there was a pirate in one oh that white beard wait I'm confused he said there was a pirate in the one oh that white beard Roger and red haired Shane's favorite wasn't there you meet Kazuki Odin he used to be a division commander on white bishop he was poached he eventually he was poached by Roger to accompany him on the pirate king sign of voyage this current situation couldn't possibly have had anything to do Oh Dan could it well it doesn't seem like I wanna know who's coming factor for well doesn't it seem like Rana was coming back the Frog those big shots it's a bit too much of a coincidence don't you think ah Kazuki and the chat friends the chapter ends I need more I need more okay so my brain is a craving empty stomach of what I need more information Oda go download it go say that the lowest oh wait no black widows but I was saying that black Ridge bounty is that low probably because of the fact that the only person the the strongest person he's defeated that we know of to justify his bounty as a Marco so if Marco's Brown sees like 1.8 billion and then black bear defeat and he's the strongest person Blackbeard has to feed it and then just for you black bear be miyako you stuffed it would be a little bit over Marcos so that's probably wise Brown T is that big but or that low all my goodness I got a headache bro I gave myself a stinking headache that Chavez goat best chapter of one piece ever more golden more golden gear for revealed more golden gear 2 and gear 3 revealed more goat sin kaido's devil fruit revealed more goat than anything reveal more goats than anything I know I'm a fourth you know kid got nothing better to do than have a stinking heart attack over a chapter but this chapter was too much like I can barely see from the holy light emanating from this computer screen go to ah I'm gonna die I'm gonna die is there anyone in the chat he wants to come up in the stream and discuss it for just a couple minutes you don't gotta if nobody wants to that's cool I can end the stream on such a good note as this but if any of y'all wanna come up in a stream I'm cool with that I'd like that so any of those want to be on this saying the chat I'll give you a couple minutes while I just try and get my act together from it's amazing laughter okay Susie boys let's keep popping I'm gonna give I'm gonna give this man the link and z-boy finna pop in here and and we and we gonna have some fun discussed in this chapter um uh like broke the chapter was like compared to the other chapters this chapter was like filet mignon and the other chapters are McNuggets okay you know what I'm saying like I have given myself a headache from this you know I'm saying like a legit headache I'm sweating like a pig I am sweating like a pig I just want to confirm if this is for you let me go back on the boundaries bro let me go back up the bounties I feel like I just ran a 10k you know I'll say I feel like I just fainted thinking okay let's go back Oh shakes has to Louis brownie of the yonk oh that like not Louis but like you know I'm saying a black Beard's the whole Marco thing the whole Marco thing with Blackbeard like how Marco's the strongest person he defeated so that'd be wise bouncy solo so shanks has the lowest bounty of like Diaco four billion 48 nine hundred forty billion 48 million nine hundred thousand nine hundred million nine hundred thousand yeah being moms 4 billion 388 million million yeah four billion six hundred eleven million 100,000 white Fiat 546 million goal the stinkin Roger five billion five hundred sixty-four million eight hundred thousand and we got the boy I've been here yeah there's not a tear that there's another ten Thanks big about the title belty Blackbeard baozi fraud bounty we all ready for Roger bounty wipe your bounty the name of the rocks captain like I'm hyperventilating up in here you know I'll say this chat is ghost Iceman this chapter is but I think in this hiked over this chapter is understandable oh yeah yeah I'm there okay do you what do you think so the thing is the yonk about some kind of what I expected I thought shanks Panther would be four billion because um and then pink mama kados would be it was worth it was right I know but I was saying I thought his thoughts would be the highest because of what that paper said with that like newspaper hinted but guess what he actually has the lowest precise Blackbeard yeah I was the only thing I was hoping for with a mihawk bounty reveal you know saying oh yeah I know people in be Diego the de shanks fanboys are salty right now you know that's my honestly those shanks you know I said he was like yong-chol less time to them right and you know Plus as well big mom she big mama Calder known you know they're more commonly to like go around the cause destruction that shanks this but I also increases their bounty that you remember kid he had a bounty part partly because you know he calls chaos civilian and yeah like how strong how strong was rocks to have three onco rhythm to you up in there too bro cannon well we knew she was cannon because the thing is we knew she was cannon it's just that none of the things that happened in the movies he was in we came in so like shaky cuz remember one piece chapter zero or episodes you know that's cannon so the black nation is bought both from GARP and San Goku and destroyed half of marineford is cannon and the fact that he was impelled down and escaped that's okay because that was from chapter zero but then everything else isn't right and the Battle of Ed war is also can but like grow like shake it you watch cheeky white beard Gartner carts are shaky white being a blurb was high noon yeah wipe your big mom card oh then you got Garth and Roger teaming up to defeat the rocks this rocks the exotic like this man bottle you Beast I also wanna people in the crew free that I'm thank you freezing I gotta go is that you froze by the way what you now you froze oh well I said I say plus one of the people from the crew was from being aborted people from the crew was from gorillas part right but what was his name which one of him was because I figured it was because the ones who were saying like the silver axe and stuff like I knew that we were probably supposed to know those guys but I couldn't remember who they was not not all of them I'm pretty sure looking up real quick I'm precious to one second second yeah the name second the Sheik am pretty sure he was from three other bar oh yeah I I can see I think well oh well it's just from oxidize I'm not seeing it just try looking up all cuz one of them I know Dilek works when I'd be alive they were naming off vehicle bounties I was so scared like I was about to die then when they said Roger when they said white beard I said I know they've been a not named Rogers stinking bounty you know I know what it was surprising because what I thought it was gonna do I thought it was just gonna name off the light the Warlord's unfroze bounties but then there's like do not see he's like I'm like Oh brownie I know like brah I was gonna die you knows it oh man this josh was crazy and I feel like I'm like just in my normal day-to-day life I'm usually not like this vibrant but I feel like there's just some people who saw me they just see me losing my mind over this to feel like what is wrong this kid taken to like those a psychiatrist or something oh I so God just like take a breath and just like okay so the UM guys for Golden Lion silver axe Captain John and otaku okay yo yeah yeah man I've just seen if I can find one of them yo you did yeah I'm back oh yeah yeah yeah I'm just seeing if I can find my come on what's a strain everybody let's train with it yeah there are two people left though but so the guy was Captain John the guy on thriller bark he was Captain John right so that guy like I feel like that this is the thing that going it does like these insignificant zombies on thriller bark will come back to be people who are on the same crew with white beard Kaido big mom she keep it you know I'm saying yes I would oh oh no will do like odo will have like of course act to all that setup Oda will have those like crazy boring chapters like that set up like ten chapters of setup but then you pulls things like this and you're just like okay it's all forgiven it's all forgiven just let me you know I'm saying yeah you made sure to land a lot chat was on for this thing right yeah okay I was in the chat yeah okay so it could be too though that a Big Mama Kyle and white bear just simply weren't as strong back then you know it could be true just wanted by second while I switch this hat but the day I got a question of is is why beer a lot more ruthless / evil than we think he was or or was Kyle and big mom not a bad back then because they said the rocks killed friend and foe alike oh yeah that's true in Mankato and shiki would do that's not something we really know the white beard we saw marineford what I'm saying it's like as I was I hold on like he's a party a crew like cuz it's what we be more of a savage back then you know I say right I calm down I'm not an insane psycho one-piece fan anymore I'm just the chill yo you just had a 5-1 piece uh dis chapter reaction I could not contain myself like I know some people might say he was just hyping himself up for the chapter but I like I thought she was playing a little bit cuz like there's no way you did height no I think I was height but I ain't do that bro I was like what the thing is me like usually I would I would get this type I may not scream as much what you really would hear like that like it's I just get extremely probably abnormally high over crazy one beauty chapters but yeah I kind of gotta do some stuff so I'm gonna have to cut the discussion here I just wanted a little bit of aftermath so people so we could just like you know chill out a bit and talk about it but I got some duties I gotta do so I'm gonna have to dip now butter but yeah great discussion stand out no a hundred out of ten chapter and yeah i'ma head out now see you in the next video peace and go to We Trust go let's do", "AZLbj5n01kE": "you live was poppin guys and my fans Wampus answer that question one piece one pieces was good okay yes we got that out of the way so we got one piece chapter 960 live reaction you know the weekly streams and all at that so uh let's just stop into this so 960 is called Kazuki Oden takes the stage and mm-hmm that's that's pretty good because I hope we actually get to see what olden looks like cuz I was talking to some of the boys on this cord and one of them said anyone wanna discuss the chapter with me and he de never discussed his chapters unless they at least remotely fired and yes you all know I'm talking about Zeebo we on earth us up okay so let's the end of this Kazuki Odin takes the stage ah so cover page still gain pages on my family the grand search for Lola first I thought those were all Karma's but no it's just people okay so let's get into this one piece greatness so okay so starting off the chapter I'm telling the truth I swear it I saw with my own two eyes the mountain was moving the mountain moved indeed we fled from it and ended up here it was even growling so I'm just gonna assume right away that they're talking about the numbers of onegai shima just right off the bat because if the mountains moving and rallying I don't know what else I could be but the numbers you know doesn't oh he saw what the numbers look like then maybe my theory about them being ancient Giants could be true you know what I'm saying so um let's get into this okay so through draw row Mountain Pass tea house poster girl okay so we got in character she said perhaps you encountered a mountain god the three of you seem quite chipper considering the circumstances huh the head nothing gets past you won't suru oh oh I think this is another flashback because this should be a flashback because they call her oh suru and she looking young right now I was thinking like Sousou dusty so this gotta be a flag back can you keep a secret for us the truth is we were finally able to capture an elusive creature it took us a whole year take a look at it wow what a beautiful boy skin is Snow White so it's Snow White so basically we got this weird-lookin pig up in here okay so if we take this little guy to the capital we can trade him in for one whole piece of gold and then I was like huh a piece of white gold Oh said a one whole piece of white gold and then those who was like a piece of white gold you could buy a giant mansion with that kind of money so we're kind of getting the look into the wah no currency because like one piece just the standard currency his belly but since wanna was the clothes country and it stand the reason they have a different type of currency that's just logical um so we got boss coral kama has been saying for years but he wants a rare white boar probably did this play outside the store he put a bounty on it but nobody's been able to capture until now that would be quite distasteful white boards are considered the heralds of gods ha ha ha cute story and all but this is just an exotic animal oh maybe it's supposed to be the herald of Cairo I bet I've done no sewers like hang on a moment is that oh dang my man is looking oh so soon was like hang on a moment and then she body slams kinam on it she's like did you just steal money from my wallet again kid Amman and he's like oh I'll stop at us through think of our childhood friendship so oh this definitely is a flashback now he's all blond and stuff what's happening Oh what what was happening I'm confused let me just respond to the chat real quick so let's just get back into this um I then like my big brosman have money issues and she's like your big bro z-- I bet they gambled their money away how many times have I loaned you money now I bet she's like if you ever touch my money again I will rip out your organs and sell them to reclaim your debt okay so basically just seems like Oh Sulu is Nami just wanna Nami except she kind of looks like Robyn more than on me cuz other Conda has two styles of drawn girls the Nami style in the robbing style so uh I guess she's just the robin style cuz like the robin styles he got all via robin monet and now apparently low suit and then she's like if you cannot afford to pay me back then i was strip you of all your belonging this prepayment and then the other guys in the bar like oh thanks for the meal zero the money is on the table because they're not trying to rip her off oh wait so this is the flashbacks hope we got to see Odin and then oh is that Oh Kinnaman is a Yakuza series like you jerk I remember you from earlier and Kinnaman it's like wah ha ha so I think the guy who was at the bar at Ken Amon just took him out and Ken Imams like you should be careful when you talk in public of course I would overhear you this boards worth one piece of white gold right right luck has finally turned around so kid Amon just kind of he just slid up on some dudes and took their money because he's that kind of so he apparently has changed love what kind of guy was Odin and then Ken moans like once I hand this over to boss crow , I will become and then hand her over your clothes your money - oh so he's just stealing over he's just stealing them then we're in the capital now so some guys like um regarding Lord Odin he really does lack the aptitude for sailing today was 230 attempts to illegally leave the country and the fact that he's still alive is surprising and then he really whoa we saw Odin's dad we see Odin's pops okay so he really has left quite the eventful life even as a baby when he was less than a year old he managed to fling his wet nurse across the room okay standard one-piece V&S but age still he was able to catch rabbits with his bare hands by age four he was able to throw a large boar at a bear crushing it to death what is this guy half troll by eighty six he was wrong okay I'm not gonna read that sentence no anyone who reads to chapter you know it's love but that's just creepy by AJ he was getting drunk and starting fights with gamblers by age nine even the Yakuza blacklisted him and banned him from entering their casino so why would the Shogun let his son be going to casinos just entering the chat once again so why would the show can be letting his prestigious son be going to casinos one piece can be weird like that okay and then he retaliated by senator Kinsey no umpire practically started a war with them and culminated when he was captured I aged then after he nearly killed someone so basically you're saying that this ten-year-old Odin or nine and ten she was fighting the Yakuza by himself and he was ten or nine so huh so the Odin being Admiral level really isn't that far-fetched like some people are saying yong-chol level but I don't know it's kinda Janka level is a bit Yucko level isn't that you know a bit much because we already got bullet supposedly being Janka level I haven't seen Stampede so please don't spoil me I'm actually gonna be seen in the Stampede in four days and I will make a review on that and then he was sentenced to hard labor in the stone quarry but he showed off more if it's unique talents he climbed the ranks at the quarry until he was running the place he is truly a member for the Kazuki family so it's cool that we got to see the former Shogun of wanna know before Orochi but after that his attitude just changed significantly when he was fourteen years old the capital was experiencing a prolonged drought the walls had dried up and countless people were suffering so he diverted to River straight to the capital but that only led to the capital getting flooded so his capture was ordered good heart but a fail good heart but fail so I got Morris but throated he's trying to get the water to the people uh-oh captain Balan is in the chat if y'all ain't checked out back captain Valentia you really should he's got some good stuff his chapter streams are also great he's does gaming - he's got some apex luggage and stuff but if you haven't checked their captain ballon you really should so however Lord Odin just followed the water route and attempted to escape out to sea but in the end the voyage was short-lived I'm just gonna probably cut off the commentary just a little bit just a little bit so we can get through this greatness than at age 15 while it was hiding he couldn't job in the deep temple mountains he's hiding and he's the Shogun's son what a character every night he would I like to keep this channel relatively PG so I'm gonna skip that but that's just messed up Odin I think the respect I have for Odin just went down just a little oh it is just uh Oh older man so oh oh that's better um so the work of the devil even though the girls technically chose to stay of their own free will their loves super mage their parents spouses are more powerful safer I attempted to rescue them but Lord Odin stood his ground an eagle early took them all on betterment became known as should I actually say that word because this is PG and that just has some bad it's sin you Asians okay I'm just gonna say the hacker football oh okay okay even though the he'll grow family got dragged into the fray after failing to prevent the fighting so the hill girl family we know he'll grow the flowers a very powerful dog who's off and you gotta respect him he's been teaching the veeraiah so we know how rogue steel Goro and his phone was probably like first name level okay so Lord Odin's victims in number in the and then his dad sukiyaki is just like that is quite enough of course Lord Odin is 18 now and he stowed cross his trouble on the daily basis do not say another word just deliver this to Odin for me this is the day you finally get caught he went that way captrick in amman soaked in amman is running and he's blond i still can't get over the fact he's like blonde and then kid amongst like hello it on a second I was just trying to cash in a bow a knee and they're like stop lying you swindler cuz he just slit up on some dudes and took their pig I'm not lying just let me go to croco my family mansion and then Kinnaman oh that kid stole our money catch him and Flay him alive I would normally say but in a one-time fight none if you would stand a chance so he'll grow if they're doing his thing and he's like catch him and Flay him alive is what I'd say for stealing their money he's like but yet I'll lose to kill him on cuz kinam on we know current kin amant and he's kind of getting out of his prime but in his prime Kinema is gonna be a very very powerful individual because we know Fox tracking him on the dude can cut fire so that's that's some good stuff right that he's like the opposite of Brooke because no Brooke he's got the cold winds of the underworld aka ice swordsmanship and then you got kin amar with fire swordsmanship you got Earl you gotta love one piece with just all these even the wacky drawings of all man you just gotta love one piece oh I got four people currently watching right now that's pretty good nice okay so and then here was like ah haha you must be joking we will bring him in right now is a subordinate said that not you girl and then you bought the wrong pot the big ones are worth 16 pieces of silver though yeah but I can trade this pot back in thirty pieces of silver right sure no problem and then if you want to add another extra thirty pieces of silver I spent when I bought this pot to the value of the trading it in now it should be worth sixty pieces of silver so I should be able to get a big one oh I kind of know what's going on I suppose you all right here you go please come again hehehe who's that oh we just saw Dan Jiro brah okay so dentro was kind of a dentro was kind of an enigma like I don't think we've seen general yet I think this the first time we've seen dentro in the flashback now that we've seen dentro I got Oakland co-ed and so like I know um more moody in the chat he's my guy um but I know he said in the chat he was disappointed with this chapter I can see why one would be at least so far but this danger overview about like now that we've been seeing in danger oh I respect this chapter this chapter isn't necessarily gonna but it's it's not loaning you know what I said okay okay okay okay this can be a winner for this part mm-hmm a typical order okay so hey hey the brat got a discount just like that what a gullible store owner so dandro just kind of swindled the store owner with words hey judge Errol and dangerous like huh and then the store guys like how did I only end up with thirty pieces of silver yes so we do get to see Odin that's actually that's actually a bit lame moon-like I really want to see Odin but you know all these things he's just been being shadowed out and then suddenly I figured alike would see Odin on in a flashback when it's like an epic part of said flashback okay so the flower capitals crematorium chest MRI please do something about him grandpa cards ooh oh oh hey stop crying I know this is all for a funeral but regardless what is the matter refresher for those who have forgotten Odin is a type of Japanese food okay so I forgot that after cremation we were going to collect the ashes but then we'll just look over there he's using the fire that burns father's body to boil some Oden boiling Oden Lord oh it in and then oh it's like this is really nice this stuff oh I do not understand what you're saying but get off my father this is an insult to his memory okay so Odin is kinda just a jerk I think we can take that Odin is cooking food over the fire over a fire that just cremated somebody's Papa like somebody's Papa's just got cremated and he's using the fire to boil himself some food that's pretty messed up so I'm starting to understand why people are saying Odin was horrible and then he kind of mellowed out and became better and then heir to the Shogun Etowah no cuz who killed him and then Odin's just like gulp he's just drinking some beer and eating the Odin and then he's just just chomping it down and slurping and all that and then he's like see ya the next time we drink together cats whoa it will be in the afterlife oh I get it so cats whoaaaa is his friend and then Otis like now then my condolences to the family my apologies he's not one for detailed explanations so I get it now the guy who died was Odin's man he was Odin's friend and then Odin Odin was kind of like I kind of want to have one last drink with you and he did it by eating and drinking over the fire that cremated him interesting interesting choice of remembering someone and then he's like my condolences to the family and then his guy when if his vassals I guess it's like sorry he's not one for detailed explanations and then they're like huh is that how it is what is with that guy he's so cool this means trouble hide your wives and daughters so this is to charming Odin from the rumors and then the bye just right now and there's just a skeleton there did you guys come to capture me yes well I did end up being bribed but you should not talk about such things out loud you idiot so I think Odin's with Angier oh no he's not anyway what is going on here Doan is avoiding me like they usually do the fire Bell has been ringing nonstop there seems to be no firing nearby hey is it a big fire it's a bigger than a mur fire in Odin's like what how can you not know about I'm kind of confused who's who and who's where I'm taking competing how could he not know about the Kinnaman you should have never brought that with you huh you mean the whiteboard oh so kid mom brought the white boy boss Crow comma probably wanted to use it to crusty old girl family what do you mean danger Oh soaked in Amana Gendron talking like I said earlier wherever that little boar goes its parent is not far behind according to the ancient texts a full-grown white boar is the size of a mountain men you refer to them as mountain gods it is said that a hundred years ago a whole region was annihilated in a single night I thought that was just a fairy tale but if this white boy is here now then that means oh oh man I think people are yelling I'm now anger at a real mountain God we're gonna be in a life there already many victims back with the capital so I'm not seeing this mountain for they're talking about and then we see the eye of the mountain board he's like boink boink and even stuff and then I was right it really showed up oh crap will I be responsible for the destruction of the capital that's an interesting story over here I may not know eating but Kisuke Odin I want you to give me that board so dihn's about to kill the boar and we didn't really get to see the boar we only saw its eyes but that would be the end of the chapter so I'm kind of understanding what my moody was saying when he said I was disappointed with the chapter the general reveal in the Odin would face it reveal were great but this is kind of like an whole cake island when big moms up when big moms pass was revealed you know what I'm saying big mom's pass was revealed and we're all kind of like um this is cool but some of us probably wanted to get back to the movie versus big mom stuff you know what I'm saying I feel like that's kind of what it is right here we're gonna get kind of elongated flashback on Odin so we know who olden actually was who he was before he died and then we'll be getting into the actual story so Ivan see young bender oh we got to see on Odin and yeah I noticed Odin kind of seems like Rizzo he kind of looks like rhizome I don't know what that's gonna be but now we're seeing dead row and at in amman are meeting up with Odin so yeah that's basically it for this video um like if you enjoyed the chapter live reaction I enjoy doing these stuff you know what I'm saying I think it's a lot of fun I find it enjoyable but yeah pop in next week from my next life traffic reaction end I don't know what I'm dragging this out for thanks for watching if you enjoy McCartan and only if you know my content like this video and subscribe

mobile products group at Corvo corvo's a RF semiconductor company based in Greensboro North Carolina we have a broad suite of RF technologies and products and we serve markets like mobile handsets and mobile infrastructure but also defense the narrow space and also low-power wireless IOT markets being here at Mobile World Congress with all this excitement going on fighty feels very real already it is coming very quickly 5g will bring low latency communications and that low latency in the network will enable completely new applications we've seen demonstrations this week augmented reality applications over the cellular network and of course many many applications for autonomous cars and driving in addition to those applications the machine communication technology within 5g will allow massive amounts of machines and sensors and assets cars to be connected as well when you combine that with cloud computing and machine learning you have the power to revolutionize many industries and in fact even create new ones the kind of challenges that the OEMs will face while trying to roll out 5g and include the capability in their products are going to include more frequency bands so in addition to 4G bands some of which will also serve 5g there's new bands coming as well and within those bands higher bandwidth so the spectrum is getting very very crowded beyond that you also have higher power levels because of the complexity and the multiple antennas you have more loss and therefore you need higher power in the handset and finally just the complexity itself I mean there is very little room in today's handsets to do more and so customers are asking us to even even in 4G to try to make it as small as possible to make room for all this new 5g content we have a lot of discussions with customers this week and throughout the year on frequency planning and helping to work with the standards bodies to determine which frequency bands are best suited for 5g and how on earth you can implement all of this complexity into into one piece of hardware when our customers look for an RF supplier to help them architect the next generation 5g systems we believe they find a unique capability in Corvo because we have all the key technologies in-house multiple types of filter technology based on saw or ball technology multiple types of power amplifier technology based on both silicon and gallium arsenide as well as advanced switching and tuning networks and even envelope tracking power management to help keep their overall system running cool and efficient the next 18 months for Corvo is going to be very busy we've got a lot of new products to develop and much much more integration levels combining all different types of filter technologies with power amplifiers switches low-noise amplifiers all into these micro miniature packages and in helping our customers ramp those into high-volume production [Music]", "JNanasA3K9Q": "hey yo bro that's what is nice I think I want it Oh so with the silent type huh I don't appreciate that speak up boy so you want to continue to disrespect me I'll have you know something I own this whole section of town I am sickle-cell Mike boy I would sliced up five dudes with this same sickle at the same time they all came back me and I just sliced them all up because I'm that cold boy you can't handle me man I'm just I'm just too cool Lena's towards me boy you can't you cannot compare I want to escape three squad cars the police at the same time they all had guns and I was able to like get out of there because I'm just that cool yeah so I want that sword and if you don't want to get sliced up you're gonna give it to me [Music] your incessant chatter bothers me huh so my incessant chattering is bothering you how dare you I am sickle cell Mike I'm going to cut you alive now you're making me a boy you better watch it you starting to sound like you a main character you're starting to sound like you a little bit of a main character oh crap I'm out oh man whatever he's thought I'm not gonna go after him", "xFFNa-NeCvc": "anime fans form peace fans what is good they answer that question of course is one piece one piece is what's good and today we're doing this one piece chapter 965 live reaction this series really has come a long way like we just thinking about it 965 chapter 965 how crazy is that and I guess let me just say check out my Sasuke lady of course that was completely irrelevant because that's not even the right manga but you know let's just get into this live reaction so let me pull up the chapter here one piece 965 let us do it so uh it's called the crows umi clan conspiracy so that kind of makes sense because we've seen Orochi he's kind of conspiring against uh tony Yasu and all that so we got the cover page of course getting page on my family basically page beat down on some things it's a pretty nice cover page it's going to stop making a ruckus you only draw attention to us you just kinda see page then you know for the wrecked body of somebody so like i may have missed the other cover page but you know let's just get into this so you got there are four distinct oceans in the world which are divided by a long strip of see even more surprisingly this road actually is actually shaped like a sphere how astounding so you know you just got the right three pirates telling Odin stuff so it says Odin's journey is going swimmingly so I'm assuming I'm just thinking that we're probably gonna get a confrontation with Roger pirates because like that some build-up you know what I'm saying like you got the Roger pirates got the wife your privates and we know old Ernest at some point going to transition to the Roger pirates and ease always going to stay behind with my beard I'm ready either went with Odin and just went back to white beard when Roger died but I kind of doubt that I feel like Jesus probably just gonna stay with white there from the get-go so we'll just see how this pans out I should probably stop talking and you know just get into the stream we get individual reaction you know I'm saying but um you got from a global perspective wanna was tiny where were you born Toki I have no idea I only know that my parents were originally from wha no that's why I want to go there you know what it's just like hmm unfortunately it seems like this ship will ever be will never wait unfortunately it seems unlikely that the ship will ever be able to return to Juan Oh that's what sir I tripped over my words right there but um coqu\u00ed's like that's okay when I feel when I'm with you it feels like I've reached my destination and then Odin's like ha how come and she's like I wonder and Marco was just peeping behind it and he's like oh oh oh like Marco's just kind of like oh and he's kind of well I think good he's like Oh what am i witness II you know I like how we see Marco at marineford and he's so you see we we saw mark wat marineford and he's so serious he's like this great right hand right hand man of white beard he's in control he's like he's smart he knows what he's doing he's got concerned ER control he's leader but right now we're seeing him 30 years ago as this goofy kid who's like looking at like romantic confrontation and being like oh like I just like that cool that's kind of a small discreet go-to move just seeing these characters as kids and seeing how they would have developed from there to the point we originally saw them at like how this Marco transition to the Marco we saw at marineford who's just in control like he would do anything for a white bed he'd do anything for Ace who was he was just a whole versed commander but like at this point he's just like this cabin boy of sorts and it's just kind of fascinating to see this and I hope we see Blackbeard in this so then we see mecha mabushii and um vissa and Joseph who and Avista not be is the I got their names mixed together but he's like I wonder what Lord Odin is up to that's nekomamushi and Pisa is like don't interrupt you tactless cat I'm not go just like oh if Jones is like the same it just could to see these young these the young versions of these characters we respect so much and we seen as older and mature and just powerful people in general so I just think it's really cool thing to see that so then it seems that even white grid has a natural enemy it's the Navy run for it that's white beard ship and Odin's like we should just fight them and Webber is like there are a large organization even if we did sustain a bite while we keep showing up because I guess that's a pretty fair thing to say because I do you got white beard he is a jungle or maybe the Onkel weren't in place at the time but like the rocks pirates had disbanded for a few years he is a powerful man even when he was in the rocks pirates who he was already infamous because the rocks pirates were a bunch of infamous pirate is joining together and white beard said white beard said it was a crew of Captain so these were all already powerful captains in their own right who joined together for a common goal to take over the world but still like one clears a powerful person even if he might not have been as strong as he was in his prime I'm pretty sure this is probably why Petra seen so the fact that even somebody as powerful as this hesitates to just go against the Navy does show you that he's a smart person and just how powerful the Navy is in general so you know like you you just co2 tying these little things together like you just die and all these stuff together and even something as simple at the flashback and that's when you just gotta recognize like this is one of the best manga of all time the best manga of all time in my opinion but ya know I'm talking a little bit too much but you know like it's fun to go in-depth on these things you know what I'm saying so oh and it's like so you mean that this organization is overseeing the entire world unbelievable to think that was even possible you'll understand how things are if you keep traveling you'll be surprised in a way your country is still free and Odin's like what because like you know wha no closed off country that people like Odin thinks of war know as a stack in a country like a country that stifles them but from the perspectives of somebody like white beard it is a free of sorts country because the Navy is not there breathing down on the next as I've said in multiple videos the world government has no jurisdiction over one who is a powerful country in its own right that is its own so in a way white betray him was free and that's just kind of a shock to him because like while Rana was just a stagnant for him but now he's hearing that in a way it's free and that just shows you like things aren't black and white things aren't always a blanket you know like OD just talking these cool things into this so I like me I love this story so let's just keep going so um 20 years ago during the second year of Odin's voyage he's out wha-wha how about tamago combo chikuwa tsukune so these are all food names because like at first I was like tamago what like me talking back to Michael and then for like whoa tamago does mean egg like tamago means egg in the UM just Japanese so like if you're talking about Baron tamago like it's cuz he's got that egg devil through it like where he hatches guys reborn kind of that thing so I first I got a bit confusing like bro like you know what's up it's just Japanese um so wha no way I have a better name in mind it means unrivaled his name will be Kazuki Munoz gay Oh what oh okay so mama nosegay was born on white beard ship mama no oh I did I kind of just assumed that moving Osteen would kind of be born in wanto but he was actually born on white bread chef so that's an interesting piece that's an interesting fact and I guess that does make sense because 20 years ago he's eight years old now that whole thing happened 20 years ago so his name will be Kazuki mama knows gay and all the wiper pirates are like yay and then easels like Lord Odin you are now a notorious outlaw with a bounty in the outside returning to I know what bein lady Toki mo of skis best interest and then oh it's like I have not yet found the answers I seek ease oh and then Toki is like we'll be fine then Yakima mushi is like it's funny that these newspapers never have any news about why no I hope kin is doing well soak in Amman it's just like was o when it country has no means of contact with the outside world information really gets out and that's um inner Oishi so um division leaders since our numbers keep growing how about it I'm thinking of splitting the crew and the five divisions that's great let's do it I agree I leave the second division to you as he says that the Odin in orders like no I would rather not have that kind of responsibility and they're like just do it so we were right the second division commander was Odin and when he left it got covered up like not comfortable it got vacant like it became vacant because the second division commander position when he died was left vacant or actually when he went to a drawing Rogers crew so that makes sense because a lot of people are saying Odin's the second division commander or the formal one and I was kind of like and maybe maybe but apparently it was true so that's cool to see such a small Theory like that come true so over many over time many others would join the crew like we did you don't get it we're not fishermen were pirates understand please I've got nowhere else to go what's your name teach dude so we seen teach join the crew so yeah so we know teach join the crew to get his hands on the army I mean only so that just shows to how much of a manipulator he is even from that young age he's like I've got nowhere else to go he's begging white beard to get on his crew he's begging white bear to join his crew he's acting like she wants to be a part of the crew but in reality he's actually just going after the devil fruit who thinks it will get a white beard ship which it did that is so she's such a schemer even from a young age it is crazy like bra so this is just really cool seeing T's do all this and wow it's been 11 minutes and we're already only six pages and Wow but it's like teachers like I've got nowhere else to go and then Odin's like there was another orphan and then white peers like fine then jump on the more I see during our travel is tomorrow realize did you see that there was something flying over there wait commander Witcher scout things out first and Odin just running off just as usual boisterous as I've reported as ever he's like I'm just realizing how much there is to see I can no longer contain my adventurous spirit now meanwhile Amano Lord sukiyaki altered I'm you'll have gathered in the flower capital or sorry no Lord sukiyaki and then it says all the time you have gathered in the flower capital shogun sukiyaki is in critical condition I want Orden to succeed me as the next show it again of course Lord sukiyaki however Odin is away at the moment if something were to happen to me before he returns I feel I must point a point at an acting region to take care of things until it's returned I have chosen to a point that man that Odin regards as a younger brother Kurumi Orochi what huh oh it in regards I wrote she as a little brother I feel okay so that must be some manipulating done on a road she's part because like I'm pretty sure that's not what happened um then Tony arias who was like Orochi why is he here that man that Odin regards as a younger brother so like um what's his face sorry Tony ah sue knows that that's he knows that's a lie no she's like I cannot adequately express how grateful I am to Lord sukiyaki and Lord Odin I may not ever be able to repay my debt during this lifetime I promise you disappoint opportunity to redeem the crows in the clan I will atone for my grandfather's foolish and I will help out in any way I can I hope to have everything fully prepared for the Lord Odin's eventual homecoming so you just see Orochi he's much younger he still looks like a beaver but you know that should help be sometimes beaver Orochi and now he's like until it's returned I will serve as a temporary substitute I show no more I shall be no more than a humble figurehead in these bowing it's like please lend me your support and then Tony Oz is like how come you never mentioned you were a curls ooh me and then he's like forgive me and then he's like I am very sorry and you just see shadows on his eyes like he's a big trigger now like he's mad when he says that you can see just a little bit of shade a little bit of anger you know what I'm saying not even a little bit like he's like he's just like I am very sorry so like you know of course he's got wealthier players his plan was to use his Regent position to take over guano and it apparently succeeded and now crackle crackle Rumble so it's raining somewhere I want oh there's thunder and he's like I can see it your future you shall become Shogun so there's this fear this Sears susai Sayer and she's like or is it a heat I think that's a he and he's like you shall become Shogun and I wrote she's like huh and he's like yeah kick kick kick and uh and then I rope she's like whoa you're frightening stop trying to scare me granny so I guess it is girl he's like who are you anyway so some soothsayer some weird soothsayer just went up to him and said you shall be Shogun and this weird granny is like do you not know what happened to your grandfather and then she's like I heard he committed seppuku but I'm sure but I am unsure about the specifics and she's like no that is a lie he was killed by the Kisuke clan but I heard he committed treason since when was since when was struggling to obtain power crying the ones with power ultimately decide what is right and what is wrong what was once considered a crime can be redefined as noble you know that's that's pretty factual like that's true that like the ones with power can kind of turn quote-unquote bad things into good thanks the one who's the strongest just like in any facet of life like even in religion the one who's the strongest it's kind of just the one who decides what is right and what is wrong so like that's that's um that's a big facts um you see the previous Kazuki Shogun did not have any children to succeed him so the five daimyo who served the Kazuki Shogun that started to wonder who the next Shogun would be every single one of them believed themselves to be the best candidate so you got the schmansky clan the Kurama clan the zookie claimed the amat suki clan and the forgets you clan so you see that and then it was then that your grandfather started to make some careful preparations preparations to assassinate the other diamonds with poison his rivals disappeared one by one their absence been explained by an internal dispute the Shogun haven't heard of the demise of his demeo's became bedridden from illness everything was going according to plan he was at the cusp of claiming the country for himself when an heir was born Kazuki sukiyaki and now this weird old hag is like bawling her eyes out like she's bawling and crying so like I guess she's probably got connections to the Kazuma clam maybe she was the grandfather his wife so his grandmother or something but spiteful sukiyaki the cursing MacLaren's plot to take over the country was eventually exposed your grandfather was forced to commit seppuku on top of that the entire clan was disbanded all the tarry territory the castle the power gone everything was taken from the Kurama clan the name itself was scorned by the people their surviving members were left and homeless squalor who was to blame for the pitiful living conditions you find yourself in who was to blame and then a rope she is just trigger now he's really mad like now then he heard the story he knows what actually happened and I guess he thinks that trying to kill people is okay but now he triggered he like the one who was born kurosu me sukiyaki but to be fair his family did get ruined in like he would have been noble nobility and all like I get his family got ruined so that that's just something you kind of be triggered out about like either way and then um he's angry and he's like kazumi or not cursing me sorry Kazuki sukiyaki and the hat is like yes if he had never been born he would be Shogun so he's realizing I would be Shogun if it were not for kur Azumi sukiyaki no I keep doing that sorry he's realizing I would have been Shogun if it weren't for Kazuki sukiyaki so that is I guess that makes sense because like yeah that's who he would have been the right boo Shogun frightful Shogun if it were not for sukiyaki so he's just really mad right now and then he's just thinking of himself as to Shogun and he's like me indeed woo how vexing how spiteful are you perhaps my know the kurosu me clans he's asking her who she is and she's like my identity does not matter she was probably his retainer or the kuru clan pertain er and she's like no just know that I haven't heard many hardships while I was out of the country look at my face huh and then she suddenly shape-shifts her face and then he's like huh my face she just switched her face from an old hag to a beautiful woman to a roach his face oh this is the power of the mana mana no me that's Barclay so that's mr. tooth fruit yo we don't really Kabam clay be from wha no and ate the fruit and wha no because we know that he's like the same type of like crossdresser as YZ oh and o'kiku so if this person who was a retainer of the Carozza me clan or something like that had the mana and mana Nomi a bog plays an orphan in guano and goes and takes it brah but who look at these connections oda is tying the is crazy he has the Mahna Mahna know me and he's like if you follow my instructions I shall grant you the power you need to become Shogunate and then Roach is like I would do anything begin hoarding as much gold as you can and start manufacturing weapons the quality of wando's craftsmanship is exceptional if you make good use of that advantage you will be able to get some big players to back your cause and then in hack my my name is roti my entire family died due to illness and Tony Hawk's was like how tragic you are welcome to work for me and then he's like Orochi disappeared it might be just a coincidence but all of the gold in the safe has gone too so she's showing like Orochi stolen because of what the guy said so I'm Kenneth I'm asked money to take over Wando so it's cool were seen Orochi back story now and then in curry are you the guy from Jaws to his place my name is roti haha Authority actually has been so generous I could not bear asking him to lend me more money and then Odin's like I seen leave it to me and then Odin gave him money and a roast like please I need more money and he's like again please I need more money again I would definitely pay back soon please I need more money and then Odin was about to give him more money and then tendrils like Lord oh it in and then oh it was like he said he'd pay me back soon so Odin this is sudden is something wrong he came without your retainers so this is the flower capital now and then Odin it's like I want to give this guy a job at the castle here he worked very hard and can make medicine he has been like a younger brother to me oh so he actively referred to him as a younger brother because of all the money he was giving him so that's well played by rho0 she just was acting all pitiful gotta notice cuz I totems like he's like my little brother and that just got a Russia a good spot in the palace and then he can kind of whisper in sukiyaki here because this was all his plan so I'm assuming the guy who had the meinem I don't know me probably is going to give it to uh I wrote she not give it to a merchant but give a rope she his double feet his um Yamato nor a real Qi one Suva note is like alright farewell and then the old hag is like me a kick yeah her Nikhil cook he'll I can't really do laughs we're gonna rope she's like I finally made it this far something happens to me I leave everything to you Orochi yes sir Lord sukiyaki and then they're laughing together like Nicky kick again and it's like the hair shortly afterwards use of coconut sukiyaki passing spread throughout wanna one day during the fourth year voters voyage what the heck is going on the fish are going crazy could this be the signal some kind of natural disaster it seems to be coming from that island whitey Chan yeah I wonder if there's some sort of monster over there let's take a look Marco Morocco changing into his Phoenix form no way yo that doesn't sound like fun to me wah-ha-ha-ha you know it is like haha come on Hyori mementos k everything is fine there is no big deal so now he or he has been born by this point and then huh you're kidding even those ferocious beasts are in the way we see John alligators Tigers gorillas elephants they're like what the heck is on that island Roger let's go Roger is on the eyelid and Rogers like next time ring someone's like some coke war garb you lot aren't even worth a buck you said captain Roger what big trip just thought if the island then Raley's life only just finished this fight Roger and Rogers like white beard huh it's been a long time since we last crossed paths crossed paths and shakes it's like are we gonna see how shanks guys scarred shakes vs. black beard bro ABC shakes versus black I'm gonna have a heart attack bro dude this is just let us go so um this is sure gonna be around the island they must have already disembarked Oh Misha shanks he's got Rogers hat on since Rogers doesn't have his hat on right now so shanks s Rogers hat on we see crocus we see a scarf of gabon we see that guy who's unnamed we see a lot of unnamed guys but we just see the Roger Pirates all these powerful dudes Evan Rogers like since our lives are in an endless brawl anyway we might as well just go at it after all I don't have much longer to live this may be the final time we encounter each other white beard huh money the chapter ended bro we're about to see Roger and white beard meet next chapter so redundancy Roger and white beard meet next chapter this is crazy I am so I for the next chapter so let's talk about this real quick so bad this chapter was great 10 no 10 out of 10 let's do that [ __ ] no probably not 10 because 10 out of 10 is something like chapter 957 but 9 out of 10 amazing crafter ton of information super great food super interesting we've seen Roger and wip'd meat and they're about to battle because they know some people might say remember that flashback where we saw them on the island of Sacre's where roger was telling white beard about the um for its century so that might be what this is but remember shanks does not have his scar yet they are going to battle and Blackbeard is going to scar shakes this is probably where shanks get his scar from Blackbeard this is and this is probably where Odin is going to fight Roger and his crew and going to realize how strong he is and gain respect for Roger because he hasn't met Roger yet and this is probably gonna be the pivotal point where Odin goes to join Roger dude see the Roger pirates vs. to wake you guys and we might even get some of the names of the Roger pirates I am so excited like dude I cannot wait til next chapter this is going to be insane this is gonna be insane this is gonna be insane bro yo dude I cannot wait for this like I know I may be chapter 9 out of 10 predictions for next chapter I believe that we are going to you know we're gonna go see shanks get his scar or maybe not the batter will probably be off-screen to be honest but we're just that Roger and like quit our kind of clash and they are going to battle in the next chapter so that's just something cool that's something amazing like this is this is pretty I'd this is pretty nice right white view pirates vs. the Roger pirates even if it's off screen and just like what if we see little shanks and his fresh scar over his eye that she's gonna be awesome dude I am so stinking hyped right now so next chapter is gonna be let expect the live reaction for that because I really want to see what happens next I wanted to see what happens when Roger pirates and - pirates class and just one last thing seen Roger without his hat was kind of cool cuz I'm pretty sure like I've never seen him without a hat before besides his execution I just seen him beat up this marine he had some kind of marine in his hand and the marine was bloody had just completely destroyed the marine and he's like next time send somebody like Sengoku era garbage it was just cool to see that savage side of Roger this marine that he just completely banged on this he just been hammered this marine so it's just a pretty cool thing to see Roger destroy a marine like that you know what I'm saying it was just cool this chapter was amazing as I said 9 out of 10 amazing chapter as I said six is next chapter just a follow-up from this whole thing seen the white beard and Roger pirates to meet up see what their interactions are will probably go to AH know and see what I wrote she's doing see some of the stupid nefarious stuff he's going on so then the various feelings going on over there but yeah great chapter thanks for watching this last few

I will be expanding my channels borders and opening it up to other anime not only will I cut but one piece but some of my other favorite mangas as well that includes seven deadly sins attack on Titan by hero academia black / naruto bro till franchise that's all for now see you soon", "zqFNk3mmxIc": "hey what's up there's something in my throat but anime fans want peace fans let's go me answer that question of course that's one piece one piece is what's good and yeah we just got a one piece chapter 962 live reactions so out let's just get into this the chapter was on break last week so that kind of annoy me so I'm assuming we're just gonna continue with the Odin flashback but I can't be you know be completely sure the chapters called the daimyo and his retainers though so I'm just gonna assume that's what's up I think that's fairly reasonable you know what I'm saying so yeah let's just get it in this chapter so we on the cover page we got the gang pages of my family continuation and they stump that's a bit weird but anybody who's seen the chapter they know what's up so also yeah let's just get into this Solano country how come I what you really are leaving sir Odin will we be free of your trouble but it will no I read that wrong we will be free of your trouble but it will be lonely without you it wouldn't like I heard that there was a beast living in curry a monster by the name of Ashur and og so you know it's up there drop in the name of Oscar and og like we all know she tomorrow I sure don't you but everyone call him he's a beast even though he's not as strong as jack as far as I can tell because we know in a shrine jackpot Jack was already hurt and he was not even in his hybrid form so you kind of just gotta face the fact that those two were fighting equally when Jack was just in his human form so you I think it's safe to say that Jack is stronger than a shrub but that's not to take away from the strength of Ashura at all that's about as strong as Inu and lecco so yeah so oh it is like he's got his eyes on mash radhaji cuz like as we've seen Odin is a very uh what's the word he likes to fight but I don't remember what the word for that is but he's an ardent conflict seeker so like just like when here's the name Astrid OG there's a monster named Asher doji he's gonna want to be fighting him so then uh curry is a cancer Amano even Lord sukiyaki does not touch the place and the person who said that is I just blanked out on his name right Tony gosh so I don't know why blanked out on his name that was stupid but yeah so Tony Yasu is the one talking Odin and he's like hurry the cancer wanna know even Lord sukiyaki doesn't touch the place and then oh it's like Kearney has become a place a haven for criminals I seen this one crossed into curry the laws of the Shogunate are meaningless although if they're not strong enough to survive in Korea then they are only delaying their death sentence Korea is so lawless it might as well not be part of this country enough sorry Tony hasta said that and Odin's like how interesting I think I would take my own tour around the country so like that's I I'm starting to see why like you could tell that Luffy kind of reminded Astra a little bit of Odin because like you know loopy he's just the kind of guy he sees our hard opponent he want to fight that opponent and he wanted to go for the challenging stuff cuz it's all part of the journey for him so you can see Odin got that same mindset so then this is the room he stayed in yeah so we can switch scenes this is doing he stayed and just look at the place how can he make such a mess we demand we should demand compensation well I would rather just pretend the natural disaster passed through Florida ah sweet you are too soft on Odin so sorry yeah sorry not Tony ah see I think I'm getting him mixed up you know what let me just search him tonal y'all suit cuz I think I'm getting them mixed up no yeah yeah he is Tony awesome but it's really beyond me I'm just getting all mixed up right my bad so I guess we could just carry on with this after oh but just before we go my boy mochi has come into the chat and if y'all haven't been checking out the mochi man's channel your lives are a little bit less happy in the one-piece sense them that could be like mochi he'd be packing the heat on his channel you know and I'm saying so he really go check mochi out and no he did not ask me to do that it's just facts okay so for tea ice we you are so soft on Odin the money is gone yes it was locked in the safe but so yes he's like there's the money song so apparently somebody stole the money and then little Orochi is like um I hate to be a snitch but I saw what happened it was Lord Odin he stuffed all the money into a bag and then the servants like I knew it he repaid our hospitality by a grogginess unforgivable and Yasuo is like if Odin was responsible he would have done it in a more spectacular manner and then uh and then uh yes he's like are you certain Orochi so just before I carry on under the chapter I know people are like bruh you talk too much but I just want to say this Orochi like the road shoe we are with now like actually I guess it makes a little bit of sense cuz I was gonna say this is more than twenty years ago so Odin is 18 I believe so I guess this is more like 30 years ago cuz I was gonna say if so if orochi's that young at the time does that mean he's 20 now but I just realize no he's more like 38 so that makes sense and then um gas was like an Easter in a row she hadn't wrote she flinches me it's like hehe yes please forgive me I was just too scared to stop him so you can tell right away I wrote she's the one who stole it like Yasui he knows ou didn't do it and who would do it except for the dirty snake known as Orochi because of her rope she was taking him by Yasui and then he's out here killing the man years later you know he's a snake so like you can bet that I wrote she is the one who took the money so I'm talking way too much like it's been this long how long has this dream been going on for six minutes and I'm only through four pages that's pathetic no but you know we love the discussions here don't we we love the discussions so uh you can see Yas was just like hmm like I know there's something about this so let's just get on the next page so after leaving Haku my sorry Kurt I still got something in my throat just the remnants of in a very annoying cold you know what I'm saying so after leaving Haku my wooden and his followers caused the many incidents on their way to curry how long are you two going to follow me forever oh so what you got Otis so you got Owen he's just trying to go to curry right and he trying to chill and curry and fight some big strong dudes like he's trying to take out a shrah and then you just got kid on my Nintendo they're just following him like he's there like long-lost dad or something and he's like how long are you two gonna follow me and they're like forever cuz they're so obsessed with him and then he's like oh no now I have two annoying fanboys no like he looks disgusted they're like kind of like you know the little sweat thing on the back of anime heads oh no it's like dude like you know what's up so anyway what are you two doing that's your servant we must stand guard come inside already you don't because like a dead 200 and kinam on there just staging outside of the shelter and then oh didn't like he didn't take them in as his servants but they're just like were your servants now and they're just standing out in the rain and he's like come on come inside you don'ts and then they're like what are you doing and Odin's like I have decided to keep a log apparently sailors from the outside world would do the same thing during their voyages and then the captions say and so from then on their exploits were recorded in Odin's logbook and Ringo we encountered two hungry brothers covered in filth dude bro oh so they again encountered two brothers and filth they danced on the streets to get by but the locals treated them scornfully their names are kikunojo and ezel ezel so this is all so of course Kiku is the younger brother but but you know ezel 16 16 16 division commander also white beard pirates so like you know he and Keiko have some similarities I think y'all catch my drift but you know you got this guy right you got they're both they're both crossdressers but that makes sense you know what I'm saying like they look similar I'm telling you that's the same ezel and I think a lot of people when it comes to the same conclusion just like I know with everybody was saying oh Fuji tours from wanna know pretty much from wanna know everybody's from wanna know I never would have thought to say ezel is from mono but that is definitely the same ezel so that makes sense I guess because that actually makes a lot of sense because the way Odin might have gotten on the white-bearded ship it's that easy or no sorry the way that ease oh might have gotten on the white beard ship is that Odin was there and he knew who Odin was and then he was able to get or might be a ship through Odin and yeah that makes a lot of sense and like I guess it makes sense because like he's always did where wanna wash clothes now that I think about it so bro okay okay I'll see you whoa I was not expecting that and I know a lot of people are gonna be like run you get an overhyped it's not a big deal but that's a big deal to me like that's food for thought that's that stood for a power scaler and for theorists you know what I'm saying I'm sure the whole community is basically serious but yeah that's food for the community I tell you so I learned that they were raised in a dancing school but their family was torn apart after their father was arrested and convicted and then Odin you can see him yelling at them eat up you little brats and they're like they starve down the food we made that Odin made them and they were crying tears were streaming down their faces and Odin there were rumors of a highness mountain bandit why do you guys keep following me because Odin's like go away so oh he would fight any man he locked eyes with and kidnap any woman so oh so just going back to the ezel thing for just a second that means that ezel was kind of one of the nice gabbard's before because you can see here and kick who are following Odin around and so here's what I think I think there might have intense gabbard's kind of like we know easily use his guns but diesel was following Odin around and was one of his retainers kind of and then when they went on Whitebeard ship it all makes sense now ezel goes on the ship with Odin oh and leaves to join Roger the ezel says to Odin I'm going to stay with white beard because I love white beard now I consider him my dad that makes oh let's oh so that's just other that's definitely makes a lot of sense ezel is working under Odin they go on white beard Gipp Odin leaves ezel ops to stay so oh that's not the go-to move oh man I don't even know why I'm necessarily so hyped over that but bro bro is just like hold up let me respond to that yeah but that's just the that actually kind of blew my mind because like Otis he won't make these little connections but like even when it happened your mom is still like oh so they're like they scarf down the food out and made them tears were streaming down their face in key B there was a demon that would steal human hair and to not matter whether his victims were dead or alive he turned out to be a weirdo who used the hair to make rushes so he can sell them to make a living and that was kanjuro so you see him just meet balkanize gabbard's so so there's contro seem enough ki b and then he's like he came for my hair so i beat him up yesBut followed me ever since so he came from his hair I wouldn't beat him up and then he just falling out and around and he's like you can see control it was like I thought you were carbs I yield and it seems that he was persecuted in the past so you reap what you sow a new dawn the rumors are behind this mountain bandit why do you guys keep following me he would fight any man he locked eyes with and kidnap any woman it turned out it it was Rizzo a genius ninja who resigned from because uki families owned a woven shoe he was heartbroken after being rejected by a kunoichi so you see him say Lord Odin I'm sick of living and hiding like some hermit so I think it's reasonable to assume that that couldn't wait she is Shinobu I think it's reasonable to assume that kunoichi was indeed Shinobu and rise will be one if the owner wife and shoe doesn't surprise me that makes a lot of sense so uh yeah okay yeah well let me get my head back in the game something just happened so it's a lawless land of curry and then we see a shadow just like Kazuki Odin is coming to curry the Shogun's own blood huh I would love to kill him bring him to me yes sir I hate people with privilege I hate privilege people with power the most then stop up a monster of curry Astrid oh gee so assured oh gee like you know he is going to be very uh he's gonna be power you know what I'm saying he's definitely gonna be powerful because like I want to say is that strong as Jack but because of the thing of Jack not using his I read for him I can't really say that but it being a strong he's in a Russia and a comma mushi is still pretty strong that makes us why he'd be an unstoppable monster I personally think he's like one of the strongest well I know he's one of the strongest of the knife scabbard even when he's doing right now he's pouring he cut off a snake's head and it's pouring the blood of the severed snake body into a bowl and you can just see he's like the leader of a giant gang and then he's got his support and it's he's definitely the marks of curry and then so you see the what the nine scampered starts right now there's six of them you got Kinnaman raizou kanjuro dentro little Kiku and little E's Oh because like as I said he's Oh like I would never have thought that ezel would have been one of the knives guy for guiding I know I keep saying that but it's just so surreal and man that bad lighting my bad maybe I should just tilt the camera a little bit no that's not working yeah I'm just gonna leave it as is so like yeah this isn't working is it whatever I apologize for the lighting that work not real well that's even worse okay let's just leave it out like that sorry for that little uh deviation but where was I right so they're like where's her Odin he said he was going to relieve himself I think he went south I thought he said that yesterday he often disappeared for a day or two on whim right hey wait a second Korea's to the south so that's what genjuro says and they're like what and then in a month like how disgraceful I swear I would die from but I'm late to the battle and then they go running to curry he's like look the front gate is broken and then you're breeding Odin's locks again after I broke the front gate I was overwhelmed by the stench of blood sweat and corpses he has so you are Kazuki Odin I was disowned that is no longer my name as if the entire world had turned it's killing it intent directed towards me the rules there some simple one is free to enter but leaving would mean death and then Odin's like tell your boss that a samurai has come and then he's like how stifling such an environment is unfit for humans never leave that is the kind of rule I hate most so Odin just runs forth and he's fighting them and they're like hurry up look Road Lord Odin there's dust coming from that mountain he must be there sir Odin we are here to help and then he's like they even followed me out here cuz he's trying to get rid of him cuz he doesn't he's kind of like like I guess he likes somebody it's like I don't want no serpents per se and then Odin is like sorry I just finished up here Wow so I was hoping they wouldn't off-screen the fight but so I do want to know that Ashford og he's older now and he's probably not as strong as he once was because he said that kind of monster on as strong as he once was which probably means the same for him so ash sure probably was as strong as Jack in his prime Oh II didn't just so load all of curry like literally every body without the Knights gabbard's including Astra he's just sitting on top of ash was bloody body with his sword on top of ash rod and a bunch of dead or unconscious guys around him and then oh and it's like it took all night I cannot believe it took that long so this is the power of the infamous Ashford og so I think he's saying the fight was Asherah specifically took all night so you do know that I sure is strong I think at least at this point he's definitely the strongest of the nine scabbards I think he I think that he was probably the strongest like just always and Ashura is like hurry up and kill me it was inevitable that my life would end like this I have no regrets and then Odin's like hey you lot do you all still adore me I will be needing your strength of wits I've decided that I want to become the king of these scumbag and they're like yeah we adore you I bet so then it's like huh it was a hellish land filled with the stench of corpses but Odin used his overwhelming right to round up the ruffians of curry and turn that hell into a peaceful and prosperous place for its inhabitants so Odin became the daimyo of curry and completely cleaned up and redirected the whole direction and just stay of the place so that's that's respect and you see Asli smiling and I wrote she is like secretary he's crying almost I know he's not crying he's just like shocked and then they're like he really changed that curry have you heard of his remarkable exploits Shogun Kazuki sukiyaki reversed his decision to disown Odin and then you see um osoo rule is smiling at the papers and then he declared his son Danny oh of curry our very own Lord Odin is going to become Curry's daimyo we did it with this curry will become a proper region and it's hard to believe this is finally happening after all that hard work congratulations sir Odin daimyo yeah and you just see Ashford og he's all like yay what the rest of them cuz they just all adore Odin so much you got you got a Kiku ease rise oh then general Kinnaman and Cointreau and I sure don't yeah I don't know I couldn't think back from doji it's something wrong uh shrah and then asteroids like I well this is the first time I've seen what peace looks like Thank You Odin and then it's like enough with the sappy talk it kicks them in the face that's an Odin thing to do considering what we've seen of Odin so yeah I get that um then Odin's like and then ash result triggered in Odin's like although now that you mention it a diamond required for attainers I would rather not have some uptight officials following me so you guys would do you guys can be my samurai and then just all of them are crying so I don't that means ezel was an official nine scabbard he wasn't an official retainer of Odin he's oh I still can't get over that who would have thought that ezel was a retainer for Odin so I think I have to rethink a lot of things cuz I kind of just wrote he's a wife as not the strongest guy on the block like I know he was wiping sixteenth division commander but he doesn't seem that powerful but now like that ezel is a retainer for Odin I gotta think some things dang okay and they're all crying and then they're like lord Odin and then apparently they're all hugging him and like you can just see a bunch of tears falling out uh out of the castle and Otis like wah get your hands off of me your snot is dripping everywhere and then it's like six years later at 33 years from the present so that was about then 39 years which means that I wrote cheese like 40 in his late forties then so he is old wait so it says then six years later from that the survivors of the legendary rock pirate started recruiting they would eventually become the beacons of power for the next generation so that means titled big mom and white beard wanna countries Beach Korea Beach what are they animals or are they just hairy people weirdo looking monsters perhaps so we're seeing a cow omatsu and he's like how freaky and then it's like who are these figures who have washed ashore so I'm assuming there's somebody having to do with the rocks alright that's a no and echo what am I saying those that's the young that's a young in our Oishi and a young yakumo mushi so i guess they used to be the ten scabbards including easily even though ezel doesn't use a sword he probably did he probably switched the guns when you joined with white beard but I guess Odin had ten retainers that's kind of cool and then we know ease Oh ended up switching the guns or something and he joined with Dwight be a pirate so that's the end Kaster ten out of ten chapter that easel reveal knocked me off my rocker broke that easel reveal the fact that easel the sixteenth division commander swipe your pirates was a retainer for Odin just really does and I know I keep saying that and then it's cool we've seen how all the nine casts scabbard came together the fact that he's always Kiku's order brother that's just too what I thought yeah prediction for next chapter just I guess next chapter probably won't be as good it'll probably just be a uh you know an echo meeting up with the nice cabbage meeting Odin and all that but yeah I'm gonna be signing off for now he's reveal was great I guess not not 10 out of 10 but 9 out of 10 for sure thanks for watching if your normal content and only fingerman content like this video subscribe to notifications for more one piece content I will see you yeah this really isn't gonna work is let's just get the lighting good for once before I leave it's that impossible wow that's worse I will see you in the next video goodbye", "5eQt1dWI1cQ": "I'm a fan Swampy's fans what's good the answer that question of course it's one piece one piece is what's good and I don't know what the audio sounds right now because I was trying to make a video before with face cam but for some reason when I put both the face cam and the microphone into the laptop the audio just comes out horribly I don't know if it's doing that in the stream or not I guess I'll find out after it so if the audio is horrible I apologize for that but yeah so we're gonna be reacting to one piece chapter 959 I can't believe it's been that long since chapter 921 when kaido's power of there was like we were almost hitting the nine sixties boys and after that 979 80s next year we're gonna be hidden to thousands to think about that and about the time span from now that kaido's reveal his devil fruit reveal was we are going to be hating chapter 1000 just like get height for that you know what I'm saying so yeah we're just gonna be yeah live reacting to one piece chapter 959 so let's get it so I've been hearing mixed messages about this chapter I heard that it was made like I heard it was three out of ten in terms of mid Ness right it was very mid or I've also heard that was seven and was a good chapter so nothing outstanding but nothing bad either so it's cold samurai chapter 959 same ride so we got the beige on my family cover page we got entering battle-scarred dress roses so beige and uh chip on or and coming dressed rose trying to find Lola you know what I'm saying and I don't even know why Lola was in dress Rosa but that's pretty that's pretty cool um so we got two days before the final battle in total our forces are four thousand two hundred strong well done everyone so it seems like as I predicted we're going back to what happened before they disappeared so that's a pretty good thing that's pretty good well done everyone we should use this as Kinnaman talking well done everyone we should use the time we have left to prepare and start moving towards rendezvous point we shall meet at the promised port yeah alright let's err we have enough ships ready for 5,000 people that's Frankie yeah they're just going yeah we need to make sure our ships are in a position at the promised time alright you can count on us big bro France Kay and all the Carpenters are like yeah it's like everybody's hype and I wonder what's gonna happen we stop it's like okay we're heisting to a Mikasa village to meet up with the rest of the crew will be aboard their sunny for the final battle alright thanks for the help you two are amazing ships rights of course we are let's crush the B's pirates yeah just typical anime yes you know don't saying okay all around 100 Cho is bringing in the weapons from Ringo gather anything that can be used as armor here I do not know these are usable or sorry I do not know if these are usable but we have plenty of weapons here that are going to be exported so we got cannons like saws like that like things are getting real things are getting real if we assemble too early we will draw unwanted attention on the day of the final battle the Shogun's possession will march from the capital to the port once they depart for onegai shima the capital will commence celebrations of the fire festival no one will pay us any mind the pair of birds who indicate that we will assemble before sunset but some government officials will still remain on the mainland we should proceed with caution so they have no reason to alert onigashima or onegai shima I don't I don't know what to call it so we're at curry the pair are no that's the same page curry and Mikasa village can we really wear these of course look at this carpet Oh Armour awesome I want to show this off the new table as soon as possible this armors for true warriors yo-ho-ho and then Luffy's got a samurai out there yo samurai loopy looks clean I'm not gonna trip he looks clean even if he can't use armor or swords and meat just messing around and carrot and chompers got Oh chompers got samurai armor too he looks so intimidating I didn't know chopper could look intimidating I'll be honest I did not know chopper could look intimidating he looks more intimidating than movie choppers looks just looks so cool bro and then um carrots like Wow proper you guys look so cool and then Robins like oh my how cute you look like insects leave it to ramen Robin to put a dead pan down on everything aren't you gonna wear that stuff too that's what's on geez askings or almost like nah it did just slow me down you might need it though you bout to use lower than mine after all man saw Angie sticking in Joe's face you got uh you got a higher fealty it's almost like an MA and flashes off another cliff just the flex on him bro I love that it's on you flex this is bounty Zorro clenches his swords and just cuts off another glyph oh I've been Sarge it's like whoa you want to go at it then I'll kill you the numbers like what are you two doing and then we got robbed insane I wrote you mentioned that Onarga chimas entrance is always in winter so it'll be cold what does that mean their seasons aren't very consistent here on the mainland either it'd be perfect for us if the climate is cold there since we're covered in fur that's what the makes that are saying that means our biggest worry should be the weather conditions rather than the climate itself there'll be there will definitely be a moon that night a full moon but if it is hidden by the clouds it won't be much use to us that's right if all the minks are able to fight the way caret did it'll be an advantage major advantage for our side so whether we'll be able to use Subang will defend our luck oh sorry so whether we'll be able to use oolong will depend on our luck regardless we need max turn whooshing the guardians to make it back in time what's wrong Luffy that's what choppers asking big mom is here but jimbe still hasn't come she's the reason we are able to escape oh so the finally bringing up djembe all we're seeing a picture of djembe even if it's just a flashback and then the rearguard please leave it to me don't forget you and BAE I'm your captain now we'll wait for you oh no you must come he took care of his loose ends we could join us I'm sure he'll be a welcome addition that's what Laura says there's still time if he's alive we'll come he's definitely alive he'll come it's a Luffy's worried about you and May that's nice to see that's nice to see outside the gates at the flower capital episode out the witching hour boy came last night what wait a minute I may be forgetting one oh but wasn't uh wasn't what's-his-face I Tony Lee also I think he was I can't believe I forgot his name I feel so bad but I can't believe wasn't he the witching hour boy if I remember correctly I'm pretty sure he was the witching hour boy but yeah whatever let's just keep me I'm pretty sure that just means there someone else so the witching hour boy came last night there wasn't any news of a robbery in the capital no was there but look there's money here we may not be able to participate in tomorrow's fire festival but will at least be able to afford some water with this so this is M Basu town right smiling folk then we're in curry oka borrow town the mountain hideout of the bandits was burned to the ground you look like you know something about it so he's just Holmes just trying to bully people when we all know how trash this man is okay so why would they continue to steal food from our farm instead of coming for revenge well start talking I don't know anything what's prosper that's the crowds and then it's like if the rumor about the nine routes gabbard's returning this true maybe they're responsible for the missing food in that case we cannot give them away which we do what are you lot mumbling about I will show you the way do not lay another hands on these people so that's a suru and yep can a man's life oh oh Sulu show me so you know what happened you will see if you follow me although it'll be a long journey they must have gathered a lot of people to require all that food kin Aman you must really be back in one oh right I could not believe it when I met Kiku that's a weird ending Kiku no joke right I could not believe it when I met Kiku know Joel again I still hate the fact that Keith who's a man it just kills me it steps on my soul and I know it steps on a lot of other people's souls because that video got 1800 views but yeah let's just keep going and then OC was like I will not allow them to thwart your plans please return the country to the Kisuke clan Oh - there's no need to cover for us that is right you do not need to worry about us getting enough food to eat are filled with a dream come true none of us would mind dying after that and then she's like huh and Hold'em is like huh huh the night before the final battle oh so there's these Bert's model users no bird so that's a bird small loser that's a butterfly small user and another bird smile user okay so it's true after all it's really here stop lollygagging in and do as I told you so I'm not sure who those bird dudes are the smiles are weird because it's like a whole it's a whole animal on them right I quote him he's got an actual lying stomach that tomorrow user we just saw there's like an eagle head on his head like it's just kind of weird I like the normals Owen just like augmented animal abilities instead of a whole another animal so it's like hmm the smile was they I have a lot of potential but Oda has not been expounding on problem that yet so now we're at Currie beach well as you wish so we're at the sunny now wait as you wish should be a peak piece of cake so the small users are looking at the sunny no no no did the Sun you just get destroyed if it got destroyed I'm gonna be so triggered so there's a whole explosion it's been destroyed excellent Moo ha ha ha I think that's wrote you sayin that next up the great bridge linking TB and Jude on is this real okay isn't it this bridge important silence move on to the next one I think they destroyed the sunny I think they just destroyed the pirate Kings ship did they just destroyed the pirate king ship um I'm kind of him did they just destroy the future pirate king ship okay then okay let's just persevere through this because yeah this is one piece greatness and Oda will probably make it right in the coming chapters okay look at the bridge connecting the two regions all right so the great bridge linking ringo and hack my is also destroyed cliff the great bridge connecting the two regions why did this happen now we cannot cross and that's just the random just wanna people in a rope she's like next up the curry port Itachi these ships will never sail again good just as planned so he blew up all the ships but what happened did they get to see the same where I myself but could they really have left 20 years through time from within a burning castle or less the true that their heads were never found so I can never be certain of their death well even if I had seen them it would still be hard to believe the bridge linking Korean Sudan is now destroyed to make matters worse that fool gasps three good oh yeah it's like discord and that's another I saw discord I was confused I just thought if the chatting app but okay just to make matters worse that fool Yasui cost some discord for my retainers they were already doubting me after all it was all a prank Wow but just remember that throwback to Tony Yasu he made me a laughingstock but it turned out that these reports were accurate it does not matter whether others take my words seriously so long as I am the one with power so he's just the power obsessed guy and he's like Moo ha ha ha ha if I block every route leading to the port to collie a I wonder what they'll do 4000 people it's quite impressive that they were may able to gather so many however not a single person will show up so right the straw hats weren't there because the bridges were blown up it's kind of weird though cuz wouldn't come on no the bridges were burst up because it's just all the bridges exploded I feel like that would be kind of news the ghost of the red scab reach out true despair once they realize they have been abandoned they will not be given the opportunity to take the revenge now back in the present you dumb port to cog a stop it all of you if we go now we'll just be suicide because now the nine scammers are trying to go by themselves we can try at a later date the next chance we get we get out a fourth wait another year this is Kinnaman we will never get another chance to do this discreetly our caption of Oh dawn will be exposed and then kinda will spend his entire army or since his entire army to hunt down each and every rebel we will not be able to steal any more food either I am sure you heard the reports for avenue curry presidents of oka borrow put their trust in us to win the final battle they cover for us and their town was burned to the ground my wife was there so yeah hold him burn the town down and it's like please let us go lord momo knows k we do you really command us to run again and lift the rest of her lives in shame at the moment no scales like what would become of me then and then Rises like survive living together with lady Hiyori you can and then he's like do not decide for me and then ki no moans like your father must alone at first too if we I never met Lord Odin none of us would have become samurai we were just a ragtag group of amateurs that is why must carry out our duty as Lord Odin Samurai until the bitter end and then listen up everyone there's a reason why this country has been isolated for hundreds of years so this is a flashback to Odin talking and that reason is equally connected to the Kisuke fan and time its purpose will be fulfilled in order for the tribes of this world to turn we must open Manos Bert Pat borders I just messed it up at last and it's like in the past thirty nine years ago the flour capital and then wait did I just give up H no I didn't then they're like hey hide your daughters hide your wives close up shop during this era there was an infamous and charismatic commanding flower Capitol Heights livestock hurry here he comes so if they're hiding like their wives daughters livestock Kisuke Oh Eden has returned he failed to set sail again hurry up and die already ah how suffocating this country is to preempt so they're clowning Odin for trying to set sail hell I guess an Odin just from a silhouette he looks like he's gonna be another goofy Oda character character that's what it just kind of looks like just another goofy character but like super strong so I'm excited to see old and I'm tired of seeing the man silhouettes and that was the end of the chapter so this chapter I give a solid six or maybe seven because setup chapters are needed it kind of sucked to be over but I guess maybe like ten more setup chapters kind of but the setup chapters are about to leave and it's just like yeah I'm tired of seeing Odin silhouette I just want to see his actual face you know what I'm saying you feel me and I can't wait for wanna to finally get rolling that's just gonna be great that's gonna be lip that's gonna be awesome I'm probably going to stop this room now because I don't really have any other chapter predictions you know what I'm saying it's just like the chapter was good it was good not bad not outstanding it which is good and there's nothing really to discuss about it just a bunch of information it's not like chapter nine hundred fifty seven or fifty six where a lot of theories can stem from this just information and even though those other chapters for information I was like information with mystery this is just hard factual information right here so there's not really a lot I can do so yeah thanks for watching if you draw my content and only finger on my content like this video subscribe to notifications for more one piece content and yeah I'll see you guys in the next video and I will see you in the next weekly stream hopefully next chapter will be fire peace", "_otT1DVvdxQ": "uh-uh anime fans one-piece fans what's good the answer that question of course is one piece one pieces was good let me just adjust the mic real quick and yeah as you can see another one-piece live reaction I am actually sick right now so that's why my voice kinda sounds weird today we got the straw hat if you know what I'm saying we got the straw hat so yeah let's start this one piece chapter 961 huh let's go so it's called the mountain god incident so it's kind of a continuation from the flashback last week so that's gonna be pretty cool huh let me just adjust em put some more because I feel like it's not bad it's in a bad position alright so the cover page is beige on my family and we got where these people attacked so that's a bunch it's just a bunch of attack people we see a gotti and Viggo I think his name was I don't know I kind of got a thing I think it's Viggo but we see them there so now we get into the actual flashback of the story so it's just everybody screaming because if you remember the giant goat was coming so that's what we'll do about the giant mountain God so we got all these people yelling and running and then kinema is like are the people around him men are like could the capital really get destroyed over this little thing and the pig was like oink oink and then Kenny mourns like Oh be quiet so I guess it actually was c'mon not the UM people around him hmm so right we're gonna see that so that is why I told you to give it to me no please wait this bar is worth a white piece of gold I finally pay off my debts then I would and bendre was just laughing at him and then Odin said tuck in Amman give me the boar and then Sandra was like he's Kisuke Odin the one and only the only adult I do not despise for being a fool the white man I actually respect so if we're just on the subject of dead row a little bit just on the subject of dead row he really seems like kosher oh you know what I'm saying like this is the one thing I love about what nothing wrong I think one of the many things I love about one piece just the tons of Easter eggs and throw back so Sandra looks a lot like the kid virgin of kocho the man who kind of trades ro and the sword techniques the one who's dojos always under and the father of Kawena so that is some some stuff to look at right there right so Dan was just looking at oten and I'm raishin and the people are like the mountain guard would only come down the mountain if this child was kidnapped somebody brought a child here why Poor's been the ancient errands of sorry white boards mean that heralds of gods is a chat knowledge many assume there was only a superstition we must appease the mountain gods very quickly keep an eye out for a small whiteboard if we failed to return at the mountain God to the mountain God the capital will be destroyed sorry my meetings kind of off because as I said sickness so right let's just get back into it so like oh so now we see it this this is the one big picnic she's like oink oink and just bite some building in half so the pig is like as big bigger than a whole city block this is giant and people are like it's eating humans and houses whole wah so the pig is just kind of roaring through places and then one guy's like please help me save me yeah our Father so one please help the borate my daughter this is a nightmare so this boar is just up this is one angry mother to say the least so you know how they say don't be don't get between a bear and a child don't get between a mountain guard in its child just uh just a word of advice let me respond to the chat real quick all right so let's get back into this there you are I finally found you hey you are the boar Napper you stole it from us anyway you must take it back to the mountains immediately mountain guard is headed straight for us follows the little guys scent we had no idea this would happen my comrades where you can find the mountain God because they had the little boy sent on them what your friend Oh Cyril got caught up in the mess - what we wanted to get the white boar back from you so we took her hostage but while we were making our way down the mountain they were already in and then kinam on it's like this is all your fault that monster will come straight here because of the scent here it comes so Ken Amon is mad and can I March is facing down this boar man huh he is facing down this boy just like that's when you gotta pull it respect on Kinnaman okay like as much as respect that you gonna put on this hat right Foxfire c'mon he can cut fire and now like when he realized the food was eaten by the mountain goat or bora we know she's not eaten cuz we've seen her 20 years later or more than that but she he's just facing I don't even think he could cook fire at this point so you know like he's got guts and he's facing down this force and you gotta put respect on kid him um for that let me respond to the choice just again okay so alright let let's get back into this what am i doing okay I'm talking too much sniffing if the boys just glaring down at him and then he's just for calling Oh sue he stole again how awful and he's like I'll pay you back get a real job kid Aman if you stay in the Yakuza you will probably end up dead fine by me no one would care if I died anyway how sad and then he's like give me back old suru and he's just remembering all these things about her and then he jumps on divorce now and slashes his nose okay I see you even though that did nothing so he slashes this boars nose and then the board just headbutts a house and just matches him into the house so that's that's some savagery that's some savagery then we see the boars blood on the ground or wait nope is that the poorest player to kill bronze book oh he jumped up the boars nose and stabbed the boar or slashed the boar in the forehead and then a bunch of guys are like boy stop it if there's a mountain guard wha no could be destroyed and then the kanima is like I will slice open your stomach beast I will get o Tsuru back what kind of God are you and then the big just borings again and smashes his head and to the more buildings to try and Rekha wrecking him on up in here ref you kill him on except you're not dead obviously then Odin said exactly what I've been thinking that boy has guts yes he does and then dad was like stop it kid Aman then we see blood this time it is come on blood and he falls down I still can't get my head around the fact that Ken Amon was blonde when he was younger oh wow Wow let me respond to the chat one more time but anyway okay I am talking way too much bro there's some funny things up in the chat but then Ken Aman's lying on the ground he's kind of bloodied and wait right he's seen the mountain gone upside down because he is like on the ground and he's like if Oh soon dies because of me then I have no right to continue living and then get him on like hey boy is this what you've been looking for wait oh no Odin all right so this is probably the the beginning of Odin's like submission of Currie kind of well this is the flower capital but this is probably what cotton respect how we met Ken Amon got kin Aman under his wing and Odin's like facing on the war now holding the pig and then the guy I'm still not completely sure who he is I guess he's just some random Harold Romano he's like Odin Kazuki that cursed child he's behind yet another disaster so now they're blaming up on Odin when it was kind of mom's fault wait I guess when he do things and it be be uh-hmm they're just kind of blaming everything on Odin because he's got such a reputation and also just responding to something that was said in the chat I can't really put the pictures of the actual chapter on the screen because that will get me very much copy strike that I have done it before and I had to delete those videos so maybe I could find a way around it but for now I'm not gonna be able to do that and then the Herald's like he caused this and then Odin's like I was craving some more and then all the people are like give me back my money how my mother not money how could you do something so cruel get me back my daughter and then can I was like no I am responsible for this but Odin is taking all the blame and then Odin's like Odin to swordstyle so he used the to store style not the one torn style the three sword style not the UH not the four sword styles that's the thing or the nine sword style or anything like that the two sword style and he's like Odin - sword style token shirataki okay okay so we are actually starting to get a glimpse of the power that Odin Kazuki possesses he just used his apparently what's the tacho it when did he call it his in shirataki so he just used an attack of his toga Derek's heart of the I'm tripping over my words toga in shirataki to slice the boar in half like at the mouth so like where the mouth starts he sliced it just like completely through and this board like as big as multiple city blocks then all the people are just like in shock they're like what like the boar right now it just looks like a super Wow so that is a very uh powerful attack to say the least he cut the boar like boom right at the mouth and down its whole body so Odin is definitely a powerful individual a nobody was just feeding that but we're just starting to see even when he was young Odin's doing pretty things and then then droves just looking at him like oh so cool kena Mars in chalk and then he Ogura was among the crowd so he overall is probably planing to start the boar cuz he'll grow seems like a person who definitely would have the power to stop the boars but she's like we should head back cuz he don't have to do anything because Odin stopped it and now then this is like the narrator now and I said that an entire village worth people was eaten by the boar by the board the council may have survived but nearly a quarter of the city was lost miraculously there were no human fatalities and then oh so apparently he cut the bar open and then all the people came out so then we just see a bunch of people awake all right so soon who came out the stomach of the board she's like Kim Chan and now she's all crying and stuff and then they're like what wouldn't it was so cool we should probably thank him but it was his phone in the first place he's a criminal and then one guy's like he's so cool I almost cried out and odd they're all thinking and then Ken Omar was like listen to everyone I have a confession to make and then and then kid Amon is like I guess he feels bad that Odin I guess kin Amon is feeling bad that Odin took all the blame for his mess up so he's like listen everyone I have a confession to make and then Odin smashes him on the head that would be pointless okay so like we were already hinted that this is the type of person that Odin is but now it's like we're starting to see like even though Odin does a lot of crazy stuff a lot of morally questionable questionable stuff he's still like a good guy like he literally knocks get him on out for like tried to confess that he was the one who brought the mountain guard down on the flower Capitol I know it's like that would be pointless and then this guy he's like uh he seems to be the UH he seems to the sky he seems to be the person who's like the what's the word the secretary of Wooden's father whose name I can't remember right now and there's a lot of theories circulating that he might actually be Orochi and I guess he does kind of look like a real G and then he said I apologize for the timing but and Odin's like wah ha ha I see so I have been disowned not only that but I've been exiled from the capital so Odin's dad just exiled him at this point so I guess this was kind of the start of uh it is kind of a star of his assumption sub subjugation of the curry of the curry region because he got exiled after this and then they're like how pathetic Lord Shogun it looks like you like the entire flower capitals mitad that it cannot handle me anymore so and is like laughing at them and then he said this is exactly what I wanted time to head over to the other side of the river I'll be sleeping there by the sunset I mean something to eat so by agents doesn't then Odin cost the mountain God incident but it was actually kind of mom but the history records will say Odin did it so it's a bit crazy because o it is like they had they admitted they can't handle me anymore by exiling me so so yeah it's crazy in a chat if you wonder why I keep grinning and a chat that is not the see to chat somebody keeps making means out of this reaction screenshotting me and making memes which is why I keep cracking up from down sit on my bad and then assumes like why you cry are you crying Kim Chan and then he's like of course not oh suru that man I would happily die for someone like him so he's like of course not of course I'm not crying and here's our literally just streaming down his face it's like I would have to leave that for someone like him and I know she was like are you sure you're not crying and then uh then dentro was like I feel the same way and then all right and then drill runs after Odin and then he'd kill him I was like hey wait up dander oh and McDonald's like you inspire me first and then I was like the most no way is different I will be his first follower so Dan euro and kid Amon are arguing over uh dendro and Kinnaman are arguing over who will be Odin's first follower so like that just you always see how inspiring Odin is when people are arguing I want to be known as his first followers it's an interest there's like he inspired me first and then two months like the emotional weight was different so I had to be these words following so like you just know Odin is like goofy level inspiration right here and then the people who are just watching them who al who like live in the flower capital are like I envy their free spirits that want to go with them too and then it's the narrator's like at this moment these men suppress their desired followed him and on this day in on wait and on this day the balance of the capital was tilted at more ways than one so that it says Ronal the haka by region so we're in how come I now welcome welcome Lord Odin is as a pleasure it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Thorin Jia Hui has been looking forward to your arrival stop lying no way he would be happy to see me you are correct I would not oh yeah suey all right shemar ski Yasui rest in peace man but this is the flashback so you're not dead yet and he's like you're correct I would not get excited over sorry he's like you are correct I would not get excited over an exiled fool from the capital what do you want Onan and you even brought some henchmen with you and then and then oh and it's like uh ah please hold on there's a puddle or no not Odin sorry I get confused Yasui is like subordinates are like oh please put on there's a puddle all right please step over me to cross the puddle and then oh just like hey uncle what's with this creepy weirdo and then the asking was like do not be so rude he is my newest servant and then oh I see you mr. Ichiro Oda I definitely see okay so some people were telling me this chapter was mid but that is definitely not okay so the guy the Secretary of own ins father was not Orochi the new service that Yasui was talking about the one who jumped on a puddle so Odin could step over him to get to Lord Yasui is actually Orochi so somebody who would throw his own body over a puddle - uh somebody who had like literally jump on a puddle Toula old and passed over without stepping in the puddle later betrayed Odin vilified him and tried to tell all of his subordinates and he's this little nice child version of a roach she says hey I was taken in by Lord yeah sweet my name is Orochi but I am a humble servant or he said I am but a humble servant and he just is a little brass foot like snot running down his face he's all hurt from jumping on the ground like that let Odin walk over the puddle without like wetting his shoes and he's all humble this this chat was not dead this is actually a big reveal so Orochi with a servant of lord Yasui who he just killed he literally just killed his former okay that was a plot twist I did not expect coming I just assumed that I wrote he would be like a member of one of the royal households but no but bruh Oh another going on twist I see I did not expect that coming let's get a round of applause for Eiichiro Oda please another going to plot twist so I was talking to one of my boys on discord and he said he feels like every chapter of wanto from chapter 3 is slowly and slightly getting better each chapter and I'm starting to agree with that I mean it's like since act 3 so bro so Orochi was the servant of thorn yes we and whatsmore lord Yasui took him in when he was but like some poor homeless kid on the street apparently we don't know where I guess we took him in from but yes we took him in and he was his new servant and he jumped on the ground for odin to cross safely but he is now the evil Shogun of our know who's a coward who ate an Opie devil fruit who teamed up with Kaito who tried to erase oh it is like good history vilify him make everyone hate him and kill all his subordinates and is literally leaving guano in the pit of Hades right now and it's been horrible to all citizens and making more kids like how he was probably before he joined yeah sweet what a jerk so yeah you can expect more videos probably around like this blockless but good plot twist mr. Oda let me just say you can see my clapping so this chapter was a 9 out of 10 just for that plot twist I know a lot of you are gonna be like it was just one plot twist but I feel like this was a super big one like this was a good plot twist like this is a plot twist that kind of changes our view of who Orochi is it really does yeah I respect this plot twist uh-huh so yep nine outta 10 chapter I'm a wrap this up thanks for watching if you drama content and only teen drama content like this video subscribe in another kitchen for more one piece called that oh that's probably the fastest I've ever said that and yep taking off the loopy hat which is how you know I'm about a dip and yeah I will see you in the next video", "xfPaglwe-Uc": "okay good afternoon and welcome to views and this latest debate is looking back while looking ahead were six months down the road from Paris and the international climate deal that was reached there and and the question we're here to talk about today is has Paris really delivered that low-carbon investment signal that Europe has been looking for that Europe needs and if not when is that going to come and how might we deliver it in particular the role for EU policy makers in that so we have three panelists today first of all start in the end mr. Tom Fong yoland welcome deputy and acting head of the unit for strategy and economic assessment at DG climber European Commission secondly to my right Jonathan gaveta director at the think tank III G based in London but leads work on European energy policy for them and finally Eric where pneus senior vice president and chief economist at statoil who's in Brussels today presenting stats oils energy perspectives 2016 which is basically are your Global Energy Outlook out to 2040 as so to kick us off and I maybe turn to you Tom and let's start with a big question well do you think Paris has delivered the low-carbon investment signal we need and what would you what would you say Europe is doing to respond to the outcome of Paris to implement it thank you well I think if you look at what Europe needs to do right now it needs to implement this indc once we ratify that will be our NDC but the point is we need to make sure we put the poles in place to deliver the emission reductions we have said we would do there I think we are clearly on schedule the Commission has already proposed legislation on the side of the ETS to cover what the ETS should do to deliver on where we want to get for 2030 we are in the process in the commission of looking at the other sectors these are notably what we refer to as the non ETS the sector's I site of DTS currently regulated by the effort sharing decision and the sector's related to land use and we are still on schedule we want to be out before summer with the proposal and I think it's appropriate that we're in Parliament because it will be co decision so if you ask what we will do as legislators they will of course have to do their work now and look into what we propose and deliver in the end in the legislative instruments to deliver on Paris but what is more important in a race that we don't do that independently we are integrating climate policy strongly with energy policy so one of the energy union were also preparing a number of policies that are highly relevant for climate change policies and also this initiative welcome to the table this year think about energy efficiency think about renewables so I would say the union is well on its way to prepare itself to deliver on Paris just 11 follow up before I turned to the others the fort I understand the work Commission's also been working on new energy market scenarios which which underpin all of these new proposals that are due out are they also out before the summer I assume you relate to projections now or you lady originally developing the energy market initiative energy market the reference scenario scenarios which look at what you think it's happened to we have we basically have a two to three year cycle that we evaluate what current policies deliver on the energy system at large and we link it through the moon co2 emissions to give also a picture on it means for greenhouse gases and those scenarios will also be out this summer okay so they'll be out before together with the July package okay can you give us any flavor of what what findings you you have in those do are they going to another radically different from two years ago and in the light of Paris and energy Union I mean development since then no I don't think they are radically different the only thing is the difference between two years ago and today is if you look at the reference which is not what we have promised to do but it's what we will think we achieve with the existing policy set it's that a number of new policies have come online think about the F gas regulation and those policies if you feed them into the model they do show a further decrease of emissions but there is nothing new and radical i would say in the reference of course it's not yet but we have said that we would do and that's why of course we need additional legislation to deliver them okay Jonathan do you agree that it sounds like we're largely on track everything is ticking along nicely in the way prepares I think I think ticking along is an interesting phrase there i mean i think if you look at the global picture the reverberations of the various agreements of it's still being felt we've seen an incredible confidence boost about the direction of travel in the global energy transition we've seen countries like china who have already caught up to the to the EU in terms of clean energy investment per person published in the new five-year plan really ambitious strategies to keep going further on wind and solar on electric vehicles we've seen businesses pledge global businesses to pledge increasingly source their own energy use from renewables we've seen cities right ramping up their own ambitions including with the launch of the global covenant today and then the story we get in in the U is that things that things are just ticking along now that the problem is that actually we've seen clean energy investment falling in the EU and in recent years globally other countries are seeing this extraordinary market opportunity developing in clean technologies not just renewables but also smart energy technologies a great investment for example so ticking along might mean that we end up taking sitting behind in terms of really being able to benefit from from this investment opportunity and what concretely what do you think I mean should be happening at this point I'm also looking at what's politically feasible I suppose at this point in time why would focus on on two areas first of all that the Paris agreement set up a timetable for countries to come back together and to review what's already on the table and to progressively go forward to get from where we are now towards well below two degrees or even 1.5 now the next dialog is in 2018 it's a global dialogue that's really going to be at the moment where countries come together and say okay this is what we agreed at the end of 2015 how do we get from here to the next stage and at the moment I'm really concerned that the EU might turn up to that pretty much empty handed saying we're still taking along the other opportunity I would seize is the is the redesign redevelopment of EU electricity markets there's proposals as mentioned due out later this year about what that what that will look like so far a lot of the public discussions have been about or capacity markets a good idea or a bad idea but actually it's a real opportunity for the EU to seize the initiative in terms of consumer offers in terms of looking at how to integrate the energy markets with with digital markets with look at new new types of service with it provisions look at sort of smart homes demand response and other elements like that this is got the potential for for really being an expanding global market so it's one of the earliest opportunities that the EU has to get on the front foot okay I'll give you a chance to respond in a in a moment but let's first turn to you and Eric and perhaps give us a so you're here presenting energy perspectives for this year give us a flavor of how those are different to to last year how those involved over the years and maybe also whether there are any key areas for priority action that you pick out another global so yeah speak globally but maybe with some ideas for the Europe as well within that yeah I know this is a global perspective to 2040 and we realized that that the outcomes in terms of global energy is very uncertain depending on which driver will be most important for the development compared to last year of course one important milestone was was the Paris agreement and that has been incorporated in our central scenario which we call the reform scenario and and where we assume that all those targets that were agreed upon or the pledges that we made are actually followed up by measures and delivered on in addition we assume that those targets will be as part of the process will be tightened even further when we go to 2025 and onwards so that it's even tighter that being said the energy related co2 emissions globally that come out of that scenario are very far away from being consistent with the climate targets so much more is needed therefore we have another scenario where we assume that what if the energy sector is absolutely actually able to deliver on the two rogatory really reducing global co2 emissions by forty five percent within 20 40 and we shows the fantastically challenging not very likely but possible way there a nut con basically contains an energy revolution then we have a third scenario which you do which you also can think is relatively likely unfortunately and that's called Ribery and that's a scenario where we do not agree where we have geopolitical conflict we have sports hotspots of regional conflicts like the Middle East and North Africa where other important policy elements drive the development in that scenario we will not reach the targets will not be able to deliver one on the pledges made in Paris so a lot of the things that are happening in Europe are very positive but we need in order to get both to the toodle it actually deliver on the targets in Europe we probe we need further reforms not only targets but we need measures we need changes to the carbon pricing regime we probably need much tighter integration of the electricity markets in order to provide the necessary investment signals that being either renewable electricity or the necessary backup that we need all the great investments that we need or the batteries that we need to put in place and also the sectors outside of the energy sector needs to be looked at and and I think what is what is a general issue is that the challenge is probably slightly different in markets which are growing an electrifying like many of the emerging economies where where there is the potential to jump across some of the old fashioned technologies and start using the new renewables where technology is fortunately helping and the sector's worries about transitioning in in Europe basically this is about changing the way we produce electricity it's not about changing the electricity demand it's not about growing electricity demand at least not much and it's not about growing energy demand it's about changing the system and that process is difficult it's it slightly different than in emerging economies and therefore also we face different challenges in that way no what what scenario would you say or what mix of scenarios are are we in today's on the one hand as you said Paris is part of your reform scenario it's been incorporated on the other hand we see certainly in Europe I mean we have seen some more fragmentation to some extent that countries doing more of their their own thing so that's more like your rivalry scenario so they both elements of both yeah I mean you can find signposts on all these scenarios involving current media and in current in things that are happening at the moment so and then it depends on which I mean a situation with economic sanctions to one of our biggest neighbors it's an example of what would take place in the robbery scenario we're in that situation today unrest in the Middle East we're not scenario today on the other hand the Paris agreement was a signpost that there is an increased willingness to do something seriously at the global level with energy and climate policies that could move is on the right direction that is both the signpost for the reform scenario and it's a signpost for the renewal scenario there's some of the developments that we might see in the light-duty vehicle sector which is the one that has to train we think has to try and transform the quickest some of the things from there move was towards the before the renewal scenario but generally on energy and climate policies that mean measures no targets the globe is very far away from both the reform and a renewable scenario in that sense we're not moving in the right direction in spite of in fantastic things happening different places but but we are it's it's hugely challenging to deliver both from the energy efficiency that we have to do everyone in order to meet these targets and on the change in the energy mix we are building coal-fired power plants every day globally still and they're still being built cold for our power plants in Europe yeah that is a sign that we're going away from the reform and rivalries there in the rules and oreos towards something else okay maybe coming back to you Tom maybe a reaction to to you you've heard and specifically I mean one of the points for example in in 2018 what do you imagine is what would the EU come come to the table with what well it doesn't have to be new targets but more specifically perhaps new measures what could we say well you know this is what we've done in the meantime yeah well in 2018 is the facilitative dialogue and there's an invite to come by 2020 with update of the NDC talking about measures I think that's an interesting element I think well so that I say so I do think in Europe there are a lot of measures co2 in cars is a measure that impacts the transport sector our internal market progress and the linking of the market has allowed well basically certain regions to expand their renewables capacity and we think that should be further integrated so there's a strong focus on the further integration of the internal market including the interconnections I think these are measures that we have implemented and these are measures that we will continue to implement and improve again these are all elements that are on the package beat this year bead in the coming years that we will bring forward so to say that you could call it ticking but yes the clock is ticking in Europe and we are doing that and we are transforming our measures and just simply saying that that well it's not delivering I think is one because i think it exactly delivers you might say you want to do more or less okay that's one thing but we are doing the policies to transform our economies I'll keep it there but I would not be so negative about what we as Europeans are doing to prepare ourselves on measures let's put it that way engineering the the pace that the pace is high enough because I guess one thing is it's the problem with climate change is always a timing issue so we may get we are putting things in place but are we is it going to be enough to help help the world peak I mean peak emissions in the next five five or ten years that's a different question i don't think the action that you will do will lead to picking on well in a way we are too small in the rich people these days to deliver that feed has things changed in the world i think they have yes i think we all recognize that we are not on a to the grid pathway and we also recognize that we need measures to implement the end this season and often it's asked what is important about Paris well what is important that people now implement the NDC's because in dtn disease are often target related and target doesn't mean the measure to deliver on target am I hopeful at least the biggest emitter globally has seen recently a scaling down and actually a plateauing of emissions is that due to measures or is that due to structural changes I think it's both part of the the answer but then again because it's also part of the measures you need to be honest enough that it's good I mean the fact that we are not number one in investments in renewables these days is a good thing because others we mean who need more investments to get there right now are starting to do that so I I wouldn't look at it from a bleak perspective that we are not by definition the biggest investor right now in renewables I certainly see that the the global growth in renewables investment is it's a very good thing up nearly a quarter last year with the the bleakness that we're talking about isn't isn't because the global investment is going up but also because european investment is going down you know the number of people employed in the solar sector last year for example fell rather than rose and this is happening at a time where we York is still facing an employment crisis still badly needs investment that we just haven't been able to mobilize so I would certainly agree with the with a perspective that there's a difference between fast-growing economies that are rapidly electrifying and and economies that perhaps aren't growing quite at the same pace and have a large amount of rectification already but I think there is a need to look at how that investment can start growing again and actually that's a question of not just promoting investment but also some disinvestment of high-carbon sectors to make the space for lower carbon investment as well starting probably with coal sack okay I said I think on this investments in the new renewables that we're facing and that we might have some challenges in order to continue the growth in Europe as well is it it's also one of the early signals that that it is a bit difficult to foresee how you can operate an electricity system with a business model that works for all participants when intermittency seasonably varying renewables come in and take a large part of the electricity system that's where you that's when we need to integrate the 28 EU countries on the rest of Europe into one system we need to regulate both the grids and the backups and the batteries that we need in order to sort of show the industries that this is a business model that's actually going to work that you can make money on electricity and and where it's not only the marginal the new investments on top of something but you actually need to cater for the system course and that is the challenge that that hasn't been sold which is something that we have to look at going forward then we also want to go on a global scene what is important to remind ourselves about is that the electricity is today twenty percent of the overall final energy consumption and that is growing fortunately in some countries is growing from very small chairs and often it can potentially grow to thirty to thirty-five percent the overall energy use but not everything can be electrified so we ought to also have to hand in order to address any of these climate argit's with meshes we have to we also have to look at the potential for energy efficiency in the other sectors for some decarbonisation in particular to get coal out of the mix and then see how efficiently we can do it with all the parts week because we cannot electrify everything and then it's about where where does that energy come from how much of that is oil how much of it is gas how much you it's biofuels and new renewables and how much of the Rama remaining energy will be called we will still need some cold and then how much of that can be where we can mitigate the climate impact with carbon capture and storage and there's no silver bullet here this is something that where we have to look at all kinds of measures in order to go in the right direction what happens to oil and gas and your different scenarios or what's the what's the range and particularly for the maybe for the degrees one behind it in our a two-degree scenario what we called renewal we actually reach the target the oil and gas will still be forty-five percent of the overall use of energy globally its fifth it's likely about 50 today and it will go down to 45 out of something which is just moderately larger so the I the total need demand for oil and gas in that scenario is slightly less than today the gas demand is flat globally that's the most conservative estimate the lowest estimate that I've seen from from Easton forecasts while the older man is going down by fifteen to eighteen percent so we need with them we will demand slightly less than 80 million barrels per day of oil in 20 40 in that scenario and today we demand 95 million barrels per day and it's a huge challenge to be able to deliver that because we need a lot of investments just to keep production from falling so and the overall new energy we need from oil and gas in that scenario the sum of all the oil and gas delivered by in 20 40 is more than twice the new renewable electricity they would that we need so we need to invest in both both to be much more renewable if you like or low carbon in electricity at the same time provide sufficient amounts of oiling ask for the remaining interviews how do we maybe for your question how do we square that with often one of the outcomes of Paris has been it's often been equated with a decarbonisation agenda but also the end of the the fossil fuel your agenda yet it sounds like even in a two degree scenario there is still substantial presence for fossil fuels which leads them to debates over CCS etc well let's let's not forget that part of the Paris agreement was was a broader agreement to move to net zero emissions in the second half of the century now it may sound like a long time away but for Europe that probably means getting to towards net zero by by approximately twenty fifty if you're building new oil pipelines gas pipelines they could last for 40 to 60 years so all of a sudden that global agreement about the direction of travel rolls backwards and rolls backwards and starts biting into investment decisions that are happening now my concern is that some of the message that we've been hearing from from the oil majors not necessarily just just Statoil but but some of the others has been oh well we'll always need oil and gas we'll always need new this out there so it so we need need the investment the coal industry was saying something similar a few years ago the electric utilities have been been saying similar messages that the future looks pretty much like the past and those two industry is our industries that have been massively disrupted by a much rapid much more rapid change in technologies much more rapid change and consumer behaviors that then we're being expected so I wouldn't underplay the the possibility and the potential for the future to be much much choppier much more dynamic and perhaps much swifter than then it's sometimes exposed first of all I think I think it's it's important to to be realistic about we're very far away from going towards the two divinatory if we're to go in and further i signaled by some of the sentences in the Paris agreement we do not know anything about what that entails argosy have been has been asked to look at that bite when they will do by 2018 and we I think we then have to face up to the reality that what is needed then probably cannot only be discussed within the confines of the energy industry then we seriously have to talk about other elements whether that is agriculture food habits forestry all other kinds of sectors where we have to change something significantly in order to get to anything 990 and which that we have to start counting the carbon binding in our forests which we do not do properly at the moment so that is what we're so far away from the two-degree target that just getting there is a neat it requires a fantastic revolution in many senses in the way we use energy and it is not about Europe this is about delivering on the UN sustainability goal of September last year which was also updated telling us that we need to provide clean and affordable energy to all by 2030 we have 2.4 billion people in the world that do not have access to clean cooking and eating facilities today that's a challenge for the a global energy industry as well and it's not sustainable most to address that either so it has to be both clean and affordable available and it has to be there somewhere between 2030 and 2050 and we're going to get 2 billion you people on the globe by 2050 as well so this is about energy sector doing its part it's about our energy use changing but it's also about a lot of other issues and it's about cost efficiency measures yeah yeah no two views on this first for Paris I think the important thing about Paris is that well we talk about it often as a bottom-up process where countries will themselves define what they want to do but what they have pledged or motive committed sorry that's the correct wording is to make sure that they increase that over time and I think there Paris is well one what they have brought to the table now is already something different than what we would have seen as business as usual only a few years ago so i think that change has happened i think the interesting thing about Paris is also that if you read through the iron disease they are often linked with local development goals if you talk about the need to supply clean energy to all I think nobody would say no to that but the question is how to do it and there are different pathways to choose and I think NDC's are well they are a good starting point to be very concrete on how those pathways will be walked so one thing about Paris on the question on the kind of energy carriers and how what that means for a low-carbon future at least in the you I think we have started to create transparency on that we made a 2050 low carbon road map already five years ago now that was in 2011 that was linked to an energy roadmap and I think if you look through that and it had some tour impact the system the sister it attached to it you start to see that it does impact the kind of energy carriers you have in Europe and of course we do know we're the ones who are carbon intensive have a bigger reduction in consumption and others another element david i think was interesting is at the time when we came out with that we asked both sectors and stakeholders and governments to develop their own 2050 roadmaps different sectors different stakeholders have done that in different ways but just to say i think even stat to all the fact that you look at all these scenarios these days is a change compared to what you would have done a few years ago so I think stakeholders at large are looking at what a low-carbon future could mean for them and I pink and we recognize at all that it doesn't mean that certain energy carrier see decreases and do you one of the points to the other two both both mentioned was that especially because Europe is not a growing demand is not growing here so it's more transition than adding all new new capacity and if anything there's this excess capacity so so basically old coal needs needs to go to create space for newer cleaner forms of energy do you I don't know is the Commission looking at all that uh is there anything we could do a more active while phase-out policy for coal especially because the ETS price remains so low that but that's that's basically not going to do the job anytime soon okay a number of things i'll come back to that in a second one yes in a way we are we are a region where certainly population road is not as big as in other regions but it's not that our energy demand per definition is static I mean we need energy efficiency measures to make it static and to make a decrease over time and I one of the things when we came forward with our 2030 targets was this fact that if we want to deliver on that we also need to half again our energy intensity of our economy so just to say that this is not the definition I mean that it's not unimportant for Europe also to look at energy efficiency and to deliver on that regarding the coal sectors I think we have a good instrument to indicate what the total amount of emissions can be in the electricity sector it's DTS you say that the carbon price at present is too low to give sufficient investment signals yes it may be but I assume that an investor will also look at the future when it makes an investment decision and there I think we only recently had the evolution of the market stability reserve but that will only enter into force in 2019 which we hope will have a positive impact on the carbon price evolution then and we assume that it also respected in an investment choices already today so not to say we have vehicles out there I think an other part I was actually quite recently in a in a coal dialogue it's also with the sector to see how that transformation can happen how can you do the restructuring and it's quite interesting to see that that will also require other policies totally different policies think about social policies think about employment policies to restructure those industries so I think the the way how to tackle that will need different avenues and different policies okay but it's the the ETS that will give that in the long term that that's the main signal the main decarbonisation signal going go ahead for as long as I can detect the policy instrument at the EU level that gives that click clear signal yes yeah but I think relevant related to this with carbon price issue as well it's them in a couple of points there and there are several ways to get to an implicit or a real carbon price the american way of doing it is the fuel efficiency standards that the de facto eliminates the possibility of building a coal-fired power plant at the moment the in place a carbon price for a coal-fired power plant is then infinitely high in the sense we advocate for a carbon price we have an advocate for global carbon price because that gives declare is the investment signal increasingly the oil companies we included we use the carbon price which is much higher than the ETS for any kind of investment decision where it is no matter where it is in order to do to have that as a threshold for which we think this is what we think any project has to deliver on going forward so in our case we apply a fifty dollar per ton globally where no matter where it is and in Norway we on UK where it's higher we we apply the higher price and an increasingly oil companies are doing that reflecting on the uncertainty and what we are thinking that has to come it might not necessarily be a carbon price it can be fuel efficiency regulations in Europe we also have fuel efficiency regulations on the transport sector which works as a carbon price right and and one is one of the reasons why the car producers now see after after the also after the Volkswagen scandal that that they need to produce different car models they they announced that they going they're going to have a series of electric vehicles is one of the changes that might come and that's the type of change of behavior you get even if the carbon price is low but ideally because the carbon pro DTS price is a very good market-based efficient measure it should be higher it should be giving an eclair signal and the irony is that the cheaper renewable electricity becomes the more we subsidize that in a sense that counteracts the price of ets as well into source that we need to think about both right want to come back yeah I think sort of every week for the last decade there have been events in this town where people off sat on panels saying we need a stronger a carbon price and a better better functioning ETS and yet that still hasn't translated through into real investment signals either for low-carbon investment or giving the confidence that the high carbon infrastructure that's already on the system will come out and orderly and and today is trash so in the in the absence of that signal coming forward I think we're seeing increasingly national measures stepping up to pick up the gap whether in the UK and France Germany a number of other countries are looking to to give a much clearer glide path about when they expect coal plants to close and it's not done as environmental measure it's done on this investment measure to make sure that that the investments in the rest of the economy come forward to make up that gap and so some of these bottom-up measures I think are beginning to disrupt some of the policy conversations in Brussels and disrupt the idea that that somehow a price will magically appear that will do all the hard work for us did you see anything in the I mean the the EU ETS reform currently underway that that could deliver a meaningful price I mean as close as possible to 2020 well I think I I think strengthening the UTS is always a good idea I'll appear on panels saying yes it's a good idea to have prices but the stronger price will will be mainly affecting more more short-term operational decisions rather than the longer-term investment decisions for for big capital intensive infrastructure that's going to last 20 30 40 years because the uncertainty over that time horizon there's always going to be too high for you know politically an instrument measure like the gs4 for the faith to be to be that high that it will still be there sometime so what can the EU do I mean ideally the EU we have an energy union which is there taking shape so these decisions especially longer term decisions should ideally shouldn't be being made on a purely national level that's completely counter active two runs counter to the whole concept of the energy union so what could I mean what could flip that round and it's why the the main priority is to stop talking about the ETS in in a vacuum which is perhaps been the case in the past I have seen I guess a shift in attitude amongst people in the institutions and another organizations here in the last few years to acknowledge that the idea of through one price to rule them all is probably not to be all end all so it becomes thinking much more about what the market design looks like much more about looking at what the cross border infrastructure looks like and much more looking at a system transition rather than a price to get us two words decolonization okay so all these other elements of the energy system energy policy yeah more important two things to react on one is do things interact yes they do I I don't think we we we didn't recognize that I think looking at our one material preparing policy proposals to you you see that I mean if you actually do more on renewables or actually have an even stronger energy efficiency policy you tend to see the carbon price going down why because basically well the installations at the mid have less of an effort to do because others are taking more action so elements interact but in the end of the day the the budget in the ETS does go down and it will make sure that change has happened so to say that an investor doesn't care about the ETS when it makes me invest investment I'm a bit surprised it might do it in a different way as indicated by Eric that it up scales the price because it says we don't think this is a reasonable set of indications of her policies might be in 20-30 years that i can understand but to say that the ETS doesn't matter for investments i think is the wrong way way of phrasing it yeah oh yeah definitely matters for investments both on the short and the long term and then of course we while looking at the polls is the the investors are speculating about what it will be like in the future one of the reasons why we apply a higher carbon price than what you currently see in the market going forward and I thank you I think that when when Europe looks that its transition to a lower carbon type of energy use there's no silver bullet wind it's about everything being done energy efficiency is critically important and it's very difficult because that that goes all the way down to our individual behavior once we have more energy efficient equipment available and energy therefore becomes cheaper what do we do with that we then buy a bigger car or don't we Annie top part of the energy efficiency gains and when we have more renewable electricity new renewable electricity is intermittent and seasonably variations the critical importance of having a common electricity market in practice becomes much more important because otherwise you'll have too much solar electricity in Spain and will have too much wind electricity in Germany and we need to be able to interact so therefore we need grid investments and facilitating large scale up investments in grids it's critically important within Europe and within other regions where you need this and the main mainly maybe the most important problem with the low ETS prices that that is the only income component in any carbon capture and storage investments and we probably will need some carbon capture and storage carbon capture and storage is just about costs and it's just about avoiding co2 emissions the only income component in that is the ETS price the avoided carbon price and as long as that is very low than are very few incentives to a nun drivers to help us develop the carbon capture and storage technology which we might need so that's at least one signal where we're sort of that is one of the elements that could drive that development slightly faster and what we see at the mall maybe tomm logs you can come back specifically on ccs but more more broadly so if the ETS matters and it drives you say drives long as well as short-term investment you say probably on its own more short-term investment but what else can we do to strengthen I suppose that low carbon investment signal in particular so if renewals investments are going down not up so how for example the market design package how can that reverse that see that trend being reversed within the next year or two I think the market design what it will do it will make sure that we can accommodate that trend if we don't have market design in a way that we allow for flexibility of the market itself if you allow for the intermittency to play out it's going to be difficult to have more and more renewables I mean there are locations in Europe where there are already high concentrations of renewables so I think it's a facilitator for more renewables I think the market itself is a facilitator prices have come down if you see the projections levelized cost of electricity for certain technologies they are quite I mean optimistic maybe not yet today but if you look at the 2030 framework you start to see quite different impacts and we have well we have done that to our own state aid rules we want to make sure that if one gives state aid to this technology is more market-driven so I think you have all these elements combined that need to make sure that we can well cope and facilitate the further penetration of the renewables we also will have an initiative this year that will look at renewables and it will look at how to deliver the at least twenty seven percent target on renewable so just to say that I think we have a set of policies out there one thing on ccs we still recognize that this is a technology that needs development I mean we need to to see how it works and prepare for that that's why it still included in well the new innovation front as one of the three main domains to see investments we have not succeeded in realizing the amount of CCS demo plans as we had hoped there's a one in progress at the moment but if you talk to the investors they often do talk that the carbon price was one of the elements the reduction of it why they could not materialize the necessary funding with that I mean funding beyond the pure market incentive because there wouldn't have been any CCS project without funding on top of the market I still think we are in that face talking post-2020 with hopefully a better investment signal there and still that funding available let's see if we can have more developments in that context maybe a question we've got just a couple of minutes left if we look at so driving low-carbon and investment so on coming back to the global picture are there particular areas where as well three of you where you think Europe could really lead and it's not just about climate and climate change but could lead in terms of industrial development real opportunities whether it's the way Europe has led in renewables to date could it do the same in the transport sector does it have a particular lead in grid development I don't know where you have any ideas on areas within the energy sector where there is you know Europe should focus on attracting investment there's there's two areas that I'd like to highlight in particular where I think Europe does still have an international competitive advantage it's lost its advantage and in a few low carbon areas i must say but two of the areas in which there is still an awful lot of potential is first of all smarter grids and and system management the technical expertise and and also the physical materials there are areas in which there are a number of european companies that lead and european countries are amongst the first to go through that experience curve of what it's like to run electricity system with higher levels of renewables with more active demand on the system and some of the some of that expertise that's developed here in europe will be needed internationally and we need to make sure that it's europe that continues to lead on that and doesn't follow the second area that I'd highlight is actually looking at what happens to energy intensive industry in Europe at the moment so much the conversation is about preventing carbon leakage and a new kind of giving exemptions to it to the ETS I think as we as the global transition continues we need to look at at what low-carbon energy intensive industries look like how do you create demand for low embodied carbon materials like steel cement etc using some of the technologies that have been developed through innovation funds for example but haven't yet had the incentives to be to be full fully rolled out and so I think that's still an opportunity that we can move forward to cease yeah I think also that there's a potential here for Europe to show how can you go about and regulate this industry there's something about the framework conditions for electricity production in that type of electricity system where the rest of the world will be looking to regions like Europe to see how can we do it and we haven't figured it out yet how can we how can we have a business model that actually operates well that directs the electricity where it's going its demand management it's appoint management is incentives for the consumers it's incentives for the producers is integrating backups and batteries Europe is relatively far north relatively cold during the winter relatively large during the winter we have a competitive advantage advantage in figuring out how can that be handled during a cold winter in the Scandinavian countries where we have a lot and we have no wind because it's quiet and we don't have any Sun except a couple of hours during the day what what type of integrated electricity system does that require if we figure that out we can help decode the other cold or dark parts of the world which which will be in the same situation so so that those are a couple of issues where we we should you should take upon as the ambition to actually the world leading in those types of areas because we we have moved quite quite a bit on renewable electricity and we need to fix it maybe and Statoil itself as an oil and gas company projecting yourself forward into a little carbon future how do you yeah well we will continue to be the lowest lowest carbon emitter of the old producers oil and gas producers the most carbon efficient producer of that and then we were increasingly investment significantly in low-carbon investments where we're investing we're very large now in offshore wind investing both in the UK and I'll have just agreed to go into German is added we see the potential in offshore wind being relatively large because that's where the windmills can become larger and onshore hey we're piloting floating wind mills which can be used on continental shelves which are much deeper and what we've seen in parts of Europe we because they can float like in California or in Japan or elsewhere we're testing that outside of Scotland that will increase as part of our investment profile as part of our capex we will get through increase more there but it needs a belief and signals that we can actually make money so we need to have a business model mudwerks also for that type of energy and that still in the works okay Tom final question for you and one of the I suppose we just had the data in from the European Environment Agency showing where twenty-four percent below are well below 1990 with our missions so to end on when when can we when can we expect a new discussion over well the whole the whole saying are the whole emission reduction package for Europe I think you're very soon the discussion because we will come forward with a proposal on how to share the emission targets in member states that the gallery DTS and how to integrate Land Use will be a very interesting discussion among legislators to adopt that I think it's a good message that we are twenty four percent while our economy is growing I didn't know it was publicized today it was coming so otherwise I would have said it already yesterday okay good no but I mean it shows that we can decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth so yeah we will have to implement now what we have for us to do okay all right thank you to all three of you and thank you for watching views that was an update on where we find ourselves six months after Paris I am sure we will have a plenty more to talk about on that fronts going forward thank you very much thanks you", "U2wYX3HFoEQ": "we need to make sure that Europe is at the front of that five to you revolution and it's not a like it and I think that's going to be at the heart of discussions the mobile mark on breasts this week so first of all we we have our 5g you can compete which is about developing the supply site and we have 700 million euros that are going into that between now and 2020 secondly we need cooperation between the industry the telecoms industry and the verticals to roll out the relevant infrastructure and I can't stress too much I think how much this partnership is important this time around we need the right policy framework for 5g so we have put in place an action plan what's important about that action plan is the scale this time for 5g the scale up needs to be done in a bigger way but it also needs to be done very quickly and we need a coordinated approach it is the new European framework regulatory framework for electronic communications which is underway and it is a clear example of how rules how long can be pivotal in determining for example in this case the degree of connectivity so we are working hard first of all I think we need to decide that we want to be in the front and I think that's might sound a little bit ridiculous because you don't get in the front just by saying it but but you need to say it in order to make all the efforts allocate all the frequencies doing all the jobs that is required in order to be the most competitive because we know South Korea Japan China u.s. countries in Latin America will try morrible so we need to decide that we want to be in the lead because we have the opportunities and then we need to allocate the frequencies I have said that we should make 2022 the golden year securing that all the 700 bands are allocated at that time but also a number of other of the strategically important frequencies can be allocated so in Europe we can have a good field for development innovation and being the best", "PwWX0VxnOng": "oh really so in this video um

underway Verizon just recently announced that they've activated their 5g network in certain areas of Minneapolis and Chicago now it's true you need a 5g enabled phone of which they're very rare at the moment but what I think this indicates is that you can see these 5g networks are now gonna roll across the United States and I would not be surprised if within a year or so any mobile device that you buy is gonna be 5g enabled so 5g is really transformative because of two reasons the first is just the speed the amount of data that can be transmitted Verizon is estimating that you could download in one of these test markets an entire season of Game of Thrones in 14 seconds which is faster than any home Wi-Fi connection at this point the other part of 5g though is it's incredibly low latency the speed at which information is transferred between the device and the cloud the computers that are processing the data this has massive impacts on everything from the potential for delivery drones to fully self-driving cars to you can imagine mixed reality glasses which currently look like this because the computer has to be attached to the glasses now this goes away because all the processing is done in the cloud over a 5g network and these glasses can get smaller and they can essentially look like the glasses that you and I wear every day so we're gonna go much deeper into the impact of 5g at our upcoming future X live the next 10 conference is going to be on April 30th at Georgia will Congress Center love to have you be there Chris MELAS inos who is the director interactive entertainment he's gonna be talking about not just what is possible from 5g but how it will likely improve all of our lives we also have experts from mercedes-benz lab 1886 BMWs Park Park mobile group professor Jeff Snyder from Carnegie Mellon who has worked on these autonomous vehicle platform systems and they're going to be discussing how 5g is going to impact the future of mobility transportation and then because transportation is such a critical part of cities how that's going to affect the cities of the future so I hope you can join us there at the conference we'll also be covering more on 5g as new news breaks through the year here on future excerpts", "pKjuiSrV-3c": "wrong thing uh pull it up one second anime fans 1p fans looks good answer that question of course there's one piece one piece is looks good and today we're live reacting to chapter 958 now I haven't seen any spoilers or how you haven't even heard any reviews of the chapter I've just avoided all the talk of chapter 958 so I don't know what to expect I can kinda guess that it's not gonna be as hype as 9:57 or 956 but I'm still expecting some up his some you know some relative heat just let me respond to the job real quick but uh of course I got my Shazam hoodie right here I know we DC for hands up in here but you know just like you know the whole eco to you know saying okay let's get into the chapter the chapter is called the promised port so I'm gonna assume it's got something to do with the port they're trying to launch off to onegai shima from the port because I heard a Orochi in the last chapter if I recall correctly he heard all they plans so let's do this okay so the cover page is uh Lola it still the gang pages oh my family vol 8 so he's looking at it and they were telling Lola and not when they're telling chef on a mage your sister Lola wasn't dressed Rosa a few days though so you know that's what was meant so let's start this gesture so no no ho bro we're getting the flash back already it's gonna be old and I can see cuz it's a sailing on the calm sea not long before the start of the great era I'm glad I joined you Roger we're getting no time boys I can't believe we're seeing Roger again I don't think that uh Roger I don't ever seen like Roger just interact with people like in a flashback I'm pretty sure besides chapter zero and his execution we haven't seen him do any like talking and interact scene and just being himself and from the looks of this he's kind of like just like a goofy personality he's a kind of drunk right now so that just kinda is cool cuz that's a bit of a milestone for the story because like Murphy Roger thought this is actually an - he's talking Odin so what's all this sentimental crap you softie we're the ones who should be grateful Odin so yeah he is talking Odin and then the croquettes it's like you've had too much booze Roger we need to learn some restraint and then Rogers like attacking him like going up against him he's like shut up I don't need to hear that from the biggest Trump of drunk on the ship so yeah they kind of have a straw hat like dynamic okay so let's go into Chapter four oh mercy buggy and shakes I've been rail ace like one land lend me a hand oh and I really hope we can see what it looks like then shanks for Bucky like I'll help to Odin's an you just get in the way idiot that's what shank says so bunky says I'll help you to Odinson and shank says you'll just get in the way you idiot okay so let me help instead Odin side so Jay so they don't like oh and I'm like ray lays trying to get on Odin's good side and boggy and shanks are both trying to get on Odin's good side so he can tell from this that Odin is gonna be a very charismatic character and a leader in somebody like you you want to be around somebody you want to like you so I really hope we get to see what he looks like for showing it this side so he says rail a red car Oh bookie Giro I appreciate it but there is an internal matter for the Kisuke clan because shanks red car oh and Bucky Bucky Darrow and then really just Rayleigh and then common Japanese this is just an under note common Japanese male endings typically taro first son in hero second son oh so he's calling buggy the inferior one [ __ ] legs get burned clown because like but he is a legitimate clown so like this is kind of cool that he like he's calling buggy the second son so buggy it's like how many times have to tell you to stop calling me Jiro I never understood why wha know had to be closed up to the boarders outside of the world seeking to become Shogun after thoughtlessly abandoning my home and maybe selfish of me but I would definitely make what I have from vision to reality oh man so they are just gonna be still casting that silhouette on Otis not showing us his face that's kind of annoying but okay I'm certain that with the aid of my reliable retainers I will be able to open what\u00f5s borders we shall oversee the fruition of this 20 year old dream you can do it Odin I will Roger so that's cool we got a flashback and we see Roger interacting and talking Odin even though it's really really annoying we didn't get to see his face like I was kind of hoping for that not opening what word is opening I was hoping for that you know what I'm saying so let's just get into the next page because now it's doing the whole musicians Act three it's like a play like you know I've said about three 25 years have passed since that day so he said a 20 year old dream which means that that was probably five years before kind of pulled up and all that so now we just got the wall no country act three and the curtains are opening removed to haku my so port happily this step for Apple so we got a road sheet a row she's like the weather is splendid today this must be a good omen from the gods moo-ha-ha so that is Rho cheek laughs I always loved about one piece that characters would have their own unique laughs and we got Orochi apparently his unique glasses Moo ha ha ha or Moo ha ha ha whatever it is and I just kind of like the laughing distinction so we got a Rocha with a Moo ha ha ha and he's like what a perfect day for a banquet and then of course all his jesseman are like Lord Oh true Orochi deserves it so then we got that I completely forgot his name like the leader of the 11 ninja with the N rue earlobes and the way to call forehead like what's his name I don't remember what he is I don't even remember i write the ninja are called the overwhelming oh no why don't you but I don't remember and that guy's name specifically I'll have to remember that later but he says Kyoto will be looking after the capital in our abs let everyone know so Kyoto he'd been taking care of the capital stuff yes sir I'm lucky for him he cannot participate in the banquet now this is the largest port in mono it is surrounded by huge sea walls lined with beautiful maple trees Lorna Road she please have a safe journey take care there's bright red leaves dance in the wind bidding farewell to the ships so what kind of getting the novel feel so we're seeing Orochi ship sailing down with people with leaves floating around it and all these people cheering him off Roshi he's just taking up the cloud he's eating that cloud up you know what I say so bring the booze let us make a toast to the maple trees Lord Orochimaru Kaito oh he's going to be kind of yeah let's go well it was finally taking off after two acts people to act it's finally taking off let's get into this goodness bro I can't wait like in 20 chapters cuz like if you think about it the Kairos Dragon reveal was a year ago and I sight time has passed so fast so like in a year from now like I can't wait for the hike we're gonna be doing like I know there's a ton of theories Luffy versus kind of leaf he will have like go wood hockey or something like that I don't know what will happen but it's gonna be right so a row she's like there is no need there is no need he probably started drinking himself a bank but for 40,000 people this year sure is to be a delay like always once a year onegai shima the two supreme leaders who over 100 meet face to face and hold a bake but for their armies so I know a lot of people are thinking Orochi ish crash and i know like when saul was going for him he was all like me but I'm kind of feeling like Odom might be trolling that's a bit like I feel like I wrote with you might actually be strong and he might actually be a troll kind of like his rule because like look at that devil fruit and the height peace receive the army he commands they know yet kind of backing him but he it's not like a rote she didn't do anything himself wasn't all these pirates was my take on it so I feel like Rocha might be strong but just be a troll so meanwhile at the flower capital drinkin sink to your heart's content today is the Capitals fire festival today is the only day we are allowed alcohol bring all your drinks with you and come buy some candy apples come on hurry now it is starting wait my hair's not a place is that Nami oh I think that's just a random chick okay let's dance what clear skies these are just random people by the way seems like we won't be able to see a beautiful moon full moon tonight well guess what but you are not boy I guess it's go but guess what girl you're not gonna be seeing no beautiful moves tonight you're gonna be seeing war tonight yeah so I don't think the fire festival is gonna be the final battle but he definitely believed it's gonna be like the first phase of the battle and a pivotal role in the one Oh art I need to stop talking as much let's just go do the chapter and wanna know that season and wanna know the seasons can vary vastly depending on the region and the weather is no exception this means that the climate can be extremely unpredictable also she's saying mostly food for mood tonight not only will you see war tonight you will probably be seen rain and were judged off of that why no country you dogs we a nude are now at the rendezvous point for the final battle crackle so we asked raining and thundering oh we got the night scabbards wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we got seven of seven of the nine scalpers wait issue noble a nice guy friend I just yeah Shinobu let me search that up Shinobu and i know the one piece of wiki isn't only liable but they should be able to know that I don't know why I just like I feel like you know who's probably a nice camper but I just completely forgot let's just hit up the wiki real quick if she what that why did it go to homepage Oh she was in the owner why virtue of the Kazuki Shogunate oh yeah now I remember she's not a knight she's not a nice Gabbard ok sorry let's just get back into this so we got um rise oh not a single ship in sight so that dang cat didn't make it in time right so of course now come on machine yet and then um what's his face I don't know I forgot a saying in Arras he said that we were definitely able to secure him we were definitely able to secure Adan oh so the person of the samurai armor is that dang trap Teague so actually I made a video a while back o'kiku is not a man and it was saying like that people in that time period girls to a dress up as men and say there were men so they could get positions of power but I know this is the way Odin rule is she's definitely a trap but that thing you did get one point 6 K views oh yeah we were definitely able to suit on it's so annoyed even through her day or his whatever even through his dang mask he still looks like a girl his mask literally is a demon mask with teeth and he still looks like a girl but he's owed up I'm still kind of triggered about that you know that I still got it you get about that okay so what this is up Carlebach see that's his name I can't believe my brain is like I just got back from a ton of classes so I like was heavy a Python programming class my brain is all a bit disoriented you know saying but calm others like but none of this order no you know I'm just gonna start from the top of the pages I messed it up so much oh wait I just realized I even skipped a panel what's wrong with me okay so there stay standing in front of the ocean seven of the nine scabbards then we got Shinobu and uh mama no escape behind them and then she no boots like crying and she's like Tiananmen this is the possible then mama no skis like we should change today get him on and can mantra slick then Rises likes not a single ship in sight so that dang cat didn't make it in time we were definitely able to secure it on so they're saying basic units where the dogs people but none of those orders been recruited from the prison they're mine are here either where are our 4,000 soldiers so that's the red-haired lines Gavron who his name also just went out of my mind I can't believe he was such an important part of dressrosa or he was wonderfully back there's I can't believe I forgot it it was okay you know I'm just gonna shirt you read headlines cambrics I'm so bad redhead no [Music] car drove da how could I forget okay but oh yeah let's get anyone this port looks like it may have been attacked the smell has not rung and we cannot contact anyone a twilight of the day of the fire festival at port took our gay this is the promised pour so the name of the doctor why is no one here where did they all go whoa bro she's like boy I knew what you was doing and I decided to mess y'all up he's gonna attack him it has only been one day what happened here they're carrying something he ho he posts what they're carrying some kind of big like Nodine thing not throw anything but you know who's like things that people carry like people carry them and then there's like a small little building room on it like I don't know what the colonies luffy don't know where are you yo Gerudo no please respond must get tears lord oh no cheap cheaper women salukis also disappeared anyone we are here the retainers of the goods of Kazuki Odin after 21 years from the vendor master we were supposed to be seen Bert we were supposed to have been burnt ashes we still came but we cannot do this slow and our enemy has 40,000 troops we needed your assistance please I beg that is enough gentlemen that's uh ash really and then she no boos like girl and I'm moving those gays try not to cry pourcel look at the sky in the sea in front of us even the heavens have turned their backs on us so all will come this is cardrona see I remember his name something worse has happened to them there's no other explanation there's still a small boat here though it looks usable what are you doing in ER Arashi so that's what in Arusha said about the boat stop this foolishness at once so that's what mama knows gets at the inner ah she then ona gosh MA what exactly did Orochi scheme up event a road she's laughing last night an incident occurred and her oh she's with all his like girls and stuff oh what the chap dragon knows only 14 pages usually they're like fifteen or sixteen right what happened to this right this hasn't really happened to more people for because I watch the anime for a long time until I switched the manga in the whole cake island arc but correct me if I'm wrong but there hasn't really ever been a thing where the whole straw hat crew just disappeared and an incident happened to said straw hat crew and we weren't present with them like the straw hats disappearing like even Luffy the freaking main character like it off-screen Luffy disappeared off screen there was a fight with Luffy our screen like a whole fight like the old that was an interesting chapter I give it a 7 out of 10 I like the flashback in the beginning and then I like to help they're just starting to roll the ball slowly roll the ball and so things start just throwing bows the full-steam down I'm kind of excited or not necessarily excited but interested to know what did happen to the straw hat crew since it was all screened but yeah this was my reaction I know it wasn't as crazy as the last one cuz the last one I was just like wow just screaming my head off but yep that's it for this reaction just for my next chapter prediction I think we're kind of getting get an insight on what did happen to try a crew I figure we're probably gonna switch the what's the word switch perspectives to the triack crew we're gonna go do the straw hat crew and leave the nice gabbard's is my prediction so yeah I'm down here uh let's get this back to bow back on because why not we creamed up in here we're cringe so yeah thanks for watching all right I just read the chat Shaz my boy Chaz he says probably hint of a traitor to and yes you right cuz I forgot about the traitor that makes a lot of sense the traitor sold them out cuz well like I know the traitor sold them out to roachie mended traitor probably led them to a place like made it so that it was easier for Orochi to catch catch them on top of just the you know giving them information to Orochi so yeah Shaz thanks for that little insight and yeah thanks for watching if you enjoy my content or

today we are going to livestream on weather but that's already for the new world I myself believe they already but z-boy and Sabo do not think they are ready for the new world so we'll just start this pretty simple Sabo why do you think the straw hats are not ready for the new world well for several reasons mostly because of the way they've like you know won their fights especially like Luffy really you know a lot of his fights he's won but but uh well his fighters like he's always not like you know healthy compared to like you know pre time-skip were like a lot of the battles he fought was like really just like one-on-one battles like you know starting from Michael you know you know he had help yeah it's fine but like um he's shoveling snow oh okay yeah so like um was I saying so like you know what commingle like the myfunc that one was like when he ran out of gear forth and it's like he had all these people to call him helping him and stuff like that you know before he was able to win against a flamingo and then when he was fighting cracker like I don't know laughs I was even if I was a joke and then the whole Luffy versus got a curry thing like he answers shouldn't have won that fight the way it was like portrayed you know yeah and then out of straw hats roofie the only one who's really been pushing himself so I mean maybe luffy's ray first the new world but I compared to everyone else's like oh no cuz I sorrows just been Coulson and Sanji hasn't really done much honestly and then the rest of the straw hats like they've never they haven't really fought anyone of note you know so it's like they're not really getting stronger so true they still have yet to show off their actual strength b-boy you'll conquer with him or do you have anything else to add basically one shot about Kaito I was like no he wasn't ready you know I'm saying it just look good like for one alright Nami is needed like at least one or two freakin power-ups you know post time skip after her training Chomper got beat by a bunch of trees thank you I forgot to add that thank you actually likes energy man but you know I'm saying but Sonia still is like not showing the best negative by some nails you know you know they they need a little extra training any less a little extra roof little Hester poof they like it like they're strong but they still need really to ten with the top tiers yeah so I do you think they're ready for the new world the fact I'll use that was own logic against him in this case Sabo said that none of the other straw hats touch on goofy and sangee in a bit but Sabo said that none of the straw hats have fought anyone of notes which I can the way I view that is because they haven't bought any one of know they're still unknown factors they seem very strong of course Nami she really did only get strong after Zeus she was still strong but this really magnified in a car by then Sanji Sonya is a hard one because it's hard to tell if Sarge II was if Sanji was just weak or if he wasn't trying or if he was just fighting strong guys but when he was fighting guys like daifuku n' oven i think it is noteworthy they're not nowhere but I think it's worthy to note that Sanji when he when he clashed with them briefly he was he did have the upper hand when he was fighting oven it when it was fight and died fuku when he got those clashes he was Virgo no I can't tell virgos strong or fees cuz Virgo didn't seem to be that strong except that he was beating Santi I personally feel like Sonia would it beat him if that kept going on but that could imply or not and now I was Luffy so of course Luffy did have help ride doflamingo the thing with Luffy see does it have stamina pre time skipper so I I see what you mean by leafy same Luffy isn't ready for the new world but I would disagree - somewhat because doflamingo the only reason you would've beat Luffy if you didn't have help from the car - Coliseum people it's because Luffy ran out of gear for when he was in there for he was destroying him and now I know people are like why use the gamma knife stabbed OFI but I really don't find his that same thing with Nami helping defeat I feel they just made it easier for him he still would have won like what though see when dopey got gammon I won he was healing himself I know that was first aid it wasn't complete but if no fee was getting knocked around like that even if he was at full strength he still would have gotten knocked around like that the category fight of course Luffy a bully people will say Luffy using brulee was cheap and category I think of them as equals even if the fight was a bit strange our movies apart and he got lucky category said they were equals so I say he's equal I think ready for the New World and I really cuts on this or anything because all I said done anything let me know okay was alright okay Zhora was ready for the new world he should be like one shot in hawkins okay here's a day their raid that barely sub by the new world like soggy is pretty much the dirt Strong's in the curry I don't care no one said with the trolling or the hate or the logy memes or whatever what we know he's the Daris strongest in a crew discounting djembe and in even steel you know he didn't he did in one shot oven that food and they're not even like the strongest a big moms crew so it begs the question what would happen the straw has where at marine forward like okay so maybe maybe maybe I'll know I I wouldn't be a big fan of all the dusters because I always feel like what may destroy her so great was that they had individual strengths right and then it was like there was like people's like oh man there's such a small crew but they're so strong so I wouldn't like if it was like kind of like where's the straw hats is like well we don't have to get too too strong because we have to pirate fleet to back us up like I would like it like it in this series the straw has just just the straw hats are just so strong the wears like they could basically do a white beer do that marine for you know like beRecruited at marine forward so it if if if it's just a straw hats themselves that we just tell me the straw has themselves and I didn't know at that level um with Luffy he did can defeat category but he also didn't a lot of things played instead and yeah man basically just debt I mean Frankie uh Frankie what a joke post on Scott I'm sorry bro yeah okay many ways go ahead somebody else yes Apple what do you have to say Szabo do you have to say a few hours later oh you know I'm saying oh I'm Szabo you know I'm saying Luke he can't fight sobbing yeah so yeah he's not ready for New World I think Sabol went somewhere when you switch he'll gets back I will say my piece on this straw hat the straw hats as a crew they're stronger than the Don Quixote pirates I don't think that's debatable the Don Quixote pirates are supposedly a new world cruel the straw hats aren't a Janka level crew as the moment but I would say they are in you what they're strong enough to be won't new world crew because the Don Quixote pirates Piku was their third strongest member with their second strongest member and of course Zorro destroyed him and if peak is acceptable as a strong member of the New World I would say that the straw hats also are strong members of the New World that they're strong enough to be part of the New World what do you think about that hmm I mean Zorro he needed help being pika I'm just saying I'm just saying listen he didn't want shot pika mm-hmm but anyways you know like do you think they're gonna train wanna I don't know how that's gonna happen but you know zero dead still he'd be pika nonetheless he still be pika I mean but compare pika - al ki ji Hui dings winning Oh yo Kiki I personally think okay dzongkha level because I believe Sakas MP is anca level now kg BOTS a Kazuki for 10 days so I believe he is nyaka level are close to it so um pika pika he couldn't he's really not that strong but in the eyes the new world he apparently is no no he's not that strong he just says del flu allowed him to just maneuver around and run away for a couple of hours okay yeah yeah and then he can destroy towns but that'll become bigger than a town yes yeah I pick himself I think his weakened in Virgo but uh yeah I would say that I would say I think Burke Virgo could be pika because Virgo is just that strong but cuz we're go he's weaker than doflamingo obviously but he's pretty strong and then the spa and then going into zorro zorro I don't really know how strong it is some people saying stronger than doflamingo I don't really think that doesn't work so a family I know I do not think that I Cesaro is not stronger than till Mingo there was this one person and then of course there's some people I'm pretty sure you've seen them on the BDA discord but some people know genuinely believe they're always stronger than big mom because Charles input a [ __ ] but of course I don't think that but my point is that if the Don Quixote pirates or the Kuja pirates or just okay you're back great but if any of the Pirates the Pirates on the new world like the donkey of the pirates are the Kuja pirates or if any of those parts are acceptable as a new world crew I was in the straw hats already there's no doubt that straw hats are stronger than the DeHart got Don Quixote pirates in my mind that they're insulting but the reason why they've been where they are for like 20-some years they're not strong enough you know right now I got I mean I mean okay that's what I said they're ready to barely survive like in Berlin they're struggling right they are struggling they're struggling to survive in the new world and like I said before if you're all to belief to the straw hat should just be the straw hats do they happen again it wears like they you're supposed to do today it's pretty much like the crew themselves or this will be so should only they don't need a lot of members so right everything about eight people need to be strong enough to like pretty much take over the new world then yeah Jeff Lee they definitely need some some some Tom Chambers some some 20 times gravity some some some fairy tale friendship power of type training oh please no please fairy tales good anime but I would get into that but yeah one I want to backtrack and have a done towards avoid saying so remember when you're talking about you know how nami got Zeus and stuff yes like that's one of my problems like Nami given Zeus and kind of like Sanjay again the rage it's like they haven't even really proved themselves enough to like you know get like extra stuff for power-ups which is my problem it's like oh yeah like Nami God who's us apart was like she hasn't even done anything to show she needed something extra yet same thing with Sanjay he hasn't even really gone all out yet to even really get a power up so it's like were they actually really ready before they came to the new world like you know right maybe they won't leave that's just what it feels like I'm like you know how like I'm black we're supposed to be luffy's rival right yeah go on well because of like how like all those are in the stories like you know I mean I'm like Luffy has some animosity still Torres Blackbeard like because you know Luffy and black bread they are kind of similar you know but obviously like holster extremes to do stuff and I just feel like you know at the end of the I didn't if one piece is gonna be Luffy versus Blackbeard and random black bears Cruz is looking like a little too good for luffy's crew like the only people I can see really like going against his Quran I was like Luffy Zorro Sanji and like Jim Bay of all the other all the other ones I'm just like like what are they gonna do like that's what Wanda was for I was saying I was Eduardo it's where they get stronger where the Bianca level crew and then they can go through the fight said you then they can go against Blackbeard who I know I'm just gonna delve into this first a short digression I think Blackbeard is cosmic the villain but villain like using a Naruto reference he's kinda like Madara but leafy's rival is someone else who I think is kids stories were in this like I get that him and killer rivals but the way is were in is I've like at when it comes down to like who's gonna be our raft so like fighting for the one piece after like is like Luffy and Blackbeard yeah that's what I think Luffy and kid will fight and then get one hey V boy what do you think of this short digression before we get back to the main topic I'm gonna play devil's advocate and I'm going to try to play both sides really the major speech to make this super interesting for the for the side of that they are ready for the new world I mean I mean even before even post even pre time skip they did struggle um I feel like it should be 2 V 2 man where are these people at that we told them it was a penny but I'm this plan even pre times get they did did struggle even backed in and then in his Lobby happen to where is like oh man they really are super duper strong so it could be the case where we just haven't seen everything a they could have they they can do because we already when this floor has worked together they're monsters right like when they sit down and stop getting separated every arc um there there there there they're terminators Darren stop who they defeated pretty almost they they did they just good stuff against or like ORS was like yeah my favorite item one piece yeah backtracking a bit farther back to whether the world is ready for the new world we're saying that he should have been able to one-shot Hawkins I don't think so because Hawkins like we see with Luffy was training and stuff like Hawkins he was actively fighting in the new world for two years he's gonna be pretty strong so I would say zero it's not like it's oral Zorro loading the boat killed Hawkins like two times I think Hawking his lives his lives but how do you guys know nothing much okay so we're talking about whether the straw hats are ready okay we're gonna have to wrap up soon but what are your opinions on it King Oh about well about what whether if this world are there I are they ready for the new world yeah I mean I think they are I mean considering what happened in dress Rosa and stuff like that I think at least solo is Sanjay I would say he's there okay the rest of the crew because think about it you only need me down on the excuse because I'm so sorry you only need to hard to use is really I mean three and we got for hockey uses on a crew counting Issa and the rest of them really know he need hugga there Opie in their own weight by Nami she got home Zeus by come on yes to more than ready Zack is with a store had some work already so yeah I do not complete the last power up power up level so the whole course I don't think I did we would convince the are you can Umbra me both don't you you animate side I don't know if you guys can hear me or not but we're gonna have to end the livestream here for joining Thank You King thank you see boys Thank You Sabo thank you everyone for watching subscribe to change channels subscribe to flavor subscribe to z-boys channel link will be in the description also subscribe to my new MV channel the link will also be in the description thanks for watching", "Vhlhp6KWsiE": "hello everybody buuuut the blue pineapple Phoenix here today I'm doing a livestream about you rude with gonnago who is the two people you see right here slob you and Zachary they share a channel and that link will be in the description and Minerva his link will also be in a description so thanks for being here guys said this is a pleasure this dream is just going to be talking about news so the first thing I wanted to talk about is why do you think aru's left the sky islands as he's a priest there and he's been hinted to have a good amount of influence on the island he was in and you would think he had a good amount of power there so some people say he left the sky islands to hunt down and now some people say he left the sky island just for the regular reason for something more to be a pirate what do you think on that subject he was cause he was afraid over now I mean yeah I know what record so we don't look like you know a very bad month renova yeah one of the worst generation the guy with the epic devil with the epic muscle devil fruit yeah the guy who defeated snack snack snack snack is weight from from the girls crew yeah big mom what is happening so are we just having hard time remember mom is one I mean I do have Alzheimer's [Music] we should we moved off topic I think we need to go back onto a rasp pollutant or whether we're talking about yes so why were so huge I personally think he left the Scylla Islands just to become a pirate and maybe possibly to get stronger than a No maybe they were both from the island of Berk the sky island of birth that's where I know is from maybe they were both there and they didn't like each other or something that's true so maybe he did leave the skylines to go but I think he was just left to become a pirate and to get strong maybe to get stronger than an L for revenge or maybe he was his rival something like that he just got bored maybe well there are those warrior monks but the warrior monks just trained and never used to training maybe you just wanted to this training or something he seems like a pretty chill guy though he seems like crazy and not crazy at the same time like if he gets into a fight he just becomes crazy but if he's not in a fight he's a pretty chill guy I'm thinking maybe she was just thirsty for battle and just went to the new world right folks because because remember on sovaldi archipelago when the pasta Feaster came while most people ran he just went up to her and just fodder until he lost and then when he got to the new world he fought snack and then far cracker until he passed out or until cracker knocked him out rather somehow escaped so very much battle even if he's losing good so anyway someone else might be joining yes for the link but so on the subject of your readers devil fruit and it appears to be a doesn't prove that whenever your ruse gets hit here that changing the strengths he and he hits back with he turns his pain and to strength and hits back which is pretty Overtown well guys it's like it's my best friend King King and now we are getting more people hello King you know who is better talking about is I've got no clue good answer I agree okay anyway so why was i okay we were talking yeah yeah beefy boy Louise yeah so like he's actually it seems like an overpowered because he seems like he turned his strength back if that really was the case that would mean like he could defeat anybody sick I don't just punched him then he would punch back like double what you say that they care for them I'm looking at pictures of him right now and this boy he's quite birth in the in the muscle sure but do you know what else is crazy [Music] what that's not even relevant to me boy come on okay well Minerva what do you what do you think what level do you think beef man's at in terms of power no in terms of his devil feel yeah I don't think it's very good at all I think it's pretty good if you're tanky enough don't think it's like it complete it completely depends on how much you can tank and he seems like the guy to tank things because Oh Hank the pacifist uh he tanked the beat down by cracker he seems like he's like they would either show the boy from from seven deadly sins Oh Mellie oh we show the boy Oh sounds good like you can just either one shot him or just restrain him while he doesn't have the power up that's true with a gun die well probably anyone would die unless oh so you have to factor in hockey if he was a good hockey hits at the time then the bullet bounces off in hockey since Murr OSes that all of the worst generation probably has learned talkie by now did that hockey with his duffel food seems like anyone is a hockey player her sake no but snack definitely could use hockey you know usually if snacks got hockey and your Rouge doesn't have hockey you lose probably isn't gonna get him and since the worst enemy in since you're really since you really a 600 plus million belly bounty because snacks bounty was 16 euros meat snack which means his bounty is gonna be above 600 million that's pretty I feel like if you got about to the high your gun and I have to know hockey I mean he could just be really beefy and out beef his opponents yeah I think all to worship it was kind of implied that the whole worst generation all the supernovas have learned hockey during the time skipping late boys granted but you make a you gotta have hockey like muscle hockey wrong yeah well hockey plus muscle yeah that that was a bit of a weird name but just the heart awesome human strength yay vote sure so poacher right now we're talking about huge and his devil fruit like oh where do you how strong do you think his double food is because I'm kind of at this dance it's a bit overpowered since he converts pain into muscle basically but these guys were pointing out that when he doesn't have to power up he seems like it'd be fairly easy to restrain and at the moment we were debating whether or not he would have hockey I might think in order to be this weak commander you kind of need hockey that is my opinion Bru when it comes to this fruit I don't think it's overpowered because um it's more of an activation type fruit like lawsuit lawsuit can be about if he gets speedy blitzed or hurt before or like he gets tricked in some kind of way his fruit is it passive like goofy so it's like even if he's not paying attention luffy's fruit can sometimes save them bruises in life know if he gives I think his is more blunt and concussive damage we haven't seen him take a lot of deep cuts and if he gets cut you know like in half or something you can't convert that because you did so if he can like right the damage but not be crippled you see what you could just convert and then be crippled then he could be like they were a character from real the gray this manga of all time which you should all go read I agree which manga real re al by taki he going away so check it out okay good yeah Oh bad boy vulture before we move on I want to hear your opinion what was at the beginning of this dream which is huge why did he leave the sky island I thought for all the supernovae the whole their our goal was to be barking well I was devastated or in yeah so I think that's what he wanted he wanted to make a crew yeah like all the supernovae before we really started diving deep into they were all set to be new pirates coming up in the new world trying to be barking like they're all Luffy's competition and it we got more involved in killing all like beige kind of just wanted to at one point just take over other mob bosses or kill powerful people but I don't know if he was ever stated that he wanted to but I think he did was leave hurricane I can't remember but I think well I think that he's like a Rouge wanted to just die in one piece well well the thing is the only thing I was thinking about that was well also though I didn't really seem like he wanted to become a Pirate King but that's beside the point she rude was on the sky island where they didn't even know what rubber was and they didn't know anything about the pirate king or and they knew almost zilch about the world government so how did heroes even find out about the Pirate King maybe he saw multiple people have one Scotland before we don't know a ruse could have some kind of weird backstory where another smaller powered crew crept up to what to call it at one point and maybe talk to him gave him some walk he is and inspire him to go like told maybe pull in the store would go logic Roger being computed a number of reasons kid is like you know who's playing with action figures okay so also on the next point of the stream how strong do you think Girish is and the one bistro cuz he beats NAT but in terms from just the worst generation its warlords Janka like how strong is he probably that's a whole different discussion cuz I am a giant warrior advocate to say the least but not going into that I see what you're saying but I'm not sure well Moria as he is is still fairly strong which is why Blackbird wanted him to join his crew but I'm not sure well I'm not sure Moria at its current stage is gonna be taking on snack cuz you know you no good be snack will or presumed to be snack you think just fighting a ridge and walking away or than Rouge taking it I think it rude is stronger than Sanji not strong maybe not stronger but like I don't think Sanji is beating you're rude especially because of how Santi fights and how you huge fights and we know huge is capable of tanking things and since Jean nd especially blunt force since Santi uses blunt force I don't feel like he's gonna be able go against you for samphire besan G we're talking besan G so he can get hit with the blunt damage with the fire the whole other thing I don't know if you can convert that in that I mean I'd say our version based on G of course didn't close man because of fighting style the utility against damage I kind of played that way Jim like weaker than though flemyng go and backer but since he beat I when they said he beat snack it didn't seem like it was vite down it seems like it was almost like Luffy versus cata curry as in it was a very hard and fairly drawn-out bite so he like huge Isabel yeah not that she drunker than much stronger than him so I think and snack it's kind of unprecedented cuz we know Oh next to nothing about him cuz we know he's weaker than cracker and by default I'd say weaker than doflamingo men but if you stronger than Jim Bay or as strongest Jim Bay or I think Jinbei is a cracker though well in the ocean for sure but on land I mean on land that's some impressive things on lands like so we've been land he on land Jim Bay tanked acai noon when stuff but his destructive force on land Tyson besides in his bag of on drill this most powerful attacks that were actually that were actually are inspiring where him throat doing something related to water well firstly we don't know either mm-hm I think you she's about as strong as Jim baby cuz I know some people say Jim Bay is like hunger than doflamingo and stronger than cracker couple people even say some people say he's stronger than leuf even but not not saying anything about Jim Bay in the ocean but Jim Bay on land I don't think he's stronger than cracker don't feel me I don't think Congress be all right neither strong or any of the other straw hats which says Luffy commander level because Luffy couldn't be any of the commanders by himself so far so I don't know how we give someone lower than Luffy they cycle for commanded what he was able to be commanders during dressrosa I'm some become like commanders and uncle Jocko commanders say okay who did he beat in dressrosa that was he didn't beat dopey by himself uh well the thing is people people say that they say Luffy Oh they say log gamma knife no see and he didn't even have enough but I know if you think about it logically that's um that's what you would think but one piece isn't gonna be devoid of potholes and it was basically stated that at the end of dressrosa goofy was stronger than those familiar where was it stated that he was strong enough not stated but implied and like if you just look at it if I don't think any boy come on that doflamingo is stronger than monkey D Luffy he is strong he fought the weaker than Luffy no blows LT wasn't for it was for law and ten minute time gap that Luffy got because of God's and all them he would have died what do you mean yeah he may have been able to uh no it may not be that effective doflamingo is second commander level that first commander level let me go let me go use my excuse that he because we know he came around with that we know what happened that situation he didn't because straight up there and with cracker to he couldn't be corrected without nominees help period there's a new way around it was smashed to cracker the only problem no no he was not no he couldn't no damn it no in the cracker fight the the only thing crack had on Luffy which he kept keep he was cranking off this order so fast Luffy couldn't completely blitzed him but if he had just found a way to let's past all the crackers before cracker can make another one cracker would have been finished no she words he words if he could in these fights look even look at snake man which is very fast like Luffy it's just of course some people call it plan armor but he can only go through these fights if he gets through the fight and if no one was helping him from all three of those fights doflamingo cracker and kata curry he would have made it through the fight to get doflamingo and open and go people say to me that the birdcage fujitora couldn't cut the birdcage so by default go flamingos like basically just an overpower it's like untouchable guy but the birdcage even though couldn't be cut like the futures tour I wanted to he could have just gone up to doflamingo and destroyed him but you didn't because Luffy had to be him for the sake of the storyline but in and that reinforces the point even more he had to beat him for storyline so now on only did law help him but the story writer helped him by giving him so much dick plot armor that he was carried around the plaza for 10 minutes and he didn't like that that is a weakness 10 minutes of not using hockey isn't a Louise she finds horrible weaknesses with his enemies but for some reason his enemies you know what I'm saying like feast and during those two minutes roofies only weakness really is the fact that gear 4 runs out but now oh it's and two chapters ago I believe it was goofy was using Future Sight that well but Luffy was you you think Future Sight at well which means his Future Sight cuz people were saying it wasn't before but now we know it's the same at scatter curry he can just look in whenever he wants future since it's just like sander Sonia did she didn't have Future Sight she wasn't doing the kind of curry like oh I see this he's gonna say this he has that like thing he'd know he can't see there's a facto future now just knows we can in Tennyson Luffy know Luffy thought in the future because remember new feces West space Mickey was telling making yogoro Luffy was telling he oh grows our paw commands moves three times the head before he did and then he Oh gross said you can see the future and Luffy did not deny it he smiled okay being able to perceive what happened a few seconds later can be classified as seeing the future but what I'm saying is he's not on categories level because he doesn't know what pac-man was gonna say he didn't see a picture of a pocket man swiping love he did what he did on that island with Railly when Railly was when Railly was about to hit him over the head with that Club he dodged that he saw what he was about to do and he got out of the way of it all he's doing is a better version of that to where he doesn't have to sit still or closed his eyes he can just do it now and he'd been in a sense the intent of other people around him but it's until we see him see a picture of the future we can't say it exactly like how to cure it as I'm saying he which is still fire that's still a crazy ability but he's just not as good as kind of carrying that's okay there's one difference well even if he can't see as far as Catco he can't deceive there's one thing if what he said you're saying intent this but sand or Sonia only knew what leaf he was going to do a split second before he did luffy called out Parker Mans moves literally like so he all that means he could see further not that he can see a picture of the future that's what I'm getting at he his his better than Senna Sonia's he just can't see a picture that's the only difference is what someone's gonna say what that person look like who's gonna come up like like say if Luke who's gonna be the tag ten seconds from now cata crew would be able to see oh it's a guy in the blue hat with a long sword all Luffy will be able to do is I'm gonna get a hit in ten seconds let me get out of the way there's a difference there but it's not that much she's here I'm saying blue you mind will you my neighbor this ain't it don't anyway me bro you guys do realize that the intent of the stream with the rose as the me and vulture and z-boy young man yeah we did I feel kind of I mean we should have jump in anyway I mean but wait so they they couldn't handle the hockey class they couldn't okay no they could they could they could but anyway I was about to go in people would tell us about your Rouge theories if you have any theories uh I strongly think he is all that stuff if if he could be judged since judge be snacking the roots beats knife I mean a snack did I mean it's nice slipped into a banana peel we all know that Wow so I even even this seen an anime didn't convince you and he was you know surrounded by destroyed environments and stuff ruse out here doing work damn man ain't maintaining but is it you know expound upon blue Canyon now in all seriousness I think a rude he's probably strong I think he might be a little overrated though because I mean he is if he was on a straw hair crew where would he ranked Frankie Lowe maybe not bro-bro snack because he has a 600 million belly bounty and because you'd be him people and since he's hinted to be the weakest Yakima commander of the big mom crew they just assume he's trash but like no Frankie is interested but he's wishers and roasting Robin and wanky which I do not buy into life lady shakes he has a devil no Brooke is not trunk in the freaky if Brooke what is Brooke going to do to Frankie besides just try and I slash him and the ice and the so Brook can't even cut Frankie most likely they can freeze him and spin play he could freeze you this radical being or something how you gonna do that when you're frozen though because Frankie is literally Vega Baker Punk cyborg if they can't handle a little freezing you don't know how powerful Brookes freezing is per se so I'll give you that but I mean it's not trash I'm pretty sure you can freeze metal like what you think he can't freeze metal and then you know what's metals frozen or heated up to a certain point it breaks easier hey Rob hey guys rahrr grew it and stuff left because he had to go to work not because he couldn't handle the hot splash again anyway so I'm thinking he's like if I'm thinking he's about equal to Sanji so okay are you one of the people that say sandy is the third strongest in that ty woods aura nothing it's a different story in djembe is definitely stronger than bass Sanji but sorry face donkey make it definitely hmm but bass Sanji I'm thinking that cuz Jim bass bounty is four hundred million but I think he could Fett is seven hundred million do you agree around a million yeah yeah I think he could be about that because I think he's like stronger I won't give birth to him because he has been a sheshe Buca and then we broke up I read and he's associated with Luffy so I feel like his connections more than his raw physical ability to do harm to the government it just the thing the thing we haven't seen the true side of Jim because what Jim Bay's Forte will be like in the sea he's probably the he's the strongest fisherman basically and if he's in the ocean we don't know what he can do and what the fisherman pirates do as we go under boats and completely you wreck them like djembe can tour tear a giant hole through a ship with a giant sea torrent but like Ramallah that's more Dziedzic put a like weak point like no no I'm saying like in the water you ate a lot of people could do stuff to the ship I'll give white beer or something like Carrie booth came up from under you on the ship and was like throwing missiles at you he could destroy a ship well the ship wasn't the point the point was that Jim Bay Ken like manipulate the ocean underwater and that could and it's like it's bounty based solely on strength well probably I don't think that's that impressive in comparison to a lot of other people though I feel like if we talking about his bounty 700 million that were asked a question how much evenings oral should be ah the well I mean mmm because he he his didn't move after okay great or something like that not okay but like when the bounties went up his and really go up that much Zoro is almost kinda I remember when you know I don't know what I think of all because and by the way guys let's just completely ditch the whole huge discussion because we're gonna keep getting sidetracked let's just we should I think 100 yeah so Xaro he's kind of cuz I was I don't think of them cuz people were saying he's like stronger than doflamingo which I wasn't really giving him I was like at best with a gigantic stretch he is a strongest doflamingo and that would be trash writing by Oda Zorro and oh but then mister because um oh sorry good but then they give you is more like a it's Jim bear bit stronger but then he got one shot by commas oh and it's not what commas Oh is weak but seriously hmm it's a tough way is it tougher because uh I don't see commas Oh being some secret badass that we now have to start putting in top 30 streams like a tweet like we find out that commas oh here's some like the note he was like the number-two guy or some [ __ ] for like a long time I don't think that's gonna happen so Zorro getting hit with that sword really does kind of I think the same way Luffy is trying to find a way to be trying to be Kaito Zhou was trying to find a way to kind of give himself more of a durability against other swordsmen and [ __ ] like that hit him getting cut like kind of opened his eyes and now he's gonna be working on his own like me like maybe Zorro finds a way to approach that the full body armor hockey in a different way than move he is like Luffy's going after grandpa yo and asking him you know how do I do this I'm trying to punch somebody without punching him and he's always trying to find a way to like actually have a pseudo armor on him during battle almost like big mom you know okay I think if he was would be able to do something like that enough his durability he would definitely I think he would definitely be over it but yeah I've been meaning at so y'all gonna do a y'all top Barry together I haven't thought about Luke we can oh yeah cuz a man means I'll be a promoter at the end like yeah you want to see they part to go check out their channels you obviously haven't yeah yeah a pardon but know this like there's our done we haven't done our yet if you want to again if we if you just want to start over and do a whole new one now just ask me of y'all y'all doing it oh yeah well I was talking to blue trying to see what he wanted if we can I'm down if not then whatever we can talk about it after the stream ends which sadly we'll have to end about now because I have some duties that are calling me so thanks for watching everyone if you enjoy my content and only if you draw my Conte like this video subscribe and turn on

Internet of Things on the horizon the strain on mobile networks and budgets is tougher than ever traditional macro sites are not enough to deliver the necessary indoor coverage let alone capacity on top of that operator licensed frequencies are a scarce resource so even if they do manage to penetrate inside buildings macro sites simply do not have the bandwidth or link budget to satisfy demand even with most small cell architectures today smartphones only connect to one cell at a time using limited licensed band frequencies furthermore traditional Dass architectures only provide added

it's a little bit different than the normal oneplus phones we've been seeing [Music] deviating from the gradual price increases we usually see they've brought it back down to a pretty fair 400 euros which is about 460 dollars right now if they were being sold in the united states which it's not i'm a huge fan of the color inside the box underneath the welcome letter is a free soft clear rubber case with a frosted diamond design on the back probably going along with that north compass theme that the name nord is based on and it's even got a cool little water resistant plug flappy thing for the charging port extra protection is always a good thing going deeper we have the 30 watt european warp charging brick i'm not sure why oneplus isn't selling the door to here in the usa it's kind of like they're avoiding the united states like we have the plague or something oh oh yeah i think my favorite part of the new nord phone though is its case selection oneplus teamed up with dbrand and i to make a custom oneplus case for the nord with a blue battery that matches pretty darn well with the blue glass this video isn't sponsored by the way and i wasn't paid anything for helping them out with the case design nor do i get any commission from the sales of the case it's just a fun little project between friends and i think it turned out pretty well i'll leave a link down in the description if you want to snag one for yourself anyway let's get started [Music] [Applause] [Music] if cases aren't your thing of course we still do have the regular tear down skin same transparent design in a sleeker form factor but also without that drop protection personally i think the skin looks pretty cool under that clear rubber case as well it's pretty awesome of oneplus to let us be involved in the design process now we know the oneplus nord is a cheaper phone this time around and to get that lower price point sacrifices do have to be made sometimes even sacrifices to durability [Music] lucky for us oneplus has included a free screen protector on the display i'll peel that off so we can start with the actual scratch test remember these mohs picks help us differentiate between plastic which scratches at level 2 or 3 and glass which scratches at a 5 or a 6 and of course sapphire which is level 8 or 9. the oneplus nord is using gorilla glass 5 which starts scratching at level 6 with deeper crews at a level 7. i think this robin's egg blue is one of the most eye-catching colors we've seen this year there are two cameras on the front a 32 megapixel regular selfie camera and an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle where you can fit more people in you know for when it's safe to take selfies in groups again which for the rest of the civilized world is right about now and in the usa it might be next year there is a nice little black plastic buffer layer between the front glass and the frame of the phone always good to see this kind of cushions the glass a little more than metal wood if it's ever dropped and it makes excellent curlicues speaking of metal though this oneplus nord does not have a metal frame the frame has the silvery shine of anodized metal but it's actually just paint over plastic you can see my razor blade carved chunks out of the lower portion of the phone leaving the black plastic exposed not necessarily a deal breaker of course we just haven't seen a plastic phone in quite a while the volume rocker is made from metal you can see the silver shining through from underneath my scratches making a phone out of plastic does save money i think oneplus just decided to use the nord budget to improve the internals of the phone rather than the externals the sim card tray is also made from plastic and does still include the water resistant rubber ring around the opening the right side of the phone is also plastic with a metal power button and a metal mute switch which i'm still a huge fan of and up at the top more plastic the back of the phone is glass my razer blade does no damage and the logos are safe on the underside of that glass oneplus is calling this a quad camera setup with a 48 megapixel main camera stolen from the oneplus 8. there is also an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle camera and a 5 megapixel depth camera along with a 2 megapixel macro camera down at the very bottom it's always nice to have options and they're all protected under the scratch-resistant glass speaking of glass under the front slab is a 6.4 inch 1080p display with a 90 hertz refresh rate which is a nice improvement over the normal phones with their 60 hertz and we can see from the screen going white after about 25 seconds and never fully recovering that the display is amoled testing out the under screen fingerprint scanner also a perk for a phone this price we can tell it's an optical scanner by the way the screen lights up to illuminate my fingerprint through the glass ultrasonic fingerprint readers like on the samsung phones don't need this extra light after adding some level 7 deeper groove damages my fingerprint is still able to be read and unlock the phone every single time nice work oneplus gets a thumbs up from me even though my hands are still covered in that glitter paint now remember smartphone durability isn't everything it's just one of the many aspects to consider when buying a phone a good protective case can solve many structural issues and the oneplus nord does have some structural issues nothing major happens with the first bin from the back even though the phone was left a little kinked it's only when bending from the front that we hear the first snap i try not to get spooked when my phone cracks but i am only human it turns out it was the frame near the volume button and once that last shred of structure was gone the rest of the screen was soon to follow the interesting thing to note here though is that the entire phone is still mostly fine the exterior glass is not cracked at all on both the front and back surfaces it's just the interior display underneath the glass that's broken cracked like a potato chip or a robin's egg the gorilla glass on the outside of the phone is still undamaged and unshattered i actually saw something similar to this happen on a 5 000 tv one time but that's a different story for a different day the oneplus nord is not going to break all on its own of course the amount of stress i put on phones isn't normal by any means but the nord should indeed try to stay out of extreme situations and avoid back pockets most phones that pass through my tests do not end up breaking a hard case is always a good idea no matter what phone you own and with this oneplus nord i'd say hardcase is probably a great idea remember this video only focuses on the durability aspect of the phone and even though the oneplus nord failed my durability test it still is a good phone like i said before durability is only one aspect to consider but like always let me know your thoughts down in the comments we'll dive deeper into the phone during the teardown video so come hang out with me on instagram and twitter and thanks a ton for watching i'll see you around", "qLvIHMQyEPI":

surgeon a teacher and a healthcare futurist today there aren't enough healthcare resources to meet the world's needs we know that about two-thirds of the world's population about five billion people don't really have access to safe surgery or to affordable surgery we need to really use the technology that we have at hand like 5g to shorten that gap between what we can offer and what we need to offer the clarity of high definition video in 5g will make telehealth experiences more comfortable and accurate for rural and remote patients as a surgeon the more i can see the better my diagnosis 5g connected wearables will facilitate streaming of real-time data they can monitor how much you are active or your heart rate or even your blood pressure with the touch of a button the use of virtual

allow us to have a real life conversation but at a distance we know that 80 percent of people with healthcare questions don't need the physical contact with the provider in order to be successfully advised or treated remote surgery using semi-autonomous robots will be feasible so will the use of ai and deep learning to analyze ct scans mris x-rays and other imaging studies to vastly improve our

point of this video is for you guys to see them in under different lighting conditions so as you can see here everything is a little bit washed out we have the silver pacific blue the gold and the graphite right here and let's go ahead and start off here with the blue so you can see that there again this is the pacific blue definitely quite a bit different to the blue that you have with the iphone 12 which is much deeper much of more of an actual actual blue this is definitely more of an aqua like oceanic blue and apple does portray that on their website i really do like the way that it looks i'm a fan if i would have gone for this instead of the graphite i would have been happy i don't think i would have exchanged it but i wanted graphite last year after i saw it because i realized how much more i liked it than the midnight green so i'm glad i got the graphite just because it's a more neutral color it's going to match with more cases and more of the things that i own but this blue is really an incredible looking color you can see the sides there worth noting that on all these colors this year the sides are a little bit more reflective than last year for some reason they also feel a little bit sleeker i don't know it's a little bit different but there is a lot more reflection looks more like jewelry this time around more so than this and i think maybe it's just due to the fact that it's flat instead of curved so you get a different reflection on here that's probably it good news is that all the colors have been reworked slightly so all my complaints from last year are basically gone last year i spoke a lot about how the white didn't look like white or like silver this year definitely looks a little bit more like white and it just looks really really good they've kind of changed the matte finish on the back of these and they all look a little bit better this year than they did they kind of just refined this matte material that they've been working on here on the back and if you like white phones or silver phones this is probably going to be your favorite one in a long time it looks really great so if we see here the iphone 10s i had this one back then i hated it you can see that that cloudiness is kind of gone see that cloudiness it looks almost like grayish and it's very dull it's kind of gone it's much brighter now it's much cleaner and nicer and it's gonna look better in cases so i'm a fan of this white one or silver this year i do really like it in previous years i've always gotten the gold one in the max model because it's the size i like the least with the color i like the least that's not true of the gold this year it's a little bit more toned down here there's some nice pink hues to this back the gold on the sides looks lovely i think it's a very nice tone of gold it actually almost looks like gold gold so it looks really nice the black and gold with the screen here on the front looks real good and overall they have kind of basically perfected this tone of color that they've been going over the past couple of years and i think people that have liked the gold phones over the past couple years are gonna really like this one i still for me find the iphone i believe seven though with the aluminum back the gold one to be the best gold phone they've made with the white front i thought that one was just great and this one is now the second best one that they've made i really do like this one i wouldn't mind actually using this and buying this one uh it just looks good it looks really really good as far as the graphite one it does look very similar to last year not many changes there but we do get those glossier sides flat and overall this does feel a little bit better than it did last year so i think if you like something that's very inconspicuous it's not going to bring too much attention this is the way to go that's why i went with this this year it also matches with a lot more cases same thing goes for the white one they just match more cases due to the fact that there's just kind of a neutral color so you can you know put a skin on this put a black case on this and it's going to matte it out not bring too much attention but if you get it and put it on one of the other ones then of course you're going to get nice um accents and stuff around the devices so here we put it on the gold one you're gonna be able to see the gold there let's go ahead and show you the blue one right there you can see that there and of course i have tons of cases and stuff um to show y'all and i'll be showing b-roll of how these devices look in different lighting conditions but i think the point is here there's no bad color at least on the pro line of devices on the 11 or the normal 12 i do not like the white one because you can see that there it looks a little odd doesn't it if you compare it here to the 12 pro it has some pinkish shoes and stuff that just make it not white and it almost resembles more of like a color in between the silver and the gold maybe a good thing if that's what you're looking for but if you're looking for white i don't think that the normal 12 is the way to go now how does the leather case look on these maybe you can kind of see it there if i just kind of run them over real quick um they all look really good i mean all these devices the fact that the stainless steel size the colors are kind of toned down they don't pop too much kind of like the iphone 12 blue here you can see how much more that pops so it makes a little bit harder to match with cases and stuff that's something to keep in mind a stuff to get the red i think and then the yellow or pink tomorrow or no actually green tomorrow because those did not show up here today but you can see these let's go ahead and grab them all carefully because i do not want to scratch any of these and now you can see all the boxes there for the devices very cool all the accents and everything around there the new wallpapers here we take a closer look at them you can see them all in their glory right there you can see that all the colors are nicely toned down they look really great the white one of course is going to show those lenses the most you know they have a lot of contrast you can see the lidar sensor right there the blue one honestly blends everything in quite nicely i would say as far as you know showing the cameras you got the uh white one or the silver first then it would be the gold then the blue then the graphite kind of hides them the best um but both the graphite and blue do a good job of kind of just mixing that all in nicely i'm moving things around very slowly because if those camera bumps touch the front of another device's screen they will most likely scratch like they have in previous years even though this does have supposedly a stronger screen compared to the previous devices now here is just so you guys can see it from the front i always get a ton of comments and a bunch of people that say like we didn't get to see it from the front well let me grab them here from the front and show you there so you can see that there there you go you can see the aluminum or the stainless steel here a lot on the silver the blue you really can't see much the gold you can kind of see the gold peeking through and the graphite a little bit as well none of these are really gonna um hide as much or show as much i guess as the 12 because these have right here the aluminum so here on the black it's basically matted out so you don't see any reflection or anything here on the front like you do on these right here but you can kind of see there how they look i put that back they all look really really great i mean again it really is like jewelry these are very nicely designed devices whatever color you go for you're gonna be very happy with them the size is great i think 6.1 inches is great for most people of course we will be getting the 12 mini in november so we'll be checking that out to see because that smaller screen is definitely going to be good for people that like the se and all that but again this is the iphone 12 pro in all of the colors let me know what color you guys are gonna get i'll definitely be sticking with this graphite color my brother actually got the pacific blue color and uh yeah looking forward to using these devices checking them out more if you have any questions feel free to comment below please do check out the videos on the channel and i will catch you guys in the next one goodbye", "TdDgFHfqhso":

For the third year running,\nQualcomm flew me to Hawaii for the annual Snapdragon summit, where, for the third year running, the next-generation smartphone and laptop chips were announced, and a parade of executives\nproclaimed that 5G is here. But this year is different, because it's actually true. On December 6th, T-Mobile made it official by flipping the switch on a\nnationwide deployment of 5G that covers 200 million people. But what does that really mean? And more importantly,\nshould you care enough to spend money on it? Well I took a 5G phone for a\nMaui test drive to find out. (electronic music) 5G can be confusing because\nit's not a single technology. It can mean different things depending, mostly on what carrier you use. Take Verizon. The 5G network that it's\npushing the hardest, is built brand-new, from the ground up. And it delivers the kind\nof incredible data speeds that let you download a whole season of a TV show in minutes. You can learn more about\nthat network in my Chicago and Providence 5G test drive videos, which will also show\nyou just how unimpressed I was with them. The reason? To reach those crazy data speeds, network and phone need to\noperate at very high frequencies, called high band, or millimeter wave. And those waves can't\npenetrate obstacles very well. Lemme illustrate what that\nmeans with a real-world example. Remember when Verizon said this week that it was the first carrier\nto deploy 5G on a beach? - [Presenter] To have 5G on a beach? Just go right outside. - Our search for millimeter\nwave reception has brought us to the kiddie pool. I'm not happy about it. I went to that beach with\nThe Unlockr's David Cogen, whose borrowed Samsung\nreview unit did indeed latch on to the signal from\none of the two 5G nodes on the roof of the resort here. And, did we get amazing speeds? Absolutely. But, to get them, we had to hold still. Putting anything between us and that node, palm trees, umbrellas, our own bodies, would interrupt the signal. Hmmm.\n- Hmm, sad. - Hmm, millimeter wave, everybody. Now T-Mobile had some fun with that reality with the coverage maps that handed out with\nour phones here on Maui. This is T-Mobile's asserted\n5G coverage in Hawaii. And um, this, is Verizon's. Corporate shade, gotta love it. So then why was the\nU.S.'s second smallest, nationwide carrier able to flip a switch and suddenly claim 5G coverage\nover 200 million people? Well, because again, 5G\nisn't just one thing. While Verizon emphasizes\nits 5G build out way up in the millimeter wave\nspectrum at 28-39 gigahertz, T-Mobile's nationwide focus\nis way down the scale, at 600 megahertz. In terms of cellular communications, that's some of the lowest\ndown real estate you can get, which is great for penetrating walls and keeping you connected, even indoors. The minute I powered up my OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren review device, I had a solid 5G connection\nthat barely wavered as I meandered all over the resort. 5G, hello! See, just like Verizon, T-Mobile had a 5G cell\nsite right on the roof. So I took an Uber to the\nneighboring town of Kihei, little ways up the coast, to\nsee how the signal held up in as close to the real\nworld as I could get. And while the McLaren did\noccasionally fall back to 4G as it connected to cell sites that haven't yet been upgraded, more often than not, when I\nlooked up at the status bar, it was a 5G indicator glowing back at me. So what's the catch? Well, the same 600 megahertz radio waves that are so great at penetrating walls, are not so great at giving\nyou fast data speeds. Even T-Mobile itself\nestimates only an average of 20% faster download\nspeeds on its low-band 5G, compared to its 4G network. And in my testing\nalongside Andrew Martonik's 4G T-Mobile phone, well,\nsometimes 5G was faster. And, sometimes not. I put the phone to some\nreal-world use tests, like downloading Spotify playlists and sure enough, it didn't\nreally feel all that different. These are just download\nspeeds, by the way. Upload speeds were always lower than on a comparable 4G phone. And due to a firmware issue that won't be addressed until 2020, mobile hotspot still works over 4G. So, if you're like me and you have visions\nof pairing your laptop to your superfast 5G phone and uploading big files\nfrom the road, well, give it some time. My initial conclusion on T-Mobile 5G and the McLaren OnePlus 7T Pro after a quick word from my sponsor. If you use free public WiFi a lot, your data bill is probably in good shape. But, your security might not be. That's why you should\nencrypt your connection with a VPN like today's sponsor.

So today, 5G is kind of\na choose-your-pain game. Millimeter wave offers\nbursts of incredible speed in a handful of tiny areas, while lowband offers great coverage, but speeds that kinda feel like 4G. Now, this doesn't mean\nthat 5G is vaporware. When it's ready, it really\nis going to enable a whole new generation of connected devices, and it'll help solve\nmany of the congestion and speed issues we're\nseeing on today's networks. But, getting to that future is going to be immensely complicated. It's one of the biggest reasons T-Mobile has so aggressively pursued\na merger with Sprint. Only by combining their spectrum holdings can they build out the necessary coverage across low, mid, and high bands to give us a real 5G\nexperience that matters. I'm generally against mergers\nthat decrease competition, and I fully expect prices to go up once this one inevitably goes through. But I can kinda see their argument. And speaking of money,\nwhile you don't have to pay more per month to use T-Mobile 5G, you'll need to drop $900 on this McLaren edition OnePlus 7T Pro, or $1,300 on the Galaxy\nNote 10+ 5G to use it. Each represents about a $2-300 premium over its non-5G equivalent. I'll be doing some more\ntesting on T-Mobile's 5G network in New York next week, and sharing impressions on my Instagram and Twitter channels, stay tuned for that. But, from what I've seen so far in Maui, my conclusion seems unlikely to change. 5G might technically be here, but it's not worth you\nspending more money on it. Not yet. This video was produced at the 2019 Snapdragon Summit in Maui, and Qualcomm provided travel, lodging, and meals to some members of the media, including Mr. Mobile. T-Mobile also, provided the\nOnePlus 7T Pro McLaren edition review sample on a one-week loan basis. And neither company was offered an early look at this content, or copy approval, though, that means they're seeing\nit for the first time right alongside you. Please subscribe to theMrMobile on YouTube if that's the kind of video\nyou'd like to see more of. Until next time, thanks for watching! And stay mobile my friends.", "kMbKGpsatB0": "[Music] Dameon oh here at Mobile World Congress Barcelona this week we've heard a lot about 5g it really looks like the whole ecosystem is coalescing as operators moved to commercializing these networks at scale I'm curious to learn from you how air span is approaching 5g so this week we made a lot of 5g announcements we are launched our air 5g open architecture vrn platform which supports millimeter wave and sub 6 gigahertz with massive MIMO so we're providing macro performance high-power 70 DBM multiple splits split to split six split 7 and we're providing an open interface and I'm opening ecosystem so that operators can choose what software to put it in into their network and be our software it could be a third parties but we're trying to disrupt the way the economics of networks get deployed and that's something we have a you know in the last two years have really succeeded at doing which is transforming the economics of network deployments and you know you mentioned 5g relay this is a really important piece of the equation here so what's the approach in that regardless so five g 5g relay is the continuation of our great success with solutions like magic box so we're 5g back relay back haul will allow operators to densify their network with 5g connections there's a long runway still on 4G there's a lot of talk in terms of the the ecosystem coalescing but there's going to be a time frame where operators can start deploying 5g backhaul and with 4G access and start to take advantage of the large ecosystem of 4G devices that can benefit from a large pipe and low latency and improve the overall user experience so the you know we talked about how we transform the network economics of how cells get deployed that's a great application because you're moving boxes into the network via FedEx instead of via truck roll and so you know it's it's integrating the the backhaul solving the zoning the power these are these are the the key concepts that need to be addressed in order for an operator to truly scale and we've done that really well with magic box we have world leaders and strand mounted strand mounted base stations tens of thousands of units deployed last year and compared to traditional outdoor infrastructure that is three to four times faster than anything comparable so it sounds like you give a lot of flexibility to your operator customers with your portfolio yes absolutely so you know we we cover everything from small cell to macro various zoning form factors as I mentioned strand mount we have pole mounted base stations we have flexible gear on where the brand the ran unit is is distributed it can be a split of that distributed and centralized so we are offering the full gambit of a 5g network densification provider well Jamie I know I appreciate you catching us up on what air span is doing to serve the operator needs as they scale out 5g thank you you",

they try to deliver really good performance for a reasonable price now before we get into pricing and all the details of these things the thing i needed to know right when i got this package was not what the phone would look like even though it's a little bit different from the renders it was important but even more important was the color of the charging cable i was so convinced that they would deliver a blue charging cable because all the marketing material on oneplus nord was blue and it comes in like this a red one this won't do we gotta fix this that's right that's the way it should be okay oneplus nord comes in two colors this one here is blue marble uh it's this bright blue it's unfortunately not called dave 2d teal it's not even teal anyways it's definitely bluer than teal but it's a pretty nice color it does have a gloss finish though we've been treated some really nice satin finished oneplus phones over the past little bit like the oneplus 8 and the oneplus 8 pro these have that kind of textured glass material this is smooth glass it's a little bit more reflective and fingerprints and smudges will show more readily on this material versus the satin finish phones but it's a nice color and the other variant the gray onyx version is the same kind of finish also a smooth glass back in europe it starts at 399 depending on the region that you're picking it up in you have to look up the pricing but this feels like a appropriately priced phone with eight gigs of ram at the bottom end 128 gigs of storage it's well equipped to have a really fast and smooth phone experience the display panel is a 90hz amoled panel it's hard to portray in videos so it's something you just have to experience but for some people that are sensitive to it and appreciate it it is a more fluid visual experience the processor in here snapdragon 765g it's 5g capable if that matters to you and it feels weirdly fast like snapdragon 700 series chips are never particularly performance focused not that this one is like the fastest thing out there but it definitely feels like it keeps up with 800 series phones like if you put this beside the oneplus 8 pro you can tell that the 8 pro is the faster one for sure but this keeps up it just feels fast now the difference between this chip and something like the snapdragon 865 is primarily going to be when you're playing 3d games or basically graphically intense applications which means you probably won't care that much considering the price point now i noticed in the box it included a case uh this is just like a plain rubber i think it's rubber case that fits on the back of it but one thing i noticed is that the usb-c port has this plug that you can just close up the port with but the oneplus nord itself is not officially water resistant so it's nice that they include a case with this usbc plug to keep that water out okay the speaker notice how i use the singular of that word not speakers but speaker it's a mono speaker on the bottom and it's loud but man it is so noticeable to come from stereo speakers back to a mono speaker phone it's just weird but that's what you get 400 bucks the in-display fingerprint sensor is pretty fast and it's got your alert slider on the side which is very classically one plus i was worried that they would remove this because some of the earlier renders didn't have it but it's here alert slider on the oneplus nord you also get fast 30 watt warp charging with this awesome teal cable that they don't include and up front there's two focal lengths for the selfie cam a wide and a regular all right let's talk about the camera so this is a triple camera system well it's four lenses but the fourth one is a depth sensor now the main sensor uses the same hardware as the oneplus 8 so i'd expect good photos nothing amazing but again considering the price on this thing i'm happy with it i'm actually surprised that they were using this sensor like i feel like at this price point they had to lower it like if you consider the difference between these phones now like the oneplus 8 and the oneplus nord especially because those camera systems are so similar it's tough right i think for a purchase decision the oneplus nord looks really attractive but i'll be doing a proper examination of camera system in my full review of this phone but the overall take of this phone like an early impression of it is that it's really good like it feels nice in your hand doesn't have the curved edges on the glass good weight good size big battery 40 100 milliamp hours a little bit bigger than that it's just it's a solid phone for the money now i want to move off this phone to what i feel like is the more interesting conversation to be had the cable no let's talk about the oneplus buds when i looked at these two products the first one that came to mind was like i want to do a in-depth kind of analysis of these things and then i was thinking of bringing like all the earbuds that i have but the moment you open these you'll realize that there's only one product out there that oneplus was trying to outdo there's only one competitor one real competitor to the oneplus buds it's this 160 dollar air pods from apple now this is also a very basic wireless earbud like they both don't have active noise cancellation they both don't have foam or rubber ear tips for like comfort and fit they're just really simple wireless earbuds really basic and they both have hard tips like hard plastics for the tip now this is something that is very divisive some people love this type of fit some people hate it right it's like chocolate and vanilla everyone's got a preference but there's no rhyme or reason as to which one you like some people like hard tips some people don't if you're someone who hates hard tip ear buds because they don't fit in your ear or you don't like the sound of it then you should just close off this video and leave a thumbs up anyways on your way out but for the people that do like this i'm one of them i'm one of the people that enjoy hard tipped earbuds you want to pay attention because these i think are very interesting products let's talk about sound first so i spent a stupid amount of time trying to discern the differences between the airpods and the oneplus buds they are very similar in terms of sound quality now that them are particularly amazing they're both mediocre right now these have great audio but that's not the point here we're going for convenience but they sound very similar and this is 80 this is 160 it's tough to do comparisons when one product is half the price of the other now with the apple air pods these things are just extremely reliable they're very convenient and they're very easy to pair and stuff like that but the reliability is what really sticks out to me it doesn't drop out it's just a rock solid connection that anyone can appreciate the one plus buds i've only had these for a week and you know two three charge cycles but it feels solid no bluetooth dropouts really easy to connect to a oneplus device and easy to switch between devices even laptops it just feels like a solid overall product and really well worth the 80 so my initial impression when i saw this product was like okay it's an inexpensive earbud doesn't have wireless charging doesn't have all the bells and whistles the first thing i thought like the knee-jerk reaction was this is a money grab this is oneplus taking some product off of alibaba and like rebranding it with a oneplus logo but having used this for a little bit i don't think so i legitimately think that this is a solid product i don't know how this will be long term right this is relatively early in the product launch cycle i don't know how the battery will last that's another thing i want to get into because like earpods these are 160 bucks when these things are like 8 10 months of regular use you start to notice the decrease in battery life the oneplus buds support some form of fast charging not like you know warp charge pumping 30 watts into this thing it's not that fast but it is fast enough that you can get 10 hours of use with just 10 minutes of charging it's cool right it's very fast but what's that gonna look like down the line like if i fast charge this thing every day for eight months 10 months 12 months a year from now what is this battery life going to look like i don't have the data for that i don't think anybody does but in its current state i highly recommend it i think it's a fantastic sounding earbud it's just i don't know about long-term use now in terms of the mic quality they're also very similar i'll just play some sound samples let me explain to you as to why teal is the best color on the planet simply it's just not red i have a hair dryer going on in the background right now so you should be able to tell the difference in noise cancellation between the two different mics so you get seven hours of battery life on a charge and when you're done with the pods and they're depleted you can stick it back into the case it juices it back up and you get a total of 30 hours if you have a fully charged uh oneplus but now i i plugged it up to a regular usbc charger it takes about an hour and a half to charge this thing from zero to full that's with everything depleted right the earbuds and the case being at zero an hour and a half to juice it back up and that gives you 30 hours of use that's a lot of numbers a lot of math going on but hope it's clear but i like the one plus buds i really do i just i wish i had long-term data for this video so that you guys could get a uh like a better picture of the product overall now just some closing thoughts on oneplus launch for today the oneplus nord and the oneplus buds are they're kind of like middle of the road products right mid-tier stuff not super high-end not super expensive but one of the one of the comments that i often see when it comes to people who dislike the brand and it's totally fine to you know not like oneplus but one of the comments i often see is this idea that you know oneplus has mediocre products with really good marketing especially from youtubers and i get that i do feel like they do their marketing differently from like let's say samsung but i will say the one thing that oneplus does well and it's present in both of these products is their software it's clean like you see the oneplus nord very clean software just like all the regular oneplus phones but you can also see that like dna of clean software in this product this is a product that is so easy to screw up it's so easy to make these bad wireless earpods they're everywhere check amazon there's like 500 of them ready to be sold to you but they did it right they did it in a manner that i feel like is it's one plus they did they didn't disappoint so that's that's my early impression on this stuff hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it i'll see you guys next time", "zaWisTu_aL8": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] me [Music]", "-QTUn0qbdaI": "this video is brought to you by squarespace what's up guys it's time to unveil the surprising truth of the galaxy s20 fe compared to the galaxy s30 series this phone although it's being marketed as the phone for fans it's clearly a drastic move to improve the sales of the galaxy s20 lineup which in case you don't know fell down about 59 compared to the last year's galaxy s10 series now the first obvious win for the galaxy s20 fe is that it's a lot cheaper compared to the s20 lineup s20 fe 5g model cost 699 that's almost 300 cheaper than the starting price of the s20 lineup which starts at 1 000 if you actually go with the 4g exynos 990 lte model of the s20 fe that model is even more cheaper coming at 600 apart from the price there's actually a huge advantage for buying the galaxy s20 fe compared to the s20 and note 20 series if you're in the uk or europe or basically in any non-us country that has 5g you still get exynos 990 with the s20 series or note 20 series despite paying all that 5g premium price but the s20 fe 5g gives you qualcomm 865 no matter where you are in the world so that means 5g markets where normally we have exynos models the s20 fe is bringing qualcomm 865 and it's a huge deal for anyone who's looking to score a better chip and that probably has slightly better battery faster benchmark scores and of course uh smoother gaming performance as we have seen in the comparison side by side with the qualcomm and xness chips i think this alone will be a huge reason to just go for the s20 fe save money and you're getting qualcomm that's amazing now to be fair samsung is bringing the exinus 990 model almost 100 cheaper honestly in my opinion at this price point processor difference really doesn't matter but if that is something important to you then do know that you get qualcomm on all s20 fe 5g models now before getting my hands on the s20 fe the thought about this phone was that this one should have been launched early with the galaxy s20 series on the unpacked day back in february because the standard s20 which was initially thousand dollars can now be attained for a much cheaper price again it depends on your market and make no mistake the galaxy s20 series is far more premium than the s20 fe with a higher gorilla glass 6 edge display a better glass body but wait here is where things get interesting the s1 efe is not just a cheaper s20 it's actually a better phone in a lot of important areas and is more of a competitor to the 1100 galaxy s20 plus first up we have the batteries coming at 4 500 millibars cell that is almost as big as the galaxy note 20 ultra whereas the standard galaxy s 20 only comes with a 4 000 millibar battery i can confidently say that the s20 fe is the first samsung phone with a 128 screen that can last you a full day the s20 fe is also rocking a flat display it's going to come down to personal preference whether you like edge screens or flat display i personally like flat displays because they're more comfortable to hold a flat screen means that the content won't cut out if you're using the third-party applications such as instagram or snapchat also we already use our galaxy s20 phones on full hd plus resolution anyways so i couldn't really tell major difference apart from the edge screen of the s20 series which yes does look a lot more premium but the full hd plus resolution on the s20 fe it does wonders to the battery and i think for most people it's a sweet spot also galaxy s20 fe while it is plastic it is still ip68 water and dust resistant it has a sport for wireless charging reverse wireless charging it uses plastic on the back which means it won't break like glass if you drop it while at the same time it won't get those fingerprint smudges on the back again considering the price difference unless you're getting a better deal i think most people will be fine with the galaxy s20 fe now before i talk about camera i want to give a big shout out to squarespace for sponsoring this video squarespace is an easy to use online

because it doesn't have that 64 megapixel telephoto lens instead it's rocking a less resolution 8 megapixel zoom lens that still offered 3x lossless zoom and up to 30x digital zoom as for the selfie camera samsung has brought a 32 megapixel selfie sensor it has a dedicated 32 megapixel mode which in a favorable lighting situation is going to put out a sharper selfie and it also allows you to shoot 4k 60 fps video software device is rocking the same one ui 2.5 as the s20 lineup it's also going to get three years of software update officially from samsung so the surprising truth of this video is that the galaxy s20 fe is not just a cheaper phone it gives qualcomm chip in most markets anyone with the exitus 990 is coming out 100 cheaper it's actually more of a competitor to the s20 plus rather than the galaxy s20 it's got a bigger battery coming at 4 500 million bars so with 120 hertz you get almost a day of usage this phone almost kills the galaxy s20 sales because of all its features at the cheaper price but that shouldn't be a surprise because s20 sales were already pretty bad all around the world and to top it off the whole pandemic situation also didn't help samsung at all there's a reason why samsung gave the 120s display to the s20 fe not the standard galaxy note 20. so all in all as the galaxy s20if is out and as i've used this phone personally i have to say it turned out to be a far better deal than just being a cheaper s20 variant as always let me know what you think about this in the comment section below and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out",

indulge myself with a bit of all a patient so I'm going to ask of hands but don't worry it's all about bricks it it's it's actually about a particular thesis of mine so my question to you is how many people in the audience play a musical instrument okay that's about 25 optimistically 25 percent and how many play a musical instrument in a band and do concerts on a regular basis to you and me I'll see you afterwards okay when I worked at Phil it's about a million years ago with Liam who's around somewhere still about 50% of the other group were musical of some kind so it's kind of interesting to see the difference today okay nothing to do with millimeter azor or whatever but interesting nonetheless so who is blue Wireless I'll start with that first so we've been around about 10 years were based in Bristol we actually started out as a as a digital modem company to develop gigabit rate modems for millimeter-wave applications so the core team we have about 30 silicon engineers in the team are focused on developing incredibly complicated baseband modem technology based on our own proprietary processor architecture but along the way we figured out the best way of selling it at the best price was actually build products I'm not just to build chips so we actually work with millimeter wave of RF partners to integrate with our modem and then develop cutting-edge products for for various applications like transportation which Helen mentioned at the outset sorts of few examples here so here's here's a 28 nanometer chip we heard about 20 nanometer before but this is a digital chip this is around 800 million transistors 17 individual processors six proprietary hybrid hardware software parallel engines of our own design and 23.5 gigas ample adda converters that's Giga sample adda converters so this thing can process to 2 gigahertz channels and generate a data stream of about 6 Giga bps from one piece of silicon which consumes about 2.5 watts so and it was right first time which was a big surprise to our customer who was there clearly not expecting that anyway as well as I'm building the chip we then put that into various products with millimeter-wave and we actually have two ongoing application projects the first one is fixed wireless access and this is in the city of Liverpool where we're part of a UK 5g testbed funded by the DCMS the UK government and we have a network of around 100 millimeter wave nose on lamp posts around the borough Kennington Kensington rather attached to the Lupul Hospital the the other project is a 5g testbed at Millbrook this is nominal but this is actually on the top gear test track at Dunsfold this is a McLaren sports car we work with McLaren on on various aspects of this so they wanted to know how fast millimeter-wave would go and they didn't believe us when we said it will go it will work rather at you know many hundreds of kilometres now so they they got this guy out of the garage and that I think we need to 80kmph was that down the down the runway before they got apply the brakes and no problem with our with our system and the in the final project is this one this is guess what it's a train case you didn't know this is actually one of the new cross rail trains on the kunas was lying when they finally open it this is on test at the Network Rail riddick test facility and melted mulberry and we've piggybacked on millimeter-wave on the track side there's a couple of our notes here on the roof of the train and we went up and down the line for three months or so characterizing the performance of millinery to aid in a training environment and this was a preamble to a commercial project that we started earlier this year with the first group company first group is the UK's largest train company they run the southwest line they were on the Great Western line and now they've just won the West Coast franchise as well from London to Glasgow so we're putting millimeter-wave on trains for Southwest line to start with and that will improve the the on train Wi-Fi cover which I'm sure everybody would agree if you tried it it's pretty rubbish at the moment so that's that's a leading application for us as we go forward so I mention these two projects auto air is the Millbrook testbed and the other one is Liverpool 5g they're two out of the six projects and coincidentally DCMS think these are the two best projects and of course I would say that wouldn't I remembers the Wi-Fi lines you k 5g IC which is the organization at the University of Surrey and we're also involved with a Facebook tip project and next week in Amsterdam there's the Facebook tip summit so we'll be there demonstrating our stuff and of course we need we'd to spend lots of other people's money to do all this stuff so we've got arm and calculus and many others in our investment investment pool most of our customers are either stateside or Japan and in fact first group is arguably the the first odden upon UK customer that we actually have alright so let's talk about spectrum and this is this is my Mickey Mouse guy to the millimeter wave spectrum we've heard about 28 gigahertz so far today where there's a lot of licensed activity some people might know that Verizon spent three billion dollars in the United States buying 50 percent of the u.s. spectrum at 28 gigahertz lotta money for fresh air and 39 gigahertz is another license frequency the US side I think in Europe extends down somewhat low land out into 26 and below the one that's interesting to us is unlicensed millimeter wave we like unlicensed and sort of our customers because it cost nothing and there's no better number than zero as far as the customer is concerned when he talks about a cost and recently the cpt changed the rules to be more in line with the u.s. FCC rules for operation between 57 to 71 gigahertz so that's 14 gigahertz of free bang weeds with 10 watts of the IRP you can do a hell of a lot with that from the point of view of a of a radio engineering product company and this is being adopted through so European law through directive 30 45 from the first of January 2020 and I have to thank Ofcom off the chair of that committee at CPT and and they were very instrumental in in helping push that forward and this allows well I've said here six by two gigahertz you've got 14 gigahertz deployers so you can move it anywhere you want to cross that band with that 40 DB MI and in fact the cpt rules light to go to 55 on the proviso you've got 30 DB I of game so you can go even higher than that if you have a high gain antenna okay here's my beamforming slide lots of people have been forming slides this morning so here's mine so on the transmit side you start with a with a single input you split it anyways you phase shift it to steer the beam you perhaps attenuate it to put some attenuation profile across the aperture then a vamp 'la fire per per chain as mentioned generating parent millimeter wave is challenging for mr. McKinnon to perspective typically around Tim only what's plus or minus a bit is is the KPI for that and then you put that into an array antenna and then you've got this coherent so wavefront and you steer that across the the face of the face of the array and you reverse the process in the receive side in this case you've got long as amplifies feeding receive chain you combine it then you then you down convert it to two baseband and then we do our meld m-magic to generate the gigabit data stream so on the power budget sign on th you get an N square gain and being the number of elements you get coherent addition form the P age and here an additional omni antenna elements on the receive side you only win once because noise goes up as well as power as it goes up by n power goes up by N squared you get an end gain on the receive side so 20 log on TX + 10 log on rx the other interesting point to to make is that for constant aperture gain goes up by a factor of s squared with frequency so of course 57 to 71 you get 1.9 DBS for free if you set your aperture for 57 so that's interesting from a link budget perspective so one of our partners is a Swedish company severs ima many of you have heard of them they've been around since the 1950s with various microwave components these days they're making a our FS or C's this particularly device they call EDA it's a ciggy by CMOS single chip memory to wave device which integrates 16 receivers 16 transmitters beamforming networks with around 5 bits of a face yes and amplitude control into an IQ up and down conversion this is a direct conversion architecture choose across fifty seven to seventy one gigahertz excellent phase noise we can do 64 gram or even better from the face not in seeking to deliver and when we combine that with this this simple phased array antenna where we've got 16 columns for TX and 16 for rx each is a four-element patch combined to a passive array we get about 23 DB i from that guy put it together we can exceed the the limit of 40 DB MI and get up to 40 3 DB MI and the scolson beams in action these are the six channels which are defined by the 11 ad spec that we generally use in most of the stuff we've been doing we can work around these channels but anyway these are the 6-2 gigahertz channels and you can see the 40 DB ml eyes here and then the beam is steered plus or minus 45 degrees a bit more than azimuth and there's around 64 beams across that aperture each beam is about 8 degrees in in being with so we get multiple beans per being with so we got a pretty good Clause all that so it's a very useful very powerful powerful radio and in the protocol what we do is we used a beam book to actually do a scan so we acquire the TX and rx beams dynamically as the TX is looking for the RX or vice versa so it's a beam book based approach if it's pretty common in most of the phased array solutions you hear about in the marketplace including 5g new radio from this we GPP okay so so what so the on the baseband side what's what's the big deal what's the problem well the problem is we've got a 3.5 gigahertz sample front end throwing this deluge of data at this modem it's going to turn that into useful packets and bits that can be connected to to an internet connection or whatever so unlike most wireless where the sample speed is much lower than the clock speed of the of the processor the opposite is true here so so we need a lot of parallelism to keep up with this 3.5 gigahertz front end in fact we need about ATX parallelism to cut with an S or C clock speed on my 28 nanometer chip of about 500 megahertz so we've designed a a parallel processor DSP engine that can do that and can do that with software-defined capability so we can fiddle around with Equalization we can fiddle around with modulation to your modulation and do a lot more tricks besides so there's a whole menu of items that we have to process in real time in the nanosecond time frame and then successfully capture decode demodulate and present those packets to the Mac layer then the Mac layer has to keep up with around a million or more packets per second encryption decryption point to multi-point control beamforming control and synchronization for example for a small cell a lot going on very quickly and all that requires around the terror of DSP you want to do that without burning a hole on the planet with a whole array of FPGAs as you see in most LTE base stations which seem to be more about boiling water than generating bits but nonetheless without without putting onto an SOC we'd have the same problem so here we've got effectively two terawatts you have two modems on one chip within within a 2.5 watt envelope so this is an our Hydra one technology which is 11 ad with extensions for infrastructure outdoor applications each physical layer can go up to 7.5 Giga bps with 64 cram we've got a bunch of stuff in there to cope with co-channel interference RF phase noise mitigation and a long list besides of all the different things we're working on the next gen which is 11a why that takes it up to 34 gigabit so that includes channel bonding time radiation and MIMO there is some ability to do meanwhat millimeter wave by using some reflections but that's that's coming soon so so we designed the architecture we spent a lot of time with our 30 or so silicon engineers we turn it into this lump of 28 nanometer we then put it into metal boxes we faced away in 10 GPS in case somebody Nix it to where it's gone so that's an important function so base by Miriam that so the other thing we do is we like to we like to license our technology to companies who are much bigger than we are so IDT which is now part of an SS took a license from our technology and we did a turnkey chip design for them so this device is actually available for purchase from IDT it's been in mass production since last year I can say two modems IQ in an ounce physical layer Mac layer we combine the two streams we put it through PCI Express and connect that to a network processor for the applications radio wise we started with psybeam soybean was a famous company very much a pioneering millimeter wave on CMOS and then we've moved to the civilly my device which I've already described and we don't see work with Nokia Bell Labs on their 90 gigahertz radio and for those Radiohead's in the audience if you want to look at that chip it's a fantastic piece of work there's a J SSC paper which was published in August of last year which describes that ship it's worth a read on its own so yeah okay on the rest have already said I think of course it's heavily software-defined so we've got a very sophisticated Linux framework and a driver that talks to the chip and sets it up with all these various modes then we put it in the metal box we call it metal box typhoon and we support all the features and we we have a an API which allows our customers to go in there and play and every time I present list the customers renters they usually come away with a purchase order so that it's a it's a very interesting box for for many reasons and one of the key KPIs is that this entire box only takes 40 Watts 40 watts for a box that can do three gigabits that's extremely powerful tat these at these face and by the way of that 40 Watts 30 watts is the Linux computer they rarely on the mo denry's less than 10 watts all right so the other thing is what is the data rate and isn't 60 gigahertz a waste of time because of oxygen absorption well okay it is if you if you look at the plot of DB per kilometer versus frequency you see this famous peak which is 60 gigahertz for option absorption somewhere around 15 even to 20 DB per kilometer but as soon as you get was 65 virtually nothing so you into into very low loss there so one of the first things we did was to go find the long stretch of beach and do some measurements earlier this year with the new civil radio integration and you can see on the left-hand side channel 2 which is down at 60 gigahertz you got the 15 DB per kilometer overhead we're getting about 300 meters at 2 Giga bps as we go out to channel number 6 which is right at the other end of the bands around 69 gigahertz you can see that that range is effectively doubled and since then we've improved the performance of the front end with various various methods and went out over a kilometer at the other top ends of the band so millimeter way B's not short range we can we can shoot Giga Hertz Giga bits over half a kilometer or more okay until the mill block thing which is what was exciting Helen at the outset so so this is the high speed test track at Millbrook this about 30 miles from here this is a two mile circumference four-lane highway which is a banked highway it was built by General Motors in the 1970s for testing Vauxhall motor cars and trucks but it's now privately held facility and this is a consortium of companies working on this all to wear 5g testbed DCMS funded project and our our piece of the project is to deliver this millimeter-wave testbed so we've got a network of 11 towers around the circumference of this of this bowl each tower has a red you're looking backwards and forwards then what we do is we put a a dual radio on top of the vehicle we call it a TN it's called a train nailed for reasons that come apparent later then we look up and down the track and as the as the car goes around the track it makes some brakes association with each of the towers to generate a continuous connection all the way around and then all the towers are fiber optic connectors together at layer 2 so a switch into into a gateway then off to the internet so so it's a very convenient way of tracking data and we can sit in Bristol and control this thing I'm on to the data in real-time as the car whizzes around the track phase 1 we started at 60 gigahertz with the aforementioned cyber radio and that was a bit limited in performance but we've doubled that now with the new 5771 gigahertz radio and it's really really looking extremely exciting in terms of performance at given these nice photographs this is the typhoon silver silver box that the radio is behind the under plate here there's a GPS I don't think is any favorite being peaceful anyway it's there and we've got you can see the four-lane highway the bank is such that you can do 130 miles an hour of the the top end of the of the bank and sometimes faster than that if you've got the right car one in the middle is the car mounted unit in fact this is a prototype for the for the Train mounted unit I'll show you later ready your friends come back again and that's a side view of course then of course you need some cars to make this or hang together so he's been photographed some some some customer meetings that we had at Millbrook to show people were careful bility so this is a mclaren 570s this is a Honda Civic R in fact this is the first on the Civic R built at Swindon so it's an extremely fast piece of equipment arguably almost as fast as the McLaren and then this is a high car Mercedes much more space inside of Mercedes so we can take customers around in comfort so there's EV the three three cars used and again you can see the the tier mounted on the roof inside the car is the is the Linux processor which happens to be armed based so then some results the other thing I mentioned was McLaren so if you watch Formula One you'll see all the squiggly lines that are on the curves as the cars go around the track that's generated by a tool they call Atlas we have Atlas embedded inside our system as well and what we do is we record all the key kpi's from the modem we export that to the server and then we can display that in real-time to see what's going on with the modem and the system so here we're showing the modulation coding scheme the higher the better so typically 0 to 12 12 is 16 km 0 is 27 megabits 16 km is around probably of its physical layer 3 Giga bits at the other data layer and we shall signal-to-noise this is amazing we're seeing synchronized in the region of 2018 DBS normally was scrabbling around in the 5 6 7 8 DB region and so it shows that these radios or where they are much more powerful than previous generation and then finally we have sweet pot we have friends on back radios and we also overlay with speed 13171 90k mph this staircase is association for each of the 11 towers so that's basically one lap around around Millbrook so so the so the net of all this is that we see at 1.6 Gbps average speed and a 3.1 gigabit peak and what's really interesting is the latency the latency is unbelievable not 0.72 not point nine milliseconds and that's through a gateway which is a McLaren product on the car and the on the track side and over there millimeter-wave the 5g guys the 5 g new radio guys I should say are talking about two milliseconds as the magic number and they're struggling to meet that we're already less than half that with with this solution we haven't even bothered optimizing it yet so this is extremely low latency system and as a comparison we also have a private 4G stock 5g network I should say at sir Millbrook which is also part of the same ole to air project typically they see 40 to 60 milliseconds latency and peaking around 300 when they have to do some difficult handover so this is extremely low latency system and that in itself is an interesting consideration for applications okay so picture of a train okay so Japanese train Japan is interesting country for this but I think it's also interesting in the UK and working here with first group as our as our partner we're going to market with first group and using they're using their contacts to generate business with various train companies around the world the first question is why bother well the reason - why bother is twofold number one what they do at the moment is they they take LTE off the roof of the train through 4 Sims they aggregate that and feed that through the Wi-Fi access points in the Train problem is that the LTE coverage along train tracks is not great and also the the moving village of passes change anyway it's a super chunk of demand which is really difficult to manage as as the train crosses through cell boundaries so it's a difficult sell your problem anyway and the second why bother is the cost the average cost of wholesale data is around $3 per gigabyte and if you do that some assuming at each train is consuming about a gigabit of traffic it's an enormous amount of money and therefore if a train company wants to support that kind of demand the economics show you that it's much more much more economic to deploy your own dedicated trackside network than it is to keep buying the data from the operators so that's another very important consideration and where is this demand coming from well if you if you go to Ofcom's website they did a report last year to the UK government on estimating the demand and they came up with demand curves which were at least a gigabit and going north of that as trains go into ever a higher capacity donc Siobhan did the same thing in Germany and they came up with pretty much the same numbers so the demand is there and the economics point to a different solution other than just using 4G or even 5g5 GNR at six you get about three gigahertz I should say will give you about 200 megabits and what dr. bond said was if you point to the inside capacity of the German five GNR network at the trains you only service 30% of their demand so clear that's not going to happen but that's not that's a limiting case okay so what we're doing is we're putting trackside towers roughly every kilometer if we have a straight line and we putting radios front and back of the Train each radio is a dual radio and that's on a 200 meter length can be anywhere in some longer trains there's an untrained backbone an Ethernet backbone which we use to aggregate the data and feed that's through Wi-Fi access points in the carriages and then the the trackside network has a dedicated 10 gigabit layer 2 network which then connects through a lathe we switch onto the external internet and here you see a couple of the couple of photographs this is the the TN unit which sits on the roof at the front and back most expensive component in the entire product is that chunk of aluminium which is there to short-circuit the overhead line when it falls on top of the Train welding short-circuit the passengers inside the Train that's a pretty important safety consideration for the for the system and the guy over here is the trackside unit these are mounted on the poles they have two radios looking up and down the track and the rest of electronics is the modem and the and the network processor to control the controller system so we're in the in the midst of developing these products they go on through radio type approval now we'll be deploying them in q1 of next year on Southwest Rail here some more Hardy snaps this these were from the Network Rail riddick trial from last from last year you can see the the TN unit here it's mounted on a riser to clear the HVAC unit which is the front of the train there it is again and then there's some shots of what's happening on track sign here's a couple of units mouth on the overhead lines tension there's 25,000 what cables here and there's a dedicated town that we that we designed and put up another point in the in the network one more point to add the system also can switch between existing Wi-Fi and 4G services using Yangcheng aggregation unit because the the train company isn't going to put this everywhere it's going to put it where the demand is at least to start with so the system has to switch backwards and forwards between the existing 4G based system and the millimeter wave system and this is a map of the Southwest rail network in the middle of doing some proving trials on the Isle of Wight at the moment and the deployment will be between just south of Clapham Junction all the way down to Basingstoke that's about 70 kilometers and we're going to put that around 200 trains that go up and down that line as the first step and that that meets the that meets the criteria set by Southwest well in their franchise agreement with the UK government okay so so that's that's the end so some takeaways so phased array radios at 5771 gigahertz are here today they're commercial elements you can buy them from because from partners such as citizenry in our case your work extremely well they deliver carrier grade performing by combining that with some of the features on modem we can really deliver some very interesting infrastructure style applications we can meet and exceed the 5g KPIs are set by the ITU at the beginning of the FRG story more than a gigabit unless in millisecond latency for the world and rail applications we're talking to Road application companies as well particularly in Japan who really are interested using this this band for for Vito X applications the 5g testbed at Millbrook was already validated many of the kept yards I'll be talking about in this presentation and we're deploying this commercially starting in the UK from for the begin of next year ok thank you very much and there's a picture of a

there's people in my house well not anymore don't be you could have died you're welcome", "1BuTwOhEkOM": "what's going on guys my name is wade with tech daily and in this video we are checking out the new samsung galaxy s20 fe 5g yes that is quite the name but this is quite the device it is essentially a slightly less premium version of the flagship s20 with still a ton of great features and specs it comes in a whole bunch of fun new colors and most importantly it is significantly cheaper i personally think this s20 fe or fan edition is the best smartphone samsung has launched so far this year i think it's gonna appeal to a lot of people and i'm really excited to check it out so i won't waste any more time let's just go ahead and unbox this thing and see what the s20 fe has to offer now as i go through the box here the first thing i want to mention is the price while the flagship s20 sells for 9.99 the s20 fe comes in at 6.99 but actually samsung and best buy and amazon are all running sort of an introductory deal where you can get this phone for 5.99 that's what i bought mine for and i'll leave some links down below in the video description so you can maybe snag that deal too if it's still available for you pulling off the lid of the box the first thing we get of course is the s20fe itself you can see i got mine in this really nice mint green color and this phone is also available in navy blue lavender red white and orange so like i said tons of color options to choose from digging a little deeper inside the package unfortunately we don't get too much else actually just the included wall plug and usb-c cable but interestingly enough this phone ships with the smallest usb wall adapter even though it does support up to 25 watt fast charging so keep that in mind you can utilize this phone with a much more powerful samsung brick if you have one but aside from the charger and some additional paperwork that's all you get with this phone with all that stuff out of the way once again here is the s20 fe and right off the bat i have to say i think this is a really good looking device it obviously looks pretty similar to the flagship s20 but let's go ahead and talk about some of the things that make this phone a little different for starters this is a 6.5 inch device so it's a little larger actually than the regular s20 at least by height mostly but that means you're getting a whole lot of screen to work with it feels relatively comfortable in the hand and obviously with a great screen to body ratio and really minimal bezels all around there's not a whole lot of extra bulk in the way it's a very modern very premium looking device and if you're curious size wise here is how this phone stacks up against the a51 and the a71 it actually falls sort of in the middle it's a bit slimmer width wise than both other phones but all in all the fe is similarly sized to the two larger a series devices you might also notice that this s20 fe has a flat panel display no curved glass edge or sloping front screen here and i know some people might actually consider that a positive so i just thought i'd point that out around back the fe has a plastic rear cover samsung calls it glastic like they always do it's a matte finish that's made to sort of mimic frosted glass even though it's not and it is essentially the same sort of material and finish that we got on the flagship note 20. the frame is all metal with a polished finish and a contrasting color so the phone still has some weight to it and it certainly feels sturdy all around it looks nice too honestly samsung is just all over the place with materials right now so i can't really complain one way or another especially since this phone doesn't actually have any compromises on features it offers wireless charging reverse wireless charging via powershare and its ip68 water and dust resistant so plastic back aside you don't miss out on anything else taking a look around at the rest of the device the left side has nothing going on but the right side has of course the usual power button and volume buttons up top there's the sim and sd card tray so we do get expandable storage here and down below there's the usbc charging port obviously and the speaker and this phone does have dual stereo speakers with the additional one and the earpiece around back the s20 fe has a triple camera setup which i'll talk about in a bit and if you're curious that camera bump is much more subtle than some other devices we've seen which is nice underneath the front display there's the fingerprint reader which just in my initial tests here seems very fast it's definitely on par with the flagship s20 and significantly faster than what we get on the a series phones and of course there's also face unlock 2 which feels quite fast as well okay so let's talk specs since i think this is really what people want to know about first off the six and a half inch screen is a 2400 by 1080 super amoled panel packing in 407 pixels per inch on one hand it's covered in gorilla glass 3 so it's not really as durable as the newer flagship phones with that new updated gorilla glass but the big thing you do get here is the super smooth high refresh rate 120hz option and on a phone like this i think that's really awesome personally i would much rather have a 120hz refresh rate over qhd resolution and that's exactly what we get here and if you haven't yet tried a phone with a high refresh rate display i think it really is quite the experience the phone just feels so fast it's so smooth and snappy and i think with this device here along with like the oneplus nord for example and a couple others in its price range this is really gonna set the stage for a vast majority of other new devices next year to all offer this super high refresh rate option couple that with a beautiful amoled panel that supports up to hdr 10 plus and you've got yourself a fantastic viewing experience from top to bottom inside the s20 fe also packs basically flagship internals you get the snapdragon 865 chipset paired with the adreno 650 gpu either 6 or 8 gigabytes of ram and ufs 3.1 storage yes you can still get more ram in the actual flagship s20 if you want but besides that minor little comparison there's really nothing else to complain about you're getting nearly the same specs that some people paid a thousand dollars or more for just six or seven months ago but now for considerably less money and looking ahead these kinds of specs in my opinion make this phone a good long-term investment i was honestly kind of surprised samsung went all in with the internals here that was absolutely the right move and it positions this phone as likely the best all-around value samsung device on the market right now the phone in my opinion really has no compromises and i think even power users and heavy gamers will appreciate what all this phone does have to offer and by the way the s20 fe even has a slightly larger battery than the flagship s20 this phone gets a 4500 milliamp capacity while the flagship s20 had a 4 000 milliamp capacity that's not really a huge difference i realized that and the increase in screen size for example might even things out a little bit but still bigger is usually better so it's kind of nice to see the cheap little included wall plug like i mentioned earlier is a bit insulting but i can look past that since everything else that's going on with this phone is so great finally let's talk about those cameras and with this there's really two important things to mention first off the selfie camera up front is better than the flagship s20s this phone has a 32 megapixel shooter up front while the flagship s20 had just a 10 megapixel selfie lens around back though while the main lens and ultra wide lens are seemingly the same 12 megapixel setups from the flagship phone the thing that gets downgraded is the telephoto lens the fe has just an 8 megapixel zoom lens and while yes you still get the fun 30 times zoom it isn't quite as good as the flagship phones honestly though i don't really mind that because you get everything else and i don't really use the heavy zoom anyway the full suite of shooting modes is here including 4k 60fps video with the front and rear cameras and in my brief time using this device image quality looks really stellar i'm looking forward to putting it to the test against the flagship s20 just to sort of see the results but i'd suspect it should be as good if not completely identical in the end which again is awesome considering you get a nearly flagship camera setup for considerably less money all in all if you couldn't tell already i'm a big fan of this s20 fan edition i think this phone is going to be super popular especially here in the us as it should be it's priced right but in cutting the cost samsung didn't really compromise on much if anything i'm looking forward to putting this phone through its paces in the coming days but my initial thoughts are simply that i think this is absolutely going to be the samsung phone to buy now for a vast majority of people it's likely going to be a really fantastic investment but what do you guys think about this new s20 fan edition let me know in the comments down below i'd love to hear your thoughts of course hopefully you guys did

surprised Samson is on to something that we never thought they will do right now they have a lot on their plate they are working on the fall befo as well as the Samsung Galaxy S 10 series which includes four models this year the S 10 s 10 + S 10 e and also the 5 D Galaxy S 10 all with tons of Mitterrand devices that they have planned for this year you might think yes that's a lot of stuff happening but if you think this is all what Samsung will do then you are wrong Samsung is about to surprise us all by launching a phone that is more futuristic than the Galaxy S 10 family yes a phone that is completely bezel s with no more no not just a beautiful Super AMOLED display this has been done before by a couple of Chinese phones but not from sensing and seems like they are about to do it and no it's not going to happen the note 10 or any on the Galaxy S series it will happen with the phone called Galaxy a 90 I soon you were straight out saying a 90 perfect and then he explained his compliments saying that this will be Samsung's first pop up front camera phone no noise no hole that would result in a fully bezel s screen very similar to the one that we saw in that concept video where this guy is holding this completely baseless phone sam saying is making that happen so if you think about it the a 90 will be more futuristic looking than the galaxy s 10 series and you might be thinking to yourself why Samsung is not doing this on their flagship phones and the answer to that question is very simple it is not practical having a mechanical camera or a moving bar on the phone definitely make it less durable and obviously to manufacture such a phone with a moving camera system on a large scale is difficult so that's why Samsung cannot do it and can't risk the durability of their flagship phone by having a moving camera system on their phone this is pretty much them flexing their muscles saying hey if we want to make a business phone we can do it but it's not gonna happen with the flagship phones that's why the galaxy a 90 is said to be the first Samsung phone to have this pop up camera system and if you know about the a series they are market oriented phones they get mostly lost in Asia and most of them don't even come to US market and other areas so galaxy a 90 will definitely going to be specific to China market and from that it can come to other markets such as India so total numbers are way less compared to their Galaxy Note and s Lana that's why they are doing this without any problem on a mid-range level phone now obviously we don't know what other specification on this phone will be there's a good chance that this phone might be powered by the Exynos 961 zero processor that recently got leaked with this SM a 50 phone this actually Galaxy a 50 so we could see a 60 a 70 and a 80 phones as well in between and the a 90 will be the most futuristic bezel-less phone utilizing the pop up front camera I would love to see how Samsung will implement this tank in their phone let me know your thoughts on the pop up camera system in the comment section below also we have a huge news regarding the connectivity power of the Galaxy S 10 family I'm happy to see that the s10 family has support for Wi-Fi 6 if you guys don't know about Wi-Fi says this is something that the next iPhones will have it's the next generation of Wi-Fi connectivity that allows for higher data rates increase capacity a huge difference in the range and also it improves power efficiency so I'm really really glad to hear that the Wi-Fi performance will be top-notch on the whole Galaxy S 10 lineup and along with that we're gonna see wireless charging yes there is a document that's called wireless power transfer which reveals that the galaxy assistant family will get the support for reverse wireless charging meaning you will be able to use any of the galaxy stand model as a wireless charger I've heard this rumor a couple of months ago but now this pretty much confirms that this is indeed happening on all the galaxy s 10 models also we have some phantom 2 cases for the galaxy s 10 series and this basically confirms the screen sizes that we already know for all the S 10 models so five point eight inch for s 10 light or s 10 e 6.1 inch for Galaxy S 10 and six point four inch for the S 10 plus and from the cutout you can see that single camera is dead the Galaxy S 9 was the last Samsung S flash to have a single-camera foe the latter version starts with dual cameras and then triple cameras with the S 10 and s 10 plus and 4 with the S 10 5g so yeah that's all we have on the latest Samsung news Galaxy a 90 a more futuristic phone than the S series and no series is coming really soon with a pop-up camera I'm really interested to see how Samsung will implement their version of it how'd ruble it will be and how much practical it will be this year Samsung is going all-in I am so excited let me know your thoughts in the comment section below and I will catch you guys in the next one peace out", "3MRgO8dcu0w": "it's a city hey i see you okay what is she [Music] i see our enemies [Music] did you guys exist oh i see his name

mid-range flagship device when unboxed you get a charging adapter cable case and the manual [Music] oneplus note built with snapdragon 765 chipset with adreno 620 gpu and featured a 6.4 inch floyd amoled screen with gorilla glass 5 protection but sadly nothing about the waterproofing level [Music] let's do a basic waterproofing test of the phone the test includes water dropping pouring showering and submerging followed by a splash effect with the water [Music] starting with the shower test once the water starts pouring it creates its own screen responses but it is nothing to get panic the functionalities are still intact [Music] let's do further testing on the phone [Music] for the verification let's dip the phone into a small tank and leave it for five minutes in some reports it says oneplus has tested this device for 30 seconds in third centimeter of water either way let's check it out how it will react with more time in the [Music] water [Music] once you take out the phone after five minutes the phone still functions and intact with original standards which ensures the primary waterproofing grade is acceptable let's do some testing on primary functionalities on the phone [Music] as you can witness the touch feel and sense haven't got changed [Music] the camera is capturing super clear [Music] snapshots so [Applause] the sound quality also looks fine [Music] hey hello hello can you hear me yes okay okay bye-bye the call quality looks great too [Music] the charging cable detect and charging perfectly after the water test it seems that all functionalities looks perfect still there is no official confirmation from oneplus regarding the waterproofing level so our advice is to keep the phone away from the water let us know what you think

rest of the lineup in the Oppo find x2 series so we have the OP I find x2 neo and the Oppo find x2 light I've been using Oppo find XT Pro so I'm excited to check out these two new devices to see what they have to offer but without forever chat let's see what's inside a box so if you're thinking of getting one you know exactly what you'll be getting and all the specifications rundown as well let's check it out so both devices are 5g devices thanks to that snapdragon 765 G mobile platform and inside the box you get identical items in there so you get your silicon case to keep your devices are protected and secure you've gots the device itself inside of packaging and then you've also got your USB C charging cable a pair of headphones a sim ejector tool that also looks like the Oppo logo that Oh in the Oppo logo and you've also got your power supply units in there as well and as this has coming to the UK I've got the three pin charging power block supply units inside of boxes first up on the Oppo find X 2 neo we have this 7.7 millimetres body thickness of a device it looks very slim it looks really nice that feels nice to hold in hand you have a 6.5 inch OLED dual curved flexible perforated screen that's got a refresh rate of up to 90 Hertz and 180 Hertz touch of sampling rate as well you've got the screen ratio of 20 by 9 and a PPI of 402 so it's nice and sharp and bright looks really good the display is HDR 10 plus certified and you've got a 2400 by 1080 screen resolution in daily use the brightness of the display of the aqua file next to neo can reach about 500 nits of brightness and a maximum brightness of full screen at about an increased rate of up to 800 nits as well you have Joe stereo speakers of Dolby Atmos which is really good it sounds really loud and to keep things cool when you game in or watching videos you have a multi layer liquid cooling system in there as well in terms of processor as mentioned before you have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 gene mobile platform in there so it's 5g ready to go get 12 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gig of internal storage battery you get 4025 million power and you've also got a Buch flash charging 4.0 in there while so this charge in here has been increased from 20 watts of the Luke 3.0 to 30 watts so with this you can charge a device from 3 percent to 50 percent in just 20 minutes and after 56 minutes to get it back to full power on the front as well you get that 32 megapixel front-facing camera for you selfie lovers out there and if you turn it around you can see the quad camera set up so you got 48 megapixel main camera and it's a Sony AMX 586 sensor with F 1.7 large aperture and optical image stabilization next you have an 8 megapixel 116\u00b0 wide-angle camera with anti distortion so with this one you can also use for macro shots as well with that 2.5 centimeters focus in distance which is really good you don't have a 13 megapixel telephoto lens our F 2.4 aperture and it offers five times hybrid optical zoom and you also get two megapixels of black and white camera so you might want to get creative with that one if you want some different kind of shots to post on Instagram or whatever the offer I find x2 near comes in two colors so you get this one here which is this very blue which looks really nice especially when your shimmer against lights it can have that two-tone color going on here looks really good there's also new lights black version available as well the aqua fine x2 neo is running color OS 7 which is based on Android 10 so you get dark mode you can do a post share and so many other things it looks really nice it's neat it's clean and it's one of the best ones out there in my opinion one thing I like about both devices is the fact that you also get to that under screen fingerprint sensor resort I'm facial recognition so you can quickly log into your device whenever you need to do so onto the top I find X 2 light we have a six point four inch AMOLED water-drop screen display here and we've also got a 20 by 9 aspect ratio and it looks very slim and slick as well which I really like one thing you notice on this one is you do get a 3.5 mm headphone jack right on the bottom of the the device which is we just always welcomed it's running cholera s7 with Android 10 and you got Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 G so this is 5 G as well this also supports a vu flash charge 4.0 technology again for that quick charge you've got four thousand and twenty five million power battery in there as well again big battery to go and the screen resolution is 1080 by two 400 for the camera on the back you get 48 megapixel main camera which it also uses that I am x58 6 are Sony sensor with F 1.7 large aperture you get E is optical image stabilization it supports 30 frames per second so you can do 4k at 30 on both devices you can also achieve 720p slo-mo if you want to do that kind of stuff at up to 240 frames per second for the landscape photographers out there you get an 8 megapixel wide-angle camera at F 2.25 aperture and it's also got 119 degrees anti distortion wide-angle for you so you be able to get this landscape shots as you wish to do so you've also got 2 megapixel black and white camera and a 2 megapixel film style camera so you get this film look without having to do too much on the front there's a 13 megapixel front-facing camera at F 2.0 and this is capable of shooting 1080p HD videos as well as that qualcomm snapdragon 765 g you got a gig of ram and under and 28 gig of internal storage for color availability this will come in me like black which is this one here and also a pearl white version the awkward find next to neo is going to retail for around five hundred and ninety nine pounds here in the UK and it's gonna be available in stereo blue at o2 and Carphone Warehouse and the moon light black is gonna be available at E Carphone Warehouse as well Oh to Virgin Media and Amazon if you buy the OP I find X 2 neo you get a free pair of Bang & Olufsen vo play a one the second generation which retails for around 200 pounds and this offer will end on the 10th of June so take advantage of that if you're thinking of getting one the Aqua fine x2 lights will retail for around 399 pounds so nice cheap and cheerful move without compromising on features specifications and quality it's gonna be available in pearl white at Kauffman

one hundred percent pure dark chocolate thin and it's from a max brainer if you can see this okay so this is from new york and i believe it's made from um just normal normal chocolate in which is a frey thrill Carol it's at least pictum expensive chocolate beings otherwise you will list it was specialized if it's other create creek real are real that's how to say it anyway alright so let's try this out okay so you see like this looks like a so that when you first see this this look like a cigarettes that's what I think and then all right now I'm gonna open this and all right so you can see right now i'll equip this I'll go open this all rights a very easy to open so when I will finish you see it has um s6 of it and now I see like why they call this dark chocolate then cuz it's just really a thing slice of chick okay and I'm gonna try it it says it's hundred percent pure so I know like I guess it up to like you must be tried on seventy percent eighty percent ninety percent but I know tried a hundred percent based on the description it doesn't have milk yeah so it may contain soy peanuts Milk tree nuts so how does this make it one hundred percent pure all right I'm gonna try my first bite hmm so we bite it inside your tits pretty sweet surprise Lee mm-hmm it has this musty dark chocolate taste um it's very flavorful all set and even though it says it doesn't contain milk but I can taste this very creamy texture from the chocolate and yeah it's not better compared to seventy percent or seventy eight percent it's actually i'll say the taste flavorful I mean the taste is actually similar to godiva and if you try to Trader Joe's and um what's our nother one called um yeah if you tried a trader juice Switzerland import chocalate seventy two percent it's actually tastes like that it doesn't it's not better than anything like um oh which was my chocolate anyway it's not actually better than eighty percent so let me get another bite that's pretty normal all right it does have this after like you chew for a little bit it has its back taste of them really sweet it doesn't have the fruit it does have like little bit fruits um fruits smell come out but it's not sour at all I'll say so I believe it didn't contain that much fruity it doesn't contain that much fruity beans when you're making this so yeah I think it's pretty good and I don't know how much is it um but yeah I recommend this to you if you would like to try this but it's not better for people who get used to dr. a dark chocolate so it's not bitter it's sweet its creamy and it doesn't contains milk it's not necessarily kosher or vegan based on their descriptions but it's worth to try um and it's not bitter all right I'll see you next time how was it", "9y7S4G1ZBk0": "you're watching the intel network and edge v summit series with our focus today on 5g the 5g core is vital to deliver the promise of 5g services but to do so the ecosystem needs to closely collaborate to collectively address the challenges of deploying a cloud-native based 5g core network and provide communications service providers with the ability to offer new services joining me now to discuss the importance of the 5g core and deployment strategies are alex quiche vice president network platforms group and general manager y-line and core network division at intel miguel carreras who is director of network and technology planning at verizon and akil gokul who is chief technology officer core and it at ericsson hello everybody and thanks for joining us on our 5g core panel hello thank you alex if i could start with you um what is the industry outlook for the 5g core today and also where are we with technology readiness overall the industry outlook for 5g is actually tracking well along with the 5g deployments that are happening around the world and have been happening for the past couple of years and will continue out through the years to come one of the characteristics of the 5g network is that it's uh virtualized and it's moving to a cloud-native environment and the virtualization of networks actually started not with 5g but you know over like a decade ago with the advent of nfv where the industry started transitioning from very vertically oriented vertically integrated hardware and software solutions for the network and the um decoupling of hardware and software uh started with uh with nfv and it's been happening you know again for you know over the past eight to ten years or so and with the decoupling of hardware and software the solutions that are based on high performance hardware compute communication server technology that powered the network today actually have reached the point where they can scale well with the requirements of the 5g core network and then the software infrastructure from osb's and software solutions coming from leading companies like ericsson have also been modified to take advantage of these off the shelf communication server-based technologies where i think today you have a very uh compelling um and adequate set of solutions to power the 5g core networks um so that's my view i'd love to hear from my colleagues that uh at erickson and at uh verizon so akeel and miguel i'd love to hear your thoughts on on where you see the the 5g outlook and then the technology readiness no thanks alex and you know as you mentioned i think the ecosystem is primed for 5g to scale some of the technology advancements that happen in the 4g world with virtualization we have piki backing on it so 5g is here now we see a lot of traction for the non-standalone deployments and when it comes to ericsson we are there in 45 live networks across 25 countries uh involved with 5g deployments um 5g core is an instrumental part of that it's a cornerstone where you translate connectivity to a user experience you translate connectivity into uh agility and programmability of the network that can be that can be exposed to the end user yeah and so from my perspective i i have to agree with uh alex and i kill both i think we've set the foundation for how we want these networks to work in the future and what we want them to look like for the next 10 years we are well along the way on the 5g side with a lot of deployments around the world including here in the us different services different spectrum assets being put to work on the 5g course specifically i think we're still in the infancy right we we have the first trial systems uh we are kind of grasping how things are going to work in this new cloud-native micro service kubernetes-based architecture and networks and how we're going to be scaling them how we're going to be feeding architectures to use cases and deliver the kind of the promise of 5g thanks everyone miguel if i can continue with you what is the expected timing for the commercial rollout of the 5g standalone core and also what are the main use cases that customers consumers and businesses are demanding which the 5g core will have to process so it's a really good question so we are starting to see some of the first early deployments trial announcements happening around the world with the early adopters um so this is kind of an opportunity for all of us to learn and see how these networks operate how they how they scale how the services can work how the frontline teams can manage and optimize these networks um at the same time the standalone is not just a core player you need the entire ecosystem to be developed so you need the support on the run side on the device and on the chipset so i think we are still early um as i said the early trials and deployments are happening as we speak as far as volumes and massive adoption i think we are uh yeah starting is probably something that's gonna happen over the next two to three years great and akil what are the different paths that your customers can take in order to deliver 5g core when it comes to 5g core there are different aspects you know with 4g you have the virtualization of evp then the early introduction of 5d with option 3x i gave some enhanced capability to the 4g network and when you can't look at 5g core it brings the additional value in terms of cloud native deployment and a new architecture with service based architecture so essentially ericsson approach has been to give flexibility to our service providers to accommodate different starting point the way we have looked at providing this flexibility is with the dual mode 5g core portfolio our dual mode 5g core portfolio essentially incorporates uh 4g epc functionality 5g nsa functionality as well as the 5g core essay functionality and we bring in all of these functional capabilities on a common cloud native platform by doing this we give them flexibility to start in any one of the three tracks we have some operators who i would say have explored the 4g track with technologies like cups as well as bringing in some of the container network functions in the 4g network however the majority of the deployments that we see globally have started with the option 3x this is an area where you know ericsson along with other industry partners and operators um have gravitated towards a 132 approach and that's been very helpful option three towards an option two uh where the ecosystem is focusing in that direction and miguel akiel just spoke there about the different tracks are available what path has verizon chosen to deploy its 5g core and what are the advantages to using this approach so i can actually set up the kind of the my answer really well already right so um we advise we are very happy to see that the ecosystem has kind of settled on this one option three and then evolution to option two approach uh over the last couple of years there was a lot of noise based on the multiple evolution options that 3bp offer moving from epc to 5dc um and so we were concerned and some other like-minded minors were concerned as well that some of those options would end up kind of splitting the resources that had to work in the specifications to solidify something that could actually be implemented so you know definitely very happy to see that this one to three to two is becoming the norm our approach is very aligned to what akil was describing we are building a 5d core with a 10 year out output right so we are building the network that we are going to be using to serve our customers to bring new services for the next 10 years at the same time we have very practical needs as well we we have uh you know 120 some million subscribers generate a lot of usage and we want to move all the traffic to the new core to the directional platform as soon as possible and this concept of a combo architecture where the 5d core can serve the pre-existing option 3x traffic as well as potentially 4g traffic is obviously very compelling to us and we see this as the key enabler for some of the main goals that we're trying to accomplish with the 5d core against offload the traffic we already have be able to offer differentiated services that are consistent no matter what the access technology and then some of the the other more advanced services that will be coming up where we have use cases that will require workloads to be placed in different parts of the network and the 5g core and and the 3pp specs that come with the 5d core provided the flexibility and the elegance right to accomplish some of these new architectures that fit better the use case then you could do it with previous iterations of the core alex this all obviously requires industry collaboration how is the ecosystem working together to bring solutions to market for the 5g core yeah that's uh that's a good question uh it takes a village uh to bring together solutions for the 5g core i think uh you know if you go back to the um the statement i made earlier about the decomposition of hardware and software moving into a virtualized environment moving into cloud native that really unleashes a tremendous amount of innovation of potential across the industry and for leading companies like uh you know verizon to offer really compelling 5g services but that decompos decomposition of hardware and software actually poses different challenges in that where the industry is moving from single vendor solutions to now multi-vendor environments where you have to bring solutions from vendor a working on top of vendor b working on top of vendor c and that sometimes can actually delay the trials and deployments so a big area of focus for the industry and certainly for intel and our partners is to really look at how to deliver pre-integrated pre-configured pre-tested pre-validated solutions so that we can accelerate the trials and accelerate deployments one of the things that intel provides is what we call intel like solutions which are pre-configured solutions that we actually work with a number of different vendors in the ecosystem to drive scale so we test and and we validate these solutions and we know that whoever is going to consume these solutions uh can have the peace of mind that the solutions uh work well um another way we work with the ecosystem um you know let's say with uh with with erickson is to partner with erickson to optimize uh what akil mentioned their uh dual uh core uh aesthetic solutions uh to have that uh instead of suite of applications uh take full advantage of the underlying performance hardware uh so that when we bring these solutions into a service provider network that the solutions we know will work and that actually can actually shorten the time to deployment akil are there any special or new technologies that are you you are designing into your 5g core network products that are making this transition and making the deployments easier and more operationally efficient for operators absolutely if you look at 5g core it is part of the network when it comes to the transformation uh you're taking something that's fundamental and giving an end user experience so from that point of view we see our customers kind of taking a two-fold approach one is to bring in the benefits of cloud native platform web scale platform through their network and the other one is to introduce a new paradigm uh shift in their architecture from a network design perspective with sba and we feel to enable both of those tracks uh we need to provide a set of portfolios uh that enables that smooth migration uh so here erickson we have taken a twofold strategy uh one is to ensure that there is a smooth horizontal integration so erickson brings capabilities not only with the core technologies with 5g but also on the radio side and the i.t side of the house so we enable an end-to-end functional validation which helps accelerate the adoption of ig core technologies the other area that we focus is to be agnostic and dovetail very well into existing investment made when it comes to northbound integration with regards to orchestration and management systems the approach is to build upon existing investments in etsy in aligned with new disruptions coming with own app and things of that nature on the southbound side when deploying on cloud native platforms we have taken a cloud native first approach we work very closely with the cncf community and by doing that our applications are agnostic and can sit on top of any cloud platform uh we've also focused on some other areas of innovation to help this transition which are more focused on the operational aspects by not losing sight of the needs on the 4g network which gets translated to 5g but at the same time bringing the innovation and new capabilities that cloud native behavior brings to the table so it's an amalgamation of both that we're trying to find a nice balance and provide it to our service providers in addition we have focused on couple of areas of innovation particularly to make the network more programmable and expose network assets to our end customers so there is an emphasis on the exposure capability and then one of the benefits of 5g core is you get much more granular ways of defining your policies and your quality of experience and we want to enable that to be translated to the end customer the other area and i think alex mentioned about this briefly is talking about how we can look at performance we're talking about low latency high bandwidth very fast throughput high throughput fast fees and there is there's a focused attention that we are working with partners like intel verizon and others in the ecosystem to drive high performance applications for your forage or your edge computing scenarios thank you akil miguel can i ask why is the 5g core built on it on a service based architecture so that's probably one of my favorite questions guy and i think akil again said the the foundation pretty good here um so if you think about what we are trying to get with the 5d core from architecture perspective we'll eventually have a core that's a lot more complex than what we've had in the past with previous generations right so different slices different network functions which might be shared by multiple slices or fully dedicated to an individual slice depending on the use case and they will have another functions that are decomposed into microservices so this these networks are more complex you have more instances to manage and those instances have to communicate if you think about how things are done in the 4d core today and in other legacy technologies most of the relationships between the applications is very point to point you tell application a that for a given code flow or use case it needs to talk to application b and there is one or a limited set of ways to reach that application well so if you try to apply that same principle to that architecture of the future that we'll have in the 5v core it could be impossible to manage i we we need basically a network where service discovery is built into the very foundation of the software from day one that enables their automation orchestration and they provide the flexibility that accomplishes two things like this very complex network has to be simple to be operated therefore uh you have service orchestration you have self healing at the same time you have the flexibility that customers are looking for at the end of the day we are building a core yes for us engineers will have nothing like a very expensive tool and we have to deliver value to our customers and what do our customers want is the services that the ecosystem will dream of the ones that we don't even know are coming yet they'll have some very specific requirements and the expectations will be that the 5d core and the 5g ecosystem overall will help us meet those requirements to support those services immediately super fast right so that's one of the goals that we we need service-based architecture for and then if we think about the enterprise side of things the enterprises want to be able to differentiate different traffic types they want to prioritize for example sensors over tablets they want to accomplish their latency goals for mission critical applications while some of the other traffic is still best effort and so we will have to get a network that's very dynamic and programmable to me in those different requirements and sba is a big component of that and moving forward what is the role of the central office yeah that's a really good question guy and so when you think about the the conversation with just adam service based architecture the role of the different locations within the network is going to evolve and the next generation central office is a good example like we will have a future in which the border between mobility services fixed services kind of blurries will will have um what used to be only the river over fiber will be delivered over wireless now and we'll want to make sure we have a consistency and that comes a different set of requirements right you might have um different amounts of throughput the different types of what's the regular busy hour or the typical user behavior and we'll have to be able to customize the set of features and even the architecture of the applications that serve this new generation central office the needs of a fixed wireless service or a traditional fiber service are very different from mobility service so service based architecture will help us identify what services the customer wants what technology we need to make sure we meet the requirements of that service and where those workloads should be placed within the network alex building on what mcgill has just talked about what has intel done from a platform perspective to support and address this service based architecture sure yeah intel has done a lot of things just from a platform perspective to address the service based architecture and actually to provide you know uh the best uh optimized resources you know for and in service of this this architecture you know starting with uh with our um xeon processors of course cpus uh that that power much of the the infrastructure we've made general generation and generation enhancements uh to uh the cpus to optimize on communications workloads and then from a platform perspective we see what we can do working with not just cpus but with a network interface cards to implement features such as ddp or dynamic device personalization to optimize traffic flows towards the cpu cores to get even more performance for specific comms workloads like packet processing for uh and in service of this uh these architectures and then we've also done a lot of plug-ins uh into uh the cloud-native foundation into cncf to expose more of these platform-level features so that the network applications the the cloud-native applications a lot of complexity of what miguel was talking about can actually be exposed to the applications and the applications can take full advantage of them uh without necessarily having to know exactly what's in the hardware itself right so working with vendors in the uh abstraction layers to expose a lot of the goodness that the the hardware infrastructure provides uh to power up this the services based uh architecture that is the 5g core a question for all of you now and let's start with akil if i can ask you first what do you think are some of the future challenges moving forward with 5g core network and its deployment right so if i look at future challenges um what i see in the short term period between you know the 2021 time frame there's going to be a lot of emphasis to industrialize the network right we are bringing in new technologies from a platform point of view uh in addition we're also bringing the new architecture so there'll be an emphasis on industrializing giving the operational ease and having a sense of familiarity to build upon if you look beyond that the emphasis is really on the programmable nature of the network and exposing capabilities um so there you know we're looking for innovation um you know we're looking for more value-added services that can move beyond the core network and build up on what we can do with slicing technologies uh service agility to bring up new dedicated networks um and things of that nature so i see the challenges kind of twofold in the very beginning it's all about industrialization getting the adoption uh having a smoother transition between the forging networking network um and in parallel there is going to be a sense of uh you know leveraging the capabilities uh you know towards the enterprise customers or or building upon uh you know as media mentioned earlier use cases for the consumer segment with the gaming and things of that nature so uh we see a combination of both and what is going to be pivotal is making sure that journey is as smooth as possible indeed and miguel what future challenges do you foresee speaking on kind of a kill sensor so i i when i look at my current function i see two main challenges even within verizon right so i i serve two communities of internal customers i have to be very mindful of what services i enable my marketing and product team to build right so we can provide value to the customers and we can generate the revenue but obviously it's how we deliver value back to our stakeholders so that's critical at the same time i have an equally important set of customers downstream that are going to be running this network so one of the challenges that i see is we are rolling on a lot of technology a lot of this technology is new uh for us and us and uh you know with flexibility that the technology provides comes complexity as well so i think it's gonna be critical for all of us really represented in this call and alex also touched on this is to build a very robust tool set that helps the teams that effectively run these very complex large networks operate them to the level of performance that we've grown accustomed to and beyond in a way that is simple right this uh you know it should be easy for the the downstream teams to be able to tell what is and isn't working and be able to take actions to remediate issues as they happen so we are those two are top of mind and then the third one when looking at the ecosystem outside is i think the promise of five is so significant um there are so many things that we can do with this technology that we also will have to manage our customers expectations right the the industry has done a really good job at communicating what we are thinking and what type of services we can support and what type of capabilities we'll be able to expose with that comes a lot of excitement obviously from the ecosystem and our customers and now we have to make sure that we can explain how things work what's realistic at different uh points in the journey that we are just embarking on and uh and kind of how can they derive uh incremental value from these networks that we're going to be building and alex what future challenges do you see ahead you know i think uh miguel and akil captured you know a lot of the uh the the sentiment um you know and i share that um it's this is truly uh a journey uh that we're that we've embarked on and we're really at the beginning of the journey uh if you look at the short-term challenges it's really about making this complexity uh you know easy to consume and you know i think of that in the context of you know working with companies like erickson to deliver consumable solutions to miguel and then you've heard from miguel actually a completely new paradigm of making it easy for his customers for verizon's customers to be able to consume both on the enterprise side and on the consumer side and so while i believe that we have a a robust set of technologies that actually can come together uh in an integrated fashion to support this services based architecture that is the new 5g core network there's still a lot of work to be done uh relative to making it very simple uh to deploy to operate uh to manage to orchestrate and then on top of that it's um miguel talked about this as well being able to host services that we don't even know uh really have a good grasp of you know which ones will be the very successful ones so there's a lot of experimentation going on and so just to have the foundational flexibility to accommodate these new use cases uh exciting use cases uh that that 5g promises i i think will be uh you know will be an exciting and yet challenging uh you know instead of times ahead of us and miguel i just want to pick up on your your previous comment about the ecosystem what would be your request to the ecosystem to make core deployments easier and quicker probably my favorite question right out of all of them so so i'm going to start by obviously acknowledging and thanking the panels that are represented here right so we have intel and ericsson are both critical partners for verizon uh we have a number of efforts that are uh are ongoing with both of them right uh deploying new solutions and new technologies so a phenomenal amount of work has gone into getting us to where we are now and we all need to pause and take a minute and reflect upon the advancements in the technology with coding already at the same time we are demanding we are demanding customers we have a lot of expectations for this network all right so i'll start with a reference to my cfo if you allow me for a second right so our cfo always says verizon is an ant company not an oil company and so as alex and the kill have mentioned uh things that we have that we expect from the ecosystem is collaboration that allow us to be keeping an ant company and what i mean by that is we need for example to derive the maximum performance out of every cloud resource that we put in the network right we have to optimize how we use our assets at the same time and that will allow us to provide the best performance at the same time we need to do that while optimizing the price point so we can pass the service on to the customer right this is a competitive marketplace so that's that's a critical one uh collaboration has to continue uh some of the things that we've seen embracing open source the cloud native foundation uh tool said um leveraging the tools that partners like intel provides right so there are a lot of tools in the toolbox so how can we leverage them to ensure that that vision of a torque performing network that provides services that never stop evolving it's another key ask to the ecosystem and then kind of like we we all need to think about i guess in terms of open interfaces and open apis including ourselves as seminars uh so much what we are going to be building it will be the foundation for the companies that will develop the services that will write these capabilities to do what they do right innovate and offer creative solutions that solve pain points for our customers and a lot of these require us to be able to expose network capabilities apis and so on so i would say this this collaboration in the ecosystem where i think at times the the border between us customers and rental partners are no longer there we are both a customer and a vendor to our vendors we provide our platform reactors integrators so we can no longer operate in silos this is a goal that will have to build this network that will allow us to deliver the value of 5g and we added it together and we need to keep working together basically so that's my ask to the system micrologin how much progress we've made and this is good and we still have to do more in which they have to do better thank you miguel and also thanks to alex and akil for joining us and explaining the importance of the 5g core and its ongoing development don't forget you can watch additional interviews and discussions on 5g as part of the intel network and edge vsumit series for now though thank you for watching and goodbye you",

Lawrence gap went there for lunch one day and then we went back again for dinner so it was really good yes and then when the other right places we tried was Mamma Mia Italian deli and pizzeria so we have pizza there and a pasta pot pizza and pasta we kind of split it we shared so it was okay yeah that's all right not another favor another favor pretty news okay next is castaways Bar and Grill this is also right at the entrance to st. Lawrence gap basically directly across the street from Cafe Seoul but it's basically right on the water so a little Cove there and it was pretty good I had blind fish cutter this was actually better than the fine fish cutter at Toronto sure I think you had a pizza I didn't yes I think I mean why in pizza that day was pretty good but yeah I would definitely go back to this restaurant it was it was really good yeah I think the atmosphere made it even better okay next up is Bubba's sports bar bar we went here twice we went for the buffet breakfast and look back again later for another day for dinner dinner ate there for the buffet breakfast I mean it wasn't horrible it wasn't great it was just it was breakfast a little pricey for what it was at $20 a person us yeah which actually is creeks oneself and then the second time we were there we were there late at night for dinner and we ended up with the exact same waiter then next up was blankies on the boardwalk you walked along the boardwalk put some pictures of the the Caribbean Sea there on the south coast that outside I had put the head of course flying fish fingers had a pesto cream sauce some kind of I think was penne penne pasta yeah it was also really good there's a nice restaurant two centers we good to look at the beach and to see people passing by next up is KFC we're literally 100 miles from Kentucky yes and we went to Kentucky Fried Chicken in Barbados this was on debate holiday so every restaurant that we went to was closed we went to four places and everything was closed basically decided hey we're gonna run out of places to go so let's just go to KFC all those herbs and spices and Colonel Sanders so yes sir you stood in line for probably 30 minutes 30 to 45 minutes the problem with it is it doesn't taste anything like KFC it literally had no flavor I think msg must be banned in burritos and it must have all the flavor and that's where the flavour for KFC come from is the MSG okay so in Barbados their most famous fast-food restaurant chef fat we went to chef at five times maybe even say I think probably six times I have three flavors of the milkshakes vanilla chocolate and strawberry very oddly enough tasted like Laffy Taffy it's an odd thing for a milkshake I need a Pinot Laffy Taffy milkshakes so next up we went to bliss cafe we actually did an entire video just about there shanks yeah thank to it the cider over there if you want to watch the the video where we talk about the milkshakes and we actually recreated the milkshakes here in Ohio go to Barbados you have to go to blows cafe they also have these gourmet waffles that have all types of toppings and then they have milkshakes the milkshakes are not like milkshake 982 these are yeah they call them actually snazzy shakes they had five six five six different flavors we actually had a secret menu item so you'll have to watch the other video to find out why we have that but the most fabulous shakes you will ever see visually beautiful milkshakes so next up is probably the best hamburger we've had pretty much anywhere the chopping board kitchen at mojo yes mo Jo it was a hamburger and it was the juiciest freshest grilled hamburger rocky season they see the seasoning I don't know what they use on it it was so good and then it came with french fries and they served the whole thing on a chopping board like a wood chopping board that you would use in the kitchen if you go to Barbados check out some of the places that we mentioned definitely go to bliss cafe and the chopping board kitchen mojo that was probably our two favorites of the world yeah two favorite restaurants chopping board and this cafe now the two what was your least favorite those the other than KFC know that I can't see my least favorite would be Mamma Mia yeah yeah I think that would probably be my league paper or maybe the dinner at Baba's kind of cook Tigers they know it wasn't the best what's really great in Modena the breakfast was okay but yeah it's a kind of close tie between mommy and dinner make sure you subscribe and hit that little notification bell so that you're gonna get the notifications when we do upload more

inspiration for amazing videos and updates and share the pill I get to get notified for every new videos hey guys Shirley brought here you are watching inspiration as per recent news Appa is gonna bring its next x2 series smartphone as Oppo find X to light after x2 and x2 Pro they are focusing on the light version of x2 series the model is going to join the series with a different display design and no more hole punch cutout is here rather it is housed with a water drop notch along with the 6.4 inch AMOLED screen featuring with thousand eighty into twenty three forty pixels with an in display finger pin sensor the model would be surrounded by a thinner bezels on both the sides but it would have a thicker bezel on the bottom comparatively than these edges and it's expected the model would run on snapdragon 765 SOC integrated with x52 modern for the 5g support along with 8gb of ram with 128 gb of non expandable storage reportedly it would be a single nano sim smartphone without an expandable storage facility and primarily the model will be available with only two color options of white and black and as for this image white variant could have a gradient finish on the back it would also feature a vertical quad rare camera module featuring with main sensor of 48 megapixel where the other three would be an 8 megapixel wide-angle shooter and dual 2 megapixel sensor for depth sensor and macro sensor respectively and on the front the notch is likely to have a 32 megapixels selfie shooter but unfortunately no eius would be available here and with all this the battery would also be solid enough and this extra light will run with 4025 milli ampair power with a fast charging support and apart from this despite of being a light version the model would also be facilitated with some other features like NFC Wi-Fi 6 3.5 millimeter headphone jack type support etc unlikely it would ship with Android 10 with color OS 7.0 so these are some key specs that the model might have and hopefully soon it's gonna available in Europe expected with 500 euro so as a light version it would not be a metal built device but rest of the others are fairly good enough from memory to battery so it could face a good battle with some upcoming other light models and so the new Lamborghini edition is about to come with some astonishing finish and needless to say that could be a faster one where it would contain the same snapdragon 865 that x2 series uses and the specs it will uses almost same likes to Pro uses so basically this new edition would be feature with a new design and color and reportedly it would cost around twelve thousand 999 you one that is thousand and 876 dollar so much expensive model here so till then that's all thanks for watching see you in the next one

puppy requires a little bit of training we've not had it for that long so we're still working on it but how's it going so far it's going quite good but sometimes texture doesn't do anything it doesn't really respond is that because he's a bit of a cheeky puppy yeah okay so how do you turn them on so first you see this bottle and Wriston you'll press it any or turn on it okay so how do we make him do a flip so you hold these two buttons here down for three seconds until it beeps like that and then you put your up and then you can put it you put your hand down and he'll do a flip ha ha Olsen um so should we have a look at him doing a dance cuz I know you enjoyed that an egg so dads how do you do that versus bottom 120 d1 dot again okay this is how you do it twice now if you want him to come to you what do you have today do you remember as I come on man I think you have to hold us down it beeps and then you say text up come here but it doesn't always work that's cuz he's needs a bit more training doesn't he yeah character come here try him again texture come here come texture yeah I don't think it's gonna work okay how about heating his food okay eaters bone so you put this plane around like his chin and you have to move it around to find the place where it glows and then leave it there it's quite hard to keep your hand steady and find out it was Glenn - smells yeah Twihard finder okay what about okay has to be a bit away okay what about playing this ball for interfaces ball usually can put a magnet bit under the chin and sometimes when I play I get into me and I get them to get home that's quite key so should we have another get the voice commands okay we have done it lots of times haven't we yeah which one should I do so you have to press his nose thingy okay and then text the balk texture come here texture come here city something so texture come here naughty puppy behind in is changing with the words North to puppy to sit down go jump texture jump jump texture texture jump I think he needs a bit more draining yeah naughty passes huh so how do I get him back up now hmm I'm not sure perhaps you could get him dancing okay you won't do anything said overall he's quite good furnace and he what do you what do you think about the texture voice-recognition puppy I think that is really fun if you think you've got real dogging do tricks that song dogs can't do like this one if you are recommending this to somebody what would what would be the key things that you like about it the key things that I like about it is because some doors can't sing in it consumer and and it's really hard because usually um dogs will come to when they come and texture won't really do it they have to like trainings oh that's my thing I really like about him okay all right now I can do backflips that's awesome thank you", "a1uTH8jywaY": "mommy mommy can can i dress up like elsa when go see a new frozen movie no of course not why not because i'm elsa you can be

the swatch of kashmir gray and as you can see so pretty and it smells good too actually so yeah i've used this a lot so again here is the tiny bottle which i got in advent calendar and this one is the full size bottle of kashmiri you should you have to have this color in your collection it's a must-have i would say it will look great on every skin tone and just two coats or natural nails and that's it like you can do endless things with this again so yeah these are like very popular colors from madame glam i would highly recommend so now here i have their perfect white and perfect black gel polish and i have not seen any gel polish that opaque uh perfect white i would say you need three coats on natural nails but perfect black i just do one coat and it's just good to go and as the name say perfect white perfect black they are or very opaque colors so it's a must-have in your collection you will not regret it i just love these so next i have this glitter gel polish and this one is called earth day every day and it is a very pretty glitter polish this was always out of stock on their website but i finally got it i'm really happy and i don't have this in my collection so that's how it looks look at these glitters it's so beautiful so since i don't have it i'm gonna swatch it and show you guys how it looks [Music] so guys here's the swatch of earth day every day and it's such a pretty glitter polish it's not chunky at all as you can see uh you just need two thin coats and a top coat looks like it's gonna look great on eggs and nails or you know like just ombre nails now

i finally got it so i'm gonna show you how it looks so here i've painted perfect black on this nail and let's make it match and now cure it for 60 seconds so yeah guys i've just cured the matte top coat and look at this it's just so mad it just mattifies the nail really well and there's just no shine whatsoever and it's so velvety it does have this sticky layer so you just have to clean it with rubbing alcohol and you're good to go so the last item i want to show you are these air cushion nail pens so i've got four of these i just want to try these they seal these pens with this plastic here so you just pull it out and use it so yeah i'm gonna do that and show you each color so all of this pen has point five gram of product inside and these are chrome powder but in a pen so very convenient the only thing i don't see here are the names of these there's just no name i will find which color i got so i will put it on the screen for you so you can see uh which one i'm applying um so yeah these all these pens are vegan cruelty free hammer free gluten free it has like 12 months of expiry date from the day you purchase these so let me just open it and now here you just see the color so there's a product inside here and that's the sponge so every time you just twist it and bring more product in and rub it on the nail so here i have prepared my nails to apply these chrome pens i've put like half side black and half white so you can see that how it looks on the white and how it looks on the black and also i've applied a no wipe top coat on these because chrome pans you only apply on no wipe top coat or else it will not you know transfer really nicely so that'll be really interesting and can we just take a moment to appreciate the lines that i've created it's so crisp so yeah i'm really happy with that so let's begin the swatching of these chrome pans [Music] so i just dropped the color on the nail and if you think it's finished as you can see there's nothing left now so i'm just gonna grab the pen and just twist it like that and now you have more product here and then just start rubbing again so that's how it looks guys the first color is done and you can see how it looks on the white and the black it gives a really pretty effect i'm really loving it so pretty and after this you just apply on the wipe top coat and cure for 60 seconds and yeah you're good to go [Music] so that's how they look guys after i've applied a top coat i really like how they look the effect is really beautiful um the color on the white is more like pink and pearly looking but on the black you see a different color like this one is more orange more green and like a peacock kind of green and then more like pink but i really like how they turned out let me know in the comments below which one is your favorite and have you got these and it is actually mess free because it's in the bottle it just you just twist and just apply so it's very mess free and very easy to apply so that's all for the video guys and i hope you enjoyed watching my little haul from adam glam and the swatches of chrome pens and some of the new colors that i got i would like to know which one is your favorite color for madame glam and what color you always like to do on yourself on your clients so all the links i've put in the description box for these along with my coupon code so do check it out so thank you so much for watching and i will see you in my next video then bye [Music]", "Rr3pGQJJjZE": "- What's up, guys, Saf here on SuperSaf TV and inside here we have, of course, the brand new Samsung\nGalaxy S20 FE Fan Edition. So many of you guys have been messaging me asking me to cover this device\nso we've got it in the house, nice and early, SuperSaf style so a thumbs up for that\nwill be appreciated. It's in a pretty big\nbox, let's have a look. Got the Galaxy branding on here. I wonder what else is, Ooh. Okay, There's there's\nnothing else inside the box, apart from the S20 FE. But that's fine because that's exactly what we wanted to have a look at. And we've got some white packaging, which is a little bit different. We've got the S20 logo, S20 FE 5G. Now this is available in a 4G version coming in at a very\ncompetitive 599 pounds. The 5G edition is coming in at\n699 pounds or $699, however, if you do preorder early right now there's some crazy deals in the US. You could get this for $599. Absolutely insane, I'll\ndrop some links down below. Let's go ahead and open this up. And here is the device, we'll put that to the side for a second. Now, inside the box we have, firstly, a USB type A to USB type C cable. Then there is a 15 watt fast charger. Now, although this is\na 15 watt fast charger that's included out of the box, this device can support up\nto 25 watts fast charging. I'm assuming they've included this charger to save on a little bit of cost. So if you do have another 25 watt charger you'll be able to get\nfaster speeds on the FE. As well as that, on the top section, don't forget this top section,\nyou do get a SIM card tool with some people work inside here. Right, now let's get to the device, we're going to remove the\nplastic from the back. Yeah, this, it's not working. Now I've got the cloud Navy color here, which I do think looks really nice. We've got this matte finish but there are five other colors available so we've got something for everybody. And let's straight away address this. So this is plastic. What Samsung called glasstick, which is a reinforced stronger version of plastic, shall we say. And does it feel as premium as glass? Of course it doesn't. But personally speaking\nI'm not complaining that we've got this back for the price that this is coming in at. Yes, this is not going to be\nas scratch resistant as glass but it is not likely to\nshatter as easily as glass is. And honestly speaking, if you are going to be\nusing a case on this anyway or putting on a skin, then I really don't think\nit's going to matter. Let me know in the comments below if this is something\nthat's a concern to you. Now, we do have an aluminum frame however, so the sides of the device\ndo feel really premium. And then we have a Gorilla Glass 3 front. Now, why is this Gorilla Glass 3 and not a later version of\nGorilla Glass, I don't know. And there is a screen protector,\nwhich we're going to take off. I'm not going to try, I'm just\ngoing to leave it at the side 'cause it was embarrassing before. Oh, there's another\nscreen protector on here. This is the one that's\nsupposed to stay on. So it looks like there was\nan outer screen protector, which you can peel off and then you have the\npre-applied screen protector. So that's a nice touch, nice one, Samsung. Now we do have IP 68\nwater and dust resistance and let's straight away\ntalk about this display. So we've got small\nbezels around the sides, but they are not as small as what we see on the flagship S20 series. And this is a flat display as well, unlike what we see on\nthe S20 series as well. However, this is a 120 hertz display. 6.5 inches, full HD Plus\nresolution, super AMOLED 2X. And that high refresh rates\nwith 240 hertz of touch input means that things are very, very smooth. Now, yes, this isn't quite HD like we have on other Samsung devices. But then again on, say for example, my Samsung galaxy Note20 Ultra, which is almost double the price of this, that has 120 Hertz, but\nonly at full HD resolution. So I'm pretty much on full\nHD resolution on that anyway so this is not something\nthat's a big deal for me. And in terms of my first\nimpressions of the display, it's very, very good. Again, at this price it's\ndefinitely impressive. Now, in the display you do have an optical in display fingerprint scanner. Which seems to work absolutely fine. As well as a center punch outs\nfor the front facing camera. This is a 32 megapixel front facing camera with an f2.2 aperture. And let's have a look at\nthe rear facing cameras because we have a triple camera set up like we have on the flagship S20 series. The primary camera is\npractically the same. So it's a 12 megapixel\ncamera with an f1.8 aperture, dual pixel auto focus as well as optical image stabilization. So you're not really\ngetting a compromise here for the primary camera. We then have the 12\nmegapixel ultra wide camera with an f2.2 aperture. And finally, we have an eight\nmegapixel telephoto camera with optical image stabilization\nand an f2.4 aperture. This will give you\nthree times optical zoom and up to 30 times space zoom. So the S20 flagship series\nhas the 64 megapixel camera, or was it 48, I can't remember. But anyway, there's a\nhigher resolution on there. And that also enables 8K\non the flagship S20 series. Whereas here, you're not\ngoing to be getting 8K, but honestly speaking, 8K's not something that I use too much. So once again you've got very good cameras coming in at this price. Now let's take a look around device, on the right hand side\nwe have a power button as well as the volume rocker. Nothing on the left hand side. At the bottom, we've got\nthe USB type C input. There's the bottom firing speaker but we do have stereo speakers, so there's one in the earpiece and there's one bottom firing. And at the top there is the SIM card tray. Now this SIM card tray also\nhas space for a micro SD card so you can expand the\nstorage on here as well. And you do get 128 gigabytes\nof UFS 3.0 storage. For the battery, it is a\nvery large 4,500 Mah battery. So that is the same size as what I've got on my Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra, so a very good size which\nshould last you all day long. And as mentioned, we do have support for up to 25 Watts wired charging. Although the 15 watt charger\nis included in the box. And you also have 15\nwatt wireless charging, including wireless power share which is reverse wireless charging. So you are ticking a lot of boxes here. For software, at this time,\nwe have Android 10 with One UI and Samsung have promised\nthree years of updates. So the S20 FE is going to be coming under that three year update umbrella. Now let's talk about what's powering the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE,\nwhich is also quite impressive. So we've got two versions here in the UK. The first, which is the 599 pound option, is the Exnyos 990 version. The Exynos 990, a very capable chip sets. In this device at this price I am definitely not complaining. You've got six gigabytes\nof LPDDR5 RAM as well. Now this is the 4G only version, if you are not on the 5G hype\ntrain and you're thinking, my area's not going to\nhave 5G for some time, it's not something\nthat's a priority for me, then this is going to be a\nreally, really good option. But if you do want the Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 865 version, which as we know is the superior chip set, it's going to give you better performance and better battery life, then you will be paying 100 pounds more. So it's going to be 699 pounds. But that does come with 5G as well. Now, personally speaking, I would go with the\nQualcomm version myself for the superior chip set, as well as 5G. But honestly speaking, I think\nthe 4G version with Exynos is going to be fine for most people, especially at that 600 pound price. Now in the US you're\ngetting an even better deal because firstly, you're\ngetting eight gigabytes of RAM. You're getting the Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 865 version with 5G, and that is at 699 pounds\nbut for a limited time if you preorder, you can\nget it for 599 pounds. Which is in my opinion, an absolute steal for what you're getting in this package. Now I am of course, going to be leaving some links to Amazon down below so if you do want to go ahead and preorder this and pick it up, you can do that right away. It is going to be coming\nout on the 2nd of October. And that is the Samsung\nGalaxy S20 FE Fan Edition. My opinion, you can probably\ntell I'm definitely impressed at what you're getting in\nthis package for this price. Now that Samsung are in this\n600 to 700 pound price mark this brings a lot of competition\nfor the likes of OnePlus. So the OnePlus 8T, rumored to\ncome in around the same price. It's going to make it a tough decision about which one to go for. What do you guys think about the S20 FE? Definitely let me know\nin the comments below, also let me know what other\ncoverage you'd like me to do with this, SuperSaf style.

(upbeat music)", "LH2wn6rhQLA": "5g is the latest generation of mobile networks and it's a huge step up from what we have available to us today the jump from 3g to 4g networks was pretty huge 4g to 5g is many times greater and is almost difficult to comprehend 5g is an entirely new kind of network designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together be it smart devices vehicles even industrial machinery 5g will co-exist with existing 4g networks until coverage is expanded significantly but it will eventually evolve into a standalone network that operates independently the appeal of 5g mostly boils down to speed and insanely fast response times referred to as latency latency is the time it takes for devices to respond to each other over any wireless network 3g networks have a response time of around 100 milliseconds 4g hovers around 30 milliseconds while 5g networks predict latency figures as low as 1 millisecond this virtually instantaneous communication will open up a new world of possibilities for anything with an established network connection as well as benefiting our internet experiences the progression of emerging technologies will depend heavily on 5g living up to its expectations interactive technologies such as augmented reality and self-driving cars require extremely low latency to work effectively pushing 5g networks to not only hit their goal of one millisecond latency but to surpass it so how does 5g work 5g signals operate over previously untouched radio frequencies part of the network operates in a band known as sub 6 which is the spectrum between 600 megahertz and 6 gigahertz which is a spectrum that 4g lte also shares however only 5g can go above and beyond these frequencies into higher bandwidths which is what makes it so much better 5g can and will utilize a higher band of radio frequencies from 24 gigahertz to as high as 86 gigahertz resulting in far higher data rates and performance but with the trade-off of reduced range these new 5g radio waves can carry way more data to and from devices they just can't carry the increased load quite as far this means that providers have to install a large number of small cellular towers in close proximity to each other to actually deliver the network these towers hold cell sites that are about the same size as a pizza box they can be easily fixed to building roofs or light poles but each one has to be physically installed which is why the rollout of widespread 5g is going to take quite some time when these cell sites are in place they'll be able to beam signals to specific locations where they are needed most this is far better than how conventional radio towers deliver signal which is to spread it anywhere and everywhere regardless of site-specific demand operates on three different spectrum bands between 600 megahertz and 86 gigahertz while these numbers might just sound like useless statistics they'll end up having a noticeable effect on your everyday use especially in the early days of 5g the three spectrum bands that your 5g network will operate on are one low band network which is the most common band used by carriers in the us for 4g lte low band spectrum offers the widest coverage and best wall penetration but it doesn't offer any great shakes in the speed department 5g running on the low band network will only run around 20 faster than current 4g with peak data speeds topping out at around 100 megabits per second 2. high band spectrum which offers the highest performance for 5g however it's not without its drawback either highband spectrum can offer peak speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second and has almost non-existent latency but its coverage area is narrow and penetration is poor so to utilize this network to its full potential users will have to access plenty of cells that are all relatively close by and then slotting in somewhere between the two is mid-band spectrum which offers a balance of both speed and coverage mid band provides faster speeds and lower latency than low band with peak speeds of up to 1 gigabits per second on paper this doesn't compete with high band in terms of power but in real world use and for most applications it will be more than enough the coverage and penetration of mid band will also make it a very reliable and consistent connection as i'm sure you've already graphed the most prominent advantage of 5g over previous networks is the speed the predicted 5g speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second mean a 100 times increase in performance compared to existing 4g networks users of high band 5g will be able to do things like download movies in under 10 seconds as opposed to several minutes and seamlessly watch 8k 3d streams whilst out and about examples such as these are great for visualizing the power of 5g but it's important to remember that the speeds will also unlock the full capabilities of other emerging technologies including self-driving cars drones virtual reality augmented reality and of course the internet of things the internet of things also known as massive machine-to-machine communications is the collective connection of billions of devices without any human intervention this widespread connectivity has the potential to revolutionize how we do pretty much everything the internet of things exists right now consisting of around 25 billion devices but this is said to triple by the year 2025 and then continue growing thereafter another speed advantage of 5g is latency improvements 5g latency will be around or less than 1 millisecond which is quicker than human visual processing this makes it possible to control devices remotely in near real time while communications manufacturing and logistics will all reap the rewards of lower latency gamers will also benefit greatly from the 5g rollout the combination of high speed connections and minimal lag is the perfect recipe for virtual reality and augmented reality applications industries that use these technologies are due to explode in popularity as connectivity improvements make the experiences more seamless and immersive the connection speeds that 5g brings to the table is incredibly exciting but a huge aspect of 5g that is barely spoken about is capacity 5g will deliver up to 1 000 times more capacity than 4g which basically means more room for connected devices and users this combination of capacity and speed will greatly improve bandwidth which is the maximum data transfer rate of a network 5g can transmit amounts of data that would be inconceivable on 4g lte allowing for perfect connectivity speeds even on crowded networks people have always struggled with connectivity in busy places such as stadiums and festivals but 5g will be able to handle the demand no problem businesses also struggle with huge amounts of data that can flood in from customers and suppliers forcing them to turn away potentially useful information 5g will facilitate a large influx of data at any given time giving businesses the opportunity to turn previously untapped volumes of data into actionable market knowledge there are a ton of good things to say about 5g making it even more strange that it's being discussed frequently for reasons that you wouldn't expect there are many groups of people who believe that 5g is a toxic technology due to its microwave spectrum radiation and that it's going to slowly kill us all without realizing concerns surrounding cellular radiation are by no means new and truth be told nobody knows for sure how safe any cellular technology is let alone 5g 5g does emit microwave radiation but so does anything that uses 4g wi-fi or bluetooth the reason why there's so much concern surrounding 5g is because of the higher frequencies that it operates at bumping 5g radio waves further up the spectrum towards uv rays x-rays and gamma rays that we know to be harmful despite countless people being incredibly difficult to convince scientific evidence shows that even the highest 5g frequencies sit way and i mean way below the types of harmful radiation that are considered unsafe for continuous exposure so the only real downsides of 5g appear to be increased battery drain due to network technology improving quicker than battery technology however this issue is sure to be addressed and rectified within the next generation or so of smartphones underwhelming upload speeds which are only underwhelming when you compare them to the huge download speeds the 5d offers upload speeds of 5g will still be far superior to 4g lte the jump just won't be quite as significant and lack of widespread coverage currently 5g coverage is only available in defined areas of specific cities but the expansion will start to gain momentum again as we move beyond the restrictions of the 2020 pandemic carriers will start by extending their network coverage in areas with the greatest population and most users if you live or work in a big city 5g will probably be all around you before you know it at t5g is already in over 100 cities across the us with some benefiting from 5g plus if you spend your day somewhere a little more rural then it might be some time before you can make the most out of 5g but it will get you eventually full scale 5g rollout is expected to commence sometime around 2025. the price of data plans will also increase for the early adopters of 5g contracts which will get a little annoying if you keep finding your smartphone falling back on 4g networks but that's definitely to be expected during 5g's early infancy the bottom line of 5g is that it's safe fast and undoubtedly going to change the connected world as we know it you", "8M76cVzug-E": "the oppo reno 5 pro is 5g enabled and has

pickpocket pimps in the pulpit cult creatures that aren't telling you what's going on they're all complicit and they can't wait to go hang out with Donald Trump in Washington DC and sell us down the

wake up tomorrow and figure out Isis spend some more money on a domain Gary Delano grindell 61 has decided to join us tonight this is a special broadcast we're here to wake you up tell you the truth we're not going to tell you what you want to hear you were going to tell you what you need to hear folks Gary go right ahead all right while I'm here tonight because I want to talk about Donald Trump president it states some in this I'm really weighing on me really the last couple of months I kind of came to our realization and that is that Trump is unstoppable and we heard Mike Pence say that who is he talking to is it a with a Netanyahu he said that too it was a hot mic I think it was over in Israel and I think it was Netanyahu somebody really high up in the Israeli government right so and that is the truth Donald Trump is unstoppable and I notice some people they think that's a great thing but the problem is is a people in this country do not understand what his policies are so on the one end half the country the supporters of the president their attitude is well if Trump put his name on it and he signed it then it has to be good it must be America first therefore I don't need to look into it I don't need to question it it's it's the race the right thing for the country so that's half the country the other half of the country what I refer to now as the alleged opposition they they are not opposition at all and what I mean by that is when I talk to Trump supporters and I bring up these issues they always say well the media is so against him and all these entities and everyone's trying to stop him in the movies and the entertainment and the music and whatever right everyone's against him but the reality is if you talk to anyone that really is against Trump why are they against him in the first place well they're against him because four years ago he said that Mexicans were rapists murderers and drug dealers that's it there's really no other reason why they are against him they're against Donald Trump because he's a mean-spirited racist bigoted old white man that's why they're against Donald Trump they're not against him because he's pushing the that because he funded the Real ID national ID card they're not against him because during the campaign he was he made anti evacs is now making Pro vak statements they're not against him because you know he's he's pushing red flag laws they're not against him for the USMC a bill that he just signed they're not against him for pushing 5g they're not against him for spending more than any other president than ever before him they're not against him for growing the government more than any president before him they're not against him for funding the military-industrial complex more than anyone has before him they're against him because he's a racist that's it that is not opposition if the opposition actually could sit down and lay out the points that I just made we might actually be able to stop this guy a little more frequently but instead half the country says well if he did it it must be good the other half says well he's racist so the only people that are opposing him are people like me people like Joe and you know we're the ones that are laying out the real issues and because the opposition refuses to even look at his policy issues all they look at is is a race all day long there is no opposition because no one's actually opposing what Donald Trump is doing so with that said recently we've had this coronavirus thing going on and we've also had impeachment going on and during all of this distraction Donald Trump signed it was passed by the House and the Senate and it was signed by the president he signed the US MTA bill u.s. MCA is not United States Marine Corps of America it's the United States Mexico and Canada agreement now obviously I you know I'm aware of the scam of of Washington DC I actually lived there for a while so no one else had to explain to me how big of a scam the whole political structure is but here's what really opened my eyes very recently about how big of a scam this whole thing is a total SIOP this coronavirus combined with the impeachment with with the fact that they had all that going on and then he signs this USMC a bill I've talked to four people that are well one that's not but three others that are Trump supporters and I asked them as a test do you know what US MCAS nobody knows what this bill is it's a success it's a success exactly so and I said that during Obama's tenure that the the most transformative legislation that I that I had seen in my lifetime was Obamacare this u.s. MCA is on that level this is transformative legislation this will go damn this well this will be his legacy and so this was the SIOP I don't I don't have the dates you know off the top of my head but on one day the house representatives voted to impeach the president okay so they're they're telling the world that he's so bad that we have to have him removed from office that he's a criminal and that we're in dining him and that we have to have a trial that's what the house representative said on the day they impeached him the very next day that same House of Representatives led by Nancy Pelosi they passed Trump's us MCA bill so if he's so bad and he has to be taken out of office then why are they giving him his biggest legislative achievement of his presidency the one work he's gonna go out on all the rallies now and say I got us MCA passed and one more thing about that too during the campaign if very early on Donald Trump was saying that I'm going to cancel NAFTA I'm gonna cancel it that didn't last very long because probably someone talked to him and said we're not we're not gonna allow you to do that and that would have been America first canceling NAFTA then he changed his to and he started saying I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and that's what US MCA is us MCA is NAFTA part two now a lot of the Trump supporters when I try to explain to them what this guy is doing they they either say it depends on how sophisticated they are the lesser sophisticated Trump supporters they say oh african-american unemployment is is at record lows in the stock market in the economy and that's all they have because again no one in this country actually knows what his policies are the more sophisticated Trump supporters they'll tell me oh he got us out of TPP and he got us out of the Paris climate agreement now here is the con and the SIOP of Donald Trump so during the Obama tenure the they were pushing the trans-pacific partnership which if that were to have passed that would have put the United States and I believe either 11 or 12 other Asian countries into what would be a Pacific Union very similar to the European Union I don't think I have to explain to anybody here what is the European Union its we would be in that kind of a Grima there was a lot of opposition to that because everybody's sitting and they called the Obama trade at the time and everybody knew that was in the know that that was gonna eliminate American sovereignty and then Hillary Clinton there was a video of her where she said that the trans-pacific partnership was the gold standard of trade deals and that's what I was pushing that video like crazy because I was saying at the time if if we don't elect Trump cuz Trump was against trans-pacific partnership that's he said on day one he would kill that deal and then Hillary tried to pretend like she tried to walk back that original statement but it was already too late for her at least in regard to that particular issue so day one of Trump's presidency he actually kept his promise he he signed some kind of order saying that we're no longer in the trans-pacific no longer gonna do it and it's a little complex I don't want to get into all the details of it but there was something called TPA and then it was also TPP TPA was when the Republicans conspired with Obama this was Paul Ryan and what they did was they gave up all their authority on the negotiations they gave it to the President and and so Obama was a sole negotiator on trans-pacific partnership at the time what Trump did was he basically cancelled TPP but the TPA which was the the Congress giving up their power to the president lasts for six years so if we have a new president in 2020 or 2022 I think for one year could still reestablish trans-pacific partnership so it's not dead yet but basically what Trump said was he says he basically killed the negotiations so we're all happy Trump gets us out of TPP at least for four years and then what does he do he does what he's been doing for the last three years they took trans-pacific partnership they repackaged it they gave it a different name they changed the countries and in any just past it I also mentioned the Paris climate agreement because the exact same thing has happened he signed a of something or an order or whatever they do saying that we're not going to participate paid anymore in the Paris climate agreement and I'm not even sure if that's even happened or not there was a hard deadline sometime in 2019 which has since passed and I know for a fact that if we really got out of that there'd have been a big lefty media meltdown which there wasn't so I don't really know if they're uh if we really got out of the Paris climate agreement or not but but aside from that they then took the Paris climate agreement repackaged it renamed it and that is in the US MCA bill so the u.s. MCA bill is a combination of the trans-pacific partnership and the Paris climate agreement so for a few more minutes if you don't mind I want to explain what's in this bill so the first thing to stop go ahead this man is a political science expert continue please alright so the first thing that I want to go over that I had not gone over previously I'm not sure if it's actually new because I know things were pulled out and put in and all that and in between all this process but this is new to me and one of the people that I worked with fighting this in for me on this in this bill is something called the National Infrastructure Bank and the first time I was ever exposed to this concept was about three years ago we went to a an event with a local congressman Pete Aguilar he's represents the San Bernardino County area we went to one of his events and taped it and in that event he was pushing at the time this is back when Obama was still president he was pushing at the time something called the National Infrastructure Bank and I went whoa whoa what's that right and to this day I still don't really know what that entails because it never happened back then it was never really explained what it what it was and it still has not been explained what it is but I'm gonna speculate on what it means because I'm very familiar with this world of a Jena 21 agenda 2030 and the u.s. MCA bill is agenda 2030 and I want to explain very briefly that most channels that I watch that discuss this issue don't know the difference between agenda 21 and agenda 2030 they just think they're the same thing and they're completely two separate programs two separate documents so the twenty one program the one from the early nineties ninety two that Bush got us involved in that was all local so in your local City Councils pushing this environmental crap that was a Jena 21 the twenty thirty program is when your national government and internationally it gets pushed on you and that's what the u.s. MCA bill is it's part of the twenty thirty program so the National Infrastructure Bank this is what they are what I think they're going to do pretty much every city in the country is bankrupt because of pension obligations and unfunded liabilities and so as a result they gotta take the little free grant money anytime they can well I'm of the opinion that the National Infrastructure Bank is going to federalize the grant program where cities take grants and that's what makes us part of the 2030 program so let's say your city wants to redo the streets or they want to fix some kind of infrastructure when they go apply for grants they're not going to apply at a more local level they're going to apply with a national infrastructure bank and then you only get the grant if you go along with the terms of the national infrastructure bank and because the national infrastructure bank was created in an agenda 2030 document that means that you have to follow a Jena 2030 protocols in order to receive that grant money and so like I said almost every city in the country is bankrupt so they have to take this money it's literally dealing with the devil so that's in the u.s. MCA bill another thing in the bill is and really what this whole thing is so we're no longer have Pacific Union we now have North American Union with Canada and Mexico and it states in the bill that this is an economic merger of the three countries so Donald Trump goes out there and he says that this is the greatest economy we've ever had even though GDP is only 2.2 or whatever it is it's the greatest economy ever the most prosperity ever but then he signs a bill linking our economy with that of a so Shoeless country Canada and a third-world failed state of Mexico so do you think that by us doing that we're gonna pull up Mexico or as Mexico and I'm gonna pull us down and I'm of the opinion that they're gonna pull us down with them so we are now merged economically with the United States or with Canada and Mexico all you guys that are for the wall that are for that are for that are against illegal immigration the European Union when that was created that was about the movement of goods and people that's what this is this is though this is about the movement of goods services and people so if you think that we're gonna stop this immigration or illegal immigration for that matter President Trump just completely signed the death knell of that policy there's never going to be a wall now there's never going to be any kind of real fight on illegal immigration and there never will be any deportations going forward because think about it what was Trump saying in the campaign about NAFTA he said that it was a bad deal in that Canada and Mexico they got one up on us so that means that in order for them to negotiate with us we have to give them something and there's only one thing that Mexico wants from the United States and that is they want us to take their people that they don't want so all you people that have been telling me lately that Trump's in great on immigration that is building the wall he literally just signed away any forever there unless they overturn this document they're never gonna doing it I mean it's open borders for all just that's what the European Union is it's open borders for all eztravel across the 20 22 countries or whatever it is that's how it's going to be between the United States Mexico and Canada so it's an economic merger of the three countries and then the last thing that that's really important that I want to cover and this is all part of the agenda 2030 and Paris agreement stuff unlike NAFTA NAFTA that did not have this there is a chapter in u.s. MCA on the environment and it's States in the environmental chapter that the purpose of us MCA is the furtherance of sustainable development so Trump can go out there and say I'm against climate change global warming's fake but he then goes and signs the document stating that as a nation we're going to focus on fighting climate change because sustainable development is the strategy put out by the United Nations to fight climate change so for those of you that have watched my videos on the grind off sixty one channel for years and years and years you saw all the crap that they were doing in my city you're gonna now see that not not only on a local level but it's gonna be pushed on a national level so that that and so like I said this that's the SIOP the SIOP was coronavirus impeachment I mean come on impeachment I mean we all knew they were never gonna Allison Scott he just got acquitted today you know just today it just happened and in the middle of all of that this bill got signed and nobody's talking about it you don't see the TV talking about it none of the supporters are talking about it the haters aren't talking about it it got passed in the dark of night and it's just gonna be one of those like oh I I guess it Trump's gonna be talking about it but as he's talking about it no one's gonna know what it is and they'll they'll only know what it is when he goes oh I agree did NAFTA and his red hat wearing super Sonico yeah it's so voted for no this is not we you voted for you do not vote for an economic merger of Canada United States and Mexico and then let's throw the Paris agreement in there because that's that's what's in there and when I say Paris agreement it's not necessarily the agreement with that hope but Paris where we got to pay fees and fines and in many of these other countries but we're going to the three countries have committed to fighting climate change via the fact that it says that the purpose of the document is to further sustainable development and so that that's what I wanted to say to do and if you eat I don't know if you want to comment on that but I have the goody bag here if you want to change the subject if you guys believe in this if you guys believe this then you guys will believe Trump's a conservative populist libertarian fiscally responsible concern and so I I say to people now this is why Trump had to be installed into office because if Hillary Clinton would have went out there she wouldn't walk because back they'll be all freaked out the the USMC a NAFTA would have never been the issue because she was not she was not yeah the national ID card wouldn't got off the ground people be freaking out but this guy right but he loves it the nav the NAFTA issue was not an issue in the Democrat campaign the trans-pacific partnership was the issue and there was already a huge groundswell of people against it and now he just repackage it and so yeah have you guys ever been to us I'll take care of them have you guys ever been to one of those bars that puts the that puts the the cheap tequila in the expensive bottle and then sells it to you for $15 a shot because that's what Trump just did oh I haven't got a good one I heard someone else say this yeah I have actually haven't said it in any video so this will be a good time so what's happened is Donald Trump sold us a bill of goods and what we got instead was a pile of and for the last three years his supporters have been telling us how good that tastes that that's what's happening in this country in the latter years gary has broken it down in light speed in 20 minutes folks and this is a history lesson and a political science lesson that should be taught all high schools and colleges on why it matters that we know and understand what's going on with our government now everything the Donald Trump was installed to do Gary mentioned except for the World War three thing in the trillions of dollars for the military that was also given you know we were given a glimpse into so look folks I don't mind telling you that 95% of the United States is rural open space and if they give me any more the sustainability  I don't know what I'm gonna do because we already have 95% of countries empty that's pretty darn sustainable right we're already in recycling toilet water and I've got to go through carbon blocks and in in reverse osmosis filters every three months instead of once a year now because there's so much crap in the water I've actually got a filter the water to put in my garden it's so bad because it's killing the plants and killing the fish can't even have goldfish without filtering water folks they want you in a stacking pack they want it's sustainable and sustainable development means we got to get rid of everybody and the only way to get rid of everybody is a walleye man and shut the food supply down or poison everybody or eject everybody or radiate everybody I put these wicked lights in and give everybody all this kinky sex pornography and crappy food and drugs and pills that's why they legalize pot so you can stay on your VR and go off the deep end and then you know if you try to you know get out of that and you go to church I could put back to sleep with a donut a cup of coffee and they'll pick your pocket on the way out the door Donald Trump is doing everything he was installed to do he is the ultimate con folks okay he is the guy that's able to put the plastic bottle tequila in the $150 bottle and then the bartender serve it to you for $25 a shot and you're gonna sip it and go boom that's delicious because you've been trained to say everything he does is good folks we have the biggest deficit the Federal Reserve right now which is not federal and it's not a reserve it's a private central bank printing money out of thin air and they have inflated the money supply more than has ever been done in this country's history they're setting us up Donald Trump's talking about negative interest rates you don't talk about a country that you're president of going to negative interest rates when you were the world reserve currency when you're handling the petrodollar when you are the only country in the world that has a monopoly on currency issuance required for purchasing oil and you know he's talking about negative interest rates he's talked about three trillion dollars in defense spending you got to read the handwriting on all folks this there's all these diversions look the impeachment Barnum and Bailey's Ringling Brothers Circus okay circus clowns magicians you know ventriloquist's whatever you want to call these people on your satanic Black's crying mirror electronic psychotronic a Ouija board called a hella vision that you'd like to call a smart TV this turning into an idiot everything on there is just theater everything Trump is doing is very clever okay I voted for Trump cause you want to know something I like cutting taxes I like closing borders I like protectionist policies I like America first because every nation should have borders and should take care of its own because borders are biblical and the nation taking care of its people is a biblical concept and that's really the only role of the government is to maintain domestic tranquility the central government's role should only be dealing with national defense not this foreign policy that's got to spread out like the Roman Empire ready to collapse folks wake up oh don't tell me Hillary was it doesn't matter who gets in there think about this folks they're putting five G everywhere they're putting these weird lights and everywhere the forced vaccinations are coming the checkpoints are being built all over the interstates the Gunther the Real ID 2020 he's pushing sustainable development he's repackaged all this crap that nobody wants and he's stuck it in $150 tequila bottle and you're all sipping on it now I know a lot of my audience a lot I know a lot of my audience may not be drinking his kool-aid I know Gary's audience was very much on board with Trump in his policies but folks we've been had and we're going into a second term and he's gonna start a freaking war okay we just took out a General in Iran that's like somebody you know taking out the vice president when he's on the golf course okay oh you don't do that kind of stuff Iran has not attacked the United States okay he's talking he's not rattling sabers he's taking sabers and sticking them up people's asses folks this is crazy the only threat to the United State right now is from within and I'm going to repeat that one more time ladies and gentlemen the only threat to the United States right now is from within and it's from those who allow our financial system to be based on an illegal coinage of money that is a fiat currency printing press operation run by a central bank that is totally private let me explain something to you this thing called the Federal Reserve they got the Titanic sunk and got people on that thing at the bottom of the the Atlantic Ocean it was blown up and JP Morgan wasn't on the boat but all those guys are over Jekyll Island while there was people coming over on the Titanic to stop the formation the Federal Reserve that's why the ship was blown up and sunk it didn't hit no iceberg folks this Bank prints money out of thin air and then loans to the government and charges them interest in the government loans it to the banks and then they charge interest and then the banks loans to other banks they charge interest on it and then the bank's loan it to us and we charge a charge s injures then we launch to other people in businesses and we charge interest and before you know it you've got a ream of paper that costs about five bucks that's collecting about a million dollars a minute in interest and that interest is being paid back with our taxes and our natural resources because we give all this money into the taxation system and they buy up all the land and ninety five percent of the country is rural open space and guess who the largest landowner is in the United States it's not Ted Turner and it's not the Vatican it's a federal government it's the Bureau of Land Management they're moving us in to sustainable communities locking us into a Hunger Games model controlling the food supply and weaponizing all the infrastructure and guess what I know and guess what China is the model and what you're seeing right now they'll turn on the 5 g use the oxygen molecule absorption spectrum frequency hit it with a little modulation screw with people's breathing and blame it on a bogus virus and then say oh my gosh we've got a ban all the farmers markets we've got a ban all the wet markets we've got ban the local produce production we've got to bring in the troops we've got to build we got to build walls we lock you in we got quarantine everybody we got warranting the cruise ship take your airplane to the military base we've got a spray disinfectant all over every place we got to inject you all with these new vaccines folks this is where we're heading oh I got one for you on the vaccines I had a revelation recently III we talked briefly about it over the phone I don't know if you know or know I went to Seattle recently and so we were riding buses you know going around town yeah and the buses you know that they weren't overly packed you know I've been in cities where there are a lot more crowded but you know it was snowing it was cold Amsterdam's cleaner this yeah well Seattle was awful but uh you know it was and I will go back it was so snowing it was cold and I thought to myself I said wow I go you know look at this I don't what a great way to spread disease to have everybody packed onto a bus in the middle of a bottle right and so then right so the government runs the buses and that's all part of the 21 agenda 2030 programs to get you out of your car onto the buses now think about it like this if the government is owning and running the buses and and in disease is spread by people getting on the buses you know what's gonna happen they're gonna say you have to get a mandatory vaccination before you get on the bus as otherwise you don't get to go anywhere that's right now that that's where we're going but one more thing I'm not gonna do this justice if I don't mention it cuz I forgot about this fought us MCA I got sent this text today it says Jared Kushner was a while before I even say that it's pretty much well-known at this point that Dick Cheney was the real president during the George W Bush years and very similarly Donald Trump is not the president United States but president Trump's job is to go out while some feathers do speeches and sign and sign the bills but it is so it says the real president jared krishna was a key player in securing the united states mexico canada agreement u.s. trade representative robert light hyzer Torre's on october 20 18 I've said before and I'll say it again this agreement would not have happened if it wasn't for Jared Kushner is a key player in securing a new trade deal with China after seeing how cushioning was successful in securing us MC a tremendous aim on on Trump instructed him to work on getting a new trade deal secure of China so we got Kushner over in China yeah Kushner overdoing USMC a he's over in Israel in the Middle East securing up a new two-state solution peace but the guy's everywhere he's doing everything he ain't here this place is falling apart he's doing Jared Kushner is doing everything that is you're a real president you guys what's going on in the United States everybody's out of work there's all these homeless people everywhere the roads are falling apart the police are beating people up killing everybody and the court systems got lines out the door it looks like a sizzler buffet from the 80s right lines out the door at the courthouses everybody's being sucked into the system you know everything's falling apart and our government is all over the world by trying to reel everybody in and get everybody of their thumb folks it's Oh Gary why did you come over here I was having a good night I was gonna try to relax and you know just read some of the stuff that here we go here he goes with his bag to piss now these are most of these are pretty good actually you're gonna appreciate these you're gonna thank me for this one so I'm on the airplane and you only have an airplane magazine and I tore two things out of this magazine so this first one I'll just show the audience will quick what this looks like so it says the only nationwide 5g network t-mobile and I'm assuming they're sure it says t-mobile is the first alight of the nation with five you coverage coast-to-coast from big cities of small towns we connect more people than anybody else and there's always little dots on the map which I'm assuming is to show us where the the connections are gonna be so this is for you you can see this little empty area here you can see where the safe places are gonna be yeah it looks like Trump's neighborhoods safe I don't see him lit up like this old Christmas tree there in Florida right let me see that I didn't even look at Florida yeah there you go so there the whole state of Florida they're basically telling us well that also means that no supposed to live there either but uh but yeah so Florida there's a Holly 85g at least that's t-mobile you're also a Verizon 18 the other companies so that could obviously change oh yeah there it is right there so you have the little the little legend there with the now folks first of all I have to tell you two things okay number one Trump is not unstoppable even though even though they may they may think they are their stoppable because in the name of Jesus Christ by the way Donald Trump is a denier of Jesus Christ Donald Trump is not a Christian ladies and gentlemen Donald Trump is not a Christian he does not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ let me just make a point of that now number two he's nothing more than a puppet in number three his strings are very fragile and by the way his puppet masters are behind schedule and let me show you why you see the fine print here where it says let's see if I can there you go right there see 4G LTE they're using sub millimeter wave frequencies which is what we've been dealing with all along which are bad but they're millimeter wave deployments not here yet folks because it ain't working the way they wanted it to they want to get these millimeter wave transmitters all over the place and they're not anywhere yet you might see one every 10 miles they're behind schedule because they're crappy technology for their boss Lucifer who wants to be omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent is not working it ain't working the way they wanted it to so number one and by the way trump is a 5g  yg dangers calm has the declassified CIA document from 40 years ago that talks about what millimeter waves do they hurt people and everybody says oh we don't have any Studies on what this stuff does they are lying 5g dangers calm look at the PDF it's a downloadable 80 page document that's got all these studies it was done out of the Soviet Union experts in radiofrequency weaponry folks and I've got it linked up at 5g dangers calm and they're pushing this stuff on us and they're behind schedule because Almighty God and the atmosphere the oxygen the water the nitrogen the oxides of nitrogen the car dockside the bomb smoke the chemtrails the diesel soot and the flatulence are all knocking down the millimeter waves they don't propagate they got to use this sub millimeter wave stuff these microwave frequencies that don't have the bandwidth so they're not going to get their internet a thing so they can see how much methane come out your backside after your beamed in session they're not going to get what they want and we're going to pray against them getting what they want that's why they got to put con men in high positions of power to ramp things down your throat when you think you're getting Easter basket they're giving you a session of the electric chair folks that's what they're doing Gary just explained everything this guy did and he just repackaged a bunch of bad stuff into a birthday box and it ain't what you think it is it's exactly the opposite of what he's telling you when he talks about negative interest rates and he says hey well we're how come we can't have them I'll tell you what folks I'm not an expert in Keynesian economics but I know this if you hold the world reserve currency which the United States does you don't go to negative interest rates because guess what happens guess what happens where's all the money that's flowing in the Treasury is going to go it's going to go out so guess what has to happen the Federal Reserve's got to print more and more and more of it to prop everything up guess what happens when they have unlimited issuance occurrences they keep printing money hand-over-fist everything gets freakin expensive it everybody goes into poverty because you have a million dollars in your 401k and it won't get you a Chrysler Cordoba from 1978 at the junkyard that's my point folks this guy's dangerous and he's got the churches behind him and you know he's got the media playing both sides like it's his enemy this is all a rigged job folks the whole thing is all controlled this whole two-party system is to arms connected to the same monster I'm going to get indigestion if you take it what else you got all right so I before Seattle we went we went to Idaho to see my dad that's a nice place it was nice and I opened Karen he says because by the way there's about 500 million guns in this country folks don't turn him in because let me tell you something China is a model they were disarmed 70 years you know the the our State Department made sure that the rifles that went over there to fight the Communists had no bolts in them and so they were left to die and Mao marched off I don't know 100 million people to their deaths because they were disarmed let me tell you something folks if the American government tries to get your guns hand them over lead first okay I mean that it's a Second Amendment it's written into our Constitution people bled out barefoot in the snow under a cold blue sky for our right to defend ourselves against tyrannical government and tyrannical government is one that forces you to be injected with stuff forces you to think certain things forces you not to be able to talk about certain things forces children into an education system that breaks their brains and forces everybody to accept all of the lies of atheism social Marxism moral relativism cultural Marxism moral relativism and death education and all this gender-bending garbage has turned everybody into a psychopath I'm telling you right now folks hang on to your guns all right and if you don't have any go buy a whole bunch of them because Donald Trump wants your guns you know what he said he gave us the red flag laws race I say let's take the guns now we'll sort it out later let me tell you something folks whatever happened to due process whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty what's with the gold tassel around the flag in the courtroom next time you in a courtroom tell the guy to take that flag down and then start talking all right I'm going off on a tangent but you know what this guy has managed to get the mark of the beast this national ID card passed everybody he's managed to get these horrible trade agreements repackaged in and re ratified he's got this global warming carbon dioxide  folks carbon dioxide's plant food the more carbon dioxide will give you that thing I gotta say this I gotta say this I you know you shouldn't come over you I'm gonna have to that's why I come over once every few months you see this okay first of all where's all the carbon dioxide any getting trapped we're seeing trash the water should fall off the city air put that piece of crap I paid $5 too much for that thing folks carbon dioxide's plant food the more carbon tax that goes in the air the more the trees grow ask any marijuana farmer about the co2 levels in their growing systems and they'll tell you how beneficial it is and they're telling us that the crab shells are dissolving in the acidifying oceans you know have any of you ever had a swimming pool have any of you ever pissed in your swimming pool to see if it change the pH give me a break okay the only time the crab shells get soft is when you fry them in really hot oil and then you put some red pepper sauce on them then they go mm-hmm that's good go ahead Gary I've had enough all right so like I said uh my dad my stepmom my brother his wife some of my set mom's family on the mo go to Idaho and so because of California policies and my family has been separated but you will not see a bunch of highly paid activists and lawyers uh you know lobbying on my behalf because you know I'm not of a protected class just wanted to throw that in there because that's really what's going on so when I was over there in Idaho visiting them the topic of wireless internet and electricity came up and I was telling them how I got wires all over my house cuz I turn off the wireless and hooked up all the ethernet sand all the switches and all that and when I my stepmom said uh well why would you do that why won't you just have wireless and I said well it's dangerous and she rolled her eyes at me when I said that and I I kind of just knew at that point just kind of drop it cuz just there was really the I roll told me everything and you know she's in her 60s and kind of one of those things were she you know she's a set in her ways and I just wasn't gonna have the argument with her but I mean you sure well maybe I should but I just said you got to lose what all that pressure goes up she goes I was really there only there for two days I don't want to make you know our two days there about arguing about politics and this kind of crap so I just I just let it go but anyway so last night after we talked on the phone I was at sprouts grocery store and I saw this in the checkout stand and I was so happy because I was like people like my stepmom II to walk by and see this so this this is I bought this for you I bought two of them one for me one for you and so I check this out and go to a page 52 to see the words that's how I was I wasn't right there you just passed it 52 there it is this one hire an expert to measure levels in your home good idea purchased a meter to measure yourself good idea and look hard why are your stuff look at therefore I want to show you this so it says the about EMF damage and their first thing they put was look what it look what it was yeah sperm count cable modem give it disable bluetooth yeah this is good let's see who wrote this I think it was a like to go to the next page next page I think I think it's it's him Oh Mercola that's why he doesn't talk about what it does to the female eggs you see he's in on this too the first thing he says he talks about check this out by the way Mercola he's in on this so is the environmental health trust there's a group of activists out there dr. oz dr. Mercola Deborah Davis with the Environmental Health Trust folks the number one problem with Wireless are the eggs and our young girls and on Wi-Fi dangerous calm you can see the studies that show harm to eggs and you can see the corporate headquarters symbolism in the Apple Computer company's corporate headquarters in Cupertino Calif Gary you've seen those slides it's irrefutable I had a video up on YouTube they took it down I go sigh I go slide by slide on the agenda folks but go to Wi-Fi dangerous calm they can't take that down so the biggest problem with Wi-Fi according to dr. Mercola I guess here let's see uh check this out EMF damage can manifest in married ways which include many conditions that are occurring at ever-increasing amounts such as decreased sperm count now for those of you don't know this you guys make sperm every day so even if the counts low you still can recover from it what Mercola will never talk about and dr. oz will never talk about and I've seen dr. oz have a guest on his show and this is really disturbing he had a girl and a guy on his show and their talk about keeping their phones in their pockets all right and the whole focus of the show was the guy's phone in the guy's pocket and the girl was giggling about how it lowered his sperm count not once not once did dr. oz ever mentioned the female risk dr. Mercola not once does he mention the female risk when the female reproductive organs are the intended target of this agenda because women are born with a finite number of eggs you go to Wi-Fi dangerous calm and you will see what happens to the ovarian reserves when they're hit with microwaves and these people won't talk about it I'm glad to see this but guess what this does this does not address the problem in our young girls who are sitting in a classroom all day with an iPad right on their ovaries with the slot antennae at the base it does nothing to address all the young girls in high school and elementary and junior high with an iPad or a laptop on their laps it just nothing to address the young women who are in college who have a laptop on their lap in school and a laptop on their lap and all it does nothing to address the young woman who's trying to get pregnant at home is gonna laptop on her lap it's all about the guys you know what it's not all about the guys have any of you ever been out on the town it's not all about the guys it's about the ladies right and let me tell you in for good reason it is all right so listen this is good and I'm glad you brought that I agree with your point and I had a feeling you'd go in that direction but let's see what this talks about the five gene but the point that yeah as that the point is also this the point I wanted to make is to me it's just a good because there's gonna be people everywhere I go people are wearing those air paws the wireless earbuds that are giving them brain cancer and I want people to walk by and see that that that's that cover even if they don't buy the magazine just because a lot of people are not gonna buy this they're just gonna just see the cover and that could plant a seed in their mind that way maybe this stuff is dangerous so to me I get your point about you know maybe leaving some crucial information out but like I said there's a lot of AI roles that go up because to prefer a lot of people when you tell them that Wireless is dangerous they think you're full of it because I like they can't see it well yo Gary this is a step now I'll give you an example seven years ago I began when I discovered what was going on with the microwaves in these devices I began a quest to get the wireless out of the schools because the biggest threat to humanity at the time was not cell phones because I don't have my phone on my cojones 10 hours a day you know transmitting data ok I don't I'm not streaming videos while my phone is beaming at my balls is that is that why you bought a convertible car Joe I bought a convertible car so I get sunlight through my eyes oh I thought it was because you don't want to be in a metal box oh no I liked a live stream with the Sun and the wind oh I think it's really lacks thing I remember one day you're talking about being in a metal box well yeah that's why I don't drive one of those but anyway folks here's the thing we have a situation where there is a crisis in the United States right now there's literally about 50 million children that are forced to use a wireless device all day long with 30 other 35 of their children in classroom they're locked in there with these industrial-strength access points on the ceiling and they're being exposed unprecedented levels of microwave radiation and as it turns out Apple's infertility pad is being forced on their laps and we know what that does for their eggs and I try to get these people like Mercola and Deborah Davis and Joel Moskowitz and Tony Stein and you know trying to think of some other names you know I get on I try to get on George Noory and even Alex Jones we didn't know to show there the Apple corporate headquarters landscape architecture plans and the studies on the rats with a radiating their ovaries and then actually the girls are the one they're most at risk for permanent infertility that's irreversible from wireless exposure let me tell you something file is a few sperm I'll make another million tomorrow okay you know if I have a sleepless night I can catch up on that when I go out of town and I'll pull the drapes but if my daughter has her eggs burned up by some bastard in the school district that forces her to have this thing who refuses to warn the children not to put these things in their labs that is not a recoverable loss because a finite number of eggs are given to each girl as God makes them and they're burning them up and taking them away now of course there are other things involved with this the vaccines have a say have a part in this the blue light the white light LED lights at night all that stuff my point is is there's a cabal of supposed anti wireless scientists and they won't touch the female egg sterilization in the Apple corporate headquarters landscape architecture plans with a 200-foot freaking pool because variant on it they're in on it and they're giving you the red hair and hey look here look over here and this is part of it okay now granted Wi-Fi is going to give you a Somme Nia's going to give you heart to atrial fibrillation you're gonna have a fib teenager you're gonna have heart irregularities okay you're gonna have a calcified pineal gland you're gonna have weight gain because it messes up your insulin receptors but the worst thing that these microwaves do is to the young girls and there's not a mention of it in here now isn't that neat thanks a lot dr. Mercola oh yeah this thing's full of supplements too have you ever seen a frickin vitamin tree what is all this stuff what is all this my toe cues what is this enter power yourselves antioxidant spike supplements for crying out loud the minute that sucker gives it turned into a powder it's oxidized TR Oh styling cr\u00e9me a tackle thinning hair with scientific oxygen ah where'd you find this routes this is a rig this is a rig job oh yeah what's this a mood mood lighting was this uh face man's face are you freaking kidding me man's facial moisturizer man's body oil let me let me tell you let me show you it says it's hot let me let me show you let me show the purpose of this in my mind III know Gary our people are at different levels of what they understand and what they believe in and sometimes all you have to do without going in all that scientific detail sometimes all you have to do is just hold up the cover see this they're gonna give me a heart attack you see that I'm gonna have a heart attack from all this but sometimes all you have to do cuz you know just like I was trying to say earlier to a lot of people when you try to tell them about wireless they don't believe you can they can't see it they don't see it so if they don't see it then how can it be dangerous and it was a baby skip the problem is this doesn't take you all the way to the road and in a lot of cases the the kind of websites that you go on where you would try to show them the details they might just blow it off I've never heard of that website before but if you actually hold up a publication you know that says $7.99 on the cover you know you just you don't even show them the article just hold it up like this Gary let me ask you a question it might make them go home what Gary you and to me that at that point Gary you filmed that presentation I did over Calvary Chapel right yeah what did you think of that presentation it was good what did you think of what I showed in the presentation by Apple's corporate headquarters it's uh it's irrefutable is it not yeah it's irrefutable I rest my case what else you got in an end of in de baguette okay so these are all for you and then this one this one was also from the airplane on that same magazine and no I you'll appreciate this ones because this is same thing for a lot of people you don't have to go into that big long explanation sometimes just holding up a publication saying hey look at this it'll make people think twice and so the whole blue light thing if I would have never been exposed to you or ever met you I would I went to this day not know anything about Bob that issue so on my TV when you first turn it on the screens blue and when I get up early and if I were put the TV on that thing it hurt it's like oh you know Kay dad that color it really hurts well and I I never put that correlation together until you started talking about it I just thought it was pretty neat that uh this was in that magazine you know again without having to go into a big explanation sometimes just holding up a little thing it makes people think think about it and you know it's all about planting seeds their point to the at least because they might not have blocked your eyes for blue light here and I think most people if they see that ad they might just go what I got to worry about that for you know but it might at least make them think you know then when they hear it a second time do you see where that phone is ladies and gentlemen guess what she's blocking the blue light and she's radiating her breasts you see how they they give you one step forward and two steps back folks weaponers weaponry and you know I drive down the road I wish I would have had I you know is it possible you can go into the front seat of my car and give me my ski goggles alright go grab them where's your car open it's open I know it's locked forget it it's like you can't get folks all right look I I see this okay I'm not I am I'm happy about this but how much crest whitening strips with sodium on the floor phosphate so scale you because the way the way I look at it is there's three hundred and fifty million people in the country that are completely clueless they're all on these kind of issues and by the way I see some comments about your Oh and given what you're supposed to pray you know what uh last time I checked I have two thumbs and eight fingers and God gave me hands not just to do this okay you're supposed to break things that are bad you're supposed to unplug things that hurt you you're not supposed to put things in your mouth that are bad for you so you know we don't just go into the this big monastery and wish it all into the freaky cornfield you can spend way too much time in these phony-baloney churches that make everything this magical mystery tour Puff the Magic Dragon action look folks Jesus didn't go into the temple when he was pissed off and start praying he broke out the whip okay and Jesus raised the dead Jesus called the leaders of his days whitewash sepals full of dead men's bones the children of the devil a brood of vipers a wicked and perverse generation he called out the criminals and he also took matters into his own hands with righteous indignation and he told people hey go and sin no more he's ahead babe stop lighting these guys up and taking all their money and you've had ten husbands before knock it off he didn't sit there edge - Jesus was a guy that was all about action you know what the Bible says that there's so many things that he did while he was here that all the books in the world could not contain the accounts of them so we haven't even been given the half of what he's what he's done but I'll tell you this much I pray I'm spiritual but I'm not just gonna sit here and expect God to protect me as I jump off the Empire State Building and see how fast I can go before I head to cement it doesn't work that way if I jumped off the overpass onto the freeway at rush hour how long do you think God would protect me for think about it folks you know there's a time and a place when you're spinning out in a car accident and then it's time say father in Jesus name spare my life and maybe you'll just land without running into somebody but you know you don't do stupid things and expect him to protect you okay I'm sorry Gary go ahead I have a responder that I was just saying cuz you know and I don't I don't mean this as a disrespect but you know the majority of public is not ready for Joe ambriano to lecture them blue line in 5g but because it's too much for them but keep it where they want to sure but what the public is ready for understand and not that they're even ready for it but like people like the ones that roll their eyes at you this is what they need they don't even need an explanation just just just seeing that that it's probably dangerous they might even ignore it but then you know if it's being published like this they might see it a second time or even better I don't know if you're a Poli no these phones have blue light filters and if they see the thing that says blue light filter on their phone they might say well what's the deal with this blue light thing you know and then they start kind of getting into what what does how it's a problem and then as they develop you know learning about this they can then find you and that's when they'll get the real explanation but people would always ask me and I still give the same answer years later but people would always ask me oh I'm trying to wake up my brother or my mom or whoever you know how do I do it hey the bucket of cold water and a baseball bat well not yeah with a cup and a soothing herbal tea you know honey and and you know years back you know I learned the hard way that when you try to take someone who's completely asleep at the wheel and you try and you try to shake them it's probably not gonna work so what I figured out and this is just me but it worked is I would educate people on genetically modified food and the resi because like for exists so before I went to that route I look at the sky look at the lines and look at look at the water what they're doing to the water and water you know you know and all that stuff carry away over here hand up here they grab me that picture that's behind it right there take that down I wanted to careful with that and I learned right away that that pointing out the white lines in the sky it didn't work because the the public refuses to believe that there's something sinister going on or something sinister coming out of those planes fair enough but what I can't learn was that genetically modified food to educate people on that was with the best route to take because if somebody actually under stuff all it was the best route because everybody eats you know and that affects everybody and if you actually convince someone about genetically modified food the what ends up happening is they go wait a minute so they're poisoning our food and then when they when they get to that part to that point you have their attention where they say that sentence they they're poisoning the food and they believe it you then go you want to know what else they're poisoning and you go from that that's to me everyone has their own way of doing things or way of explaining things but that's kind of what this is to me you know just just just planning that little seed where you know some of them I go well why don't I worry about blue light I want to go have some salmon looks really good well you know Gary I agree I though even it's not it's not my job to feed people milk okay my job is to feed people you know the real meat and the potatoes but the problem is when you get stuff like this and I could tell you most people won't even open to the article they'll just see that cover and go wait what good because guess what here's the deal folks I own 5gb these people see this everywhere thighs dangers calm and Wi-Fi dangerous calm or my sites okay so you're right and I hope these people will drive traffic to my website so people can see what the heck is being done to them do you have anything else yeah I do but it's gonna upset you is why it's probably the worst thing I've ever brought here give me that tray right there that tray down there give me both of those you're gonna hit me with it after you see what that's the thing I don't think of this one huh all right go ahead I'm just showing these things why the way the Trade Center smokes I wanted to show you this picture what do you see here they're Hollow right the Trade Centers were Hollow they weren't full of all those people they talk about psyops okay what do you got all right well I won't even give you a hoe well I won't even give you an intro I found this in Seattle and if you open it there's things that are disturbing so you know just open it your own risk cuz we're all saying I don't want to look at this yeah I know you don't I'm done I'm just saying we're gonna deal with another time yeah that's fine no show show that what I just I don't want to I don't want to promote alright you know what the promoter could I mean I mean I've eaten I should i touching that oh it's mine anyway it's the only copy I have okay I'll look at it later you have to look at it I don't I yeah when I made the video where I showed this I made it I didn't really even make the video about this I just touched on it but you know it's just this is what's going on you know you know somebody that's got two snakes wrapped around a stick is not someone I want to hang out with so let's uh let's talk about Trump Gary yeah we want to talk about well um look we got problems right this is why make problems this guy's conned everybody he's got them he's got the money supply expanding like a loaf of bread with 50 pounds of yeast in it and that's gonna lead to hyperinflation that's going to be leading to a situation where housing is going to get even more and more commoditized and we're gonna have massive immigration with this trade deal that's gonna depress wages now I remember and see and part of that because you know and I've shown this in my videos Trump in the State of the Union a year ago not the one thing he just had last night but a year ago he stated I want more people to come into our country than ever before is know flooded and it doesn't matter if they got paperwork or not the fact is they're replacing Americans they're changing our culture here here in California specifically if you want to know what's happening to happen to the rest of the country they've legally changed holidays in our state because of immigration and they haven't they haven't gotten rid of Halloween yeah and forget that it's a satanic holiday it's our satanic holiday but we don't even have Halloween here anymore cuz now we got something called Dia de los Muertos which is someone else's satanic holiday and then and and you know around that time of year you don't even see happy Halloween anymore anywhere you see celebrate Dia de los Muertos so I agree so with this trade deal kind of getting worse there they might actually limit illegal immigration because there'll be no need to have a legal immigration anymore because he's gonna open the floodgates via mass legal immigration and he said that a year ago he wants more people coming in than ever before they got to do it legally and now at the u.s. MCA like I said earlier what would Mexico want from us they want to obtain my employ I want to empty their jails and send all right people over nice what they don't want us they want to get rid of the people that they don't want to take care of they don't want to deal with and they want us to take them man you know we got we got dispensaries massage parlors liquor stores bars WIC offices for The Offspring and hospitals for everything that could go wrong with these people that they're saying over here they ought to pay for none of it and you want to know something folks it's all by design it's all by design as you pay ten thousand dollars fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year for medical insurance for you and your 62 year old husband that lost his job because they cut them loose just before you could have retired and because you own a home and you have a few bucks in the bank you got to spend thirty thousand dollars you're on health insurance and these guys jump the fence with on the south Side of Chicago was the baddest part of town and if you go down there you better just be aware of a man named Leroy Brown now Leroy I wanted trouble you see stand about six foot phone all the ladies call him treat downtown level but the man just call them so he's got a he's got a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun he's got a razor in his shoe you see they're scented Leroy Browns over the border with a 32 gun in his pocket for fun he's got a razor in his shoe and you know they'll hit the massage parlor after they do there their cash job for day labor they may pack their nose and you know drink 15 mandela's and drive the uninsured Ford f-350 with with bad brakes and bald tires with a load of concrete right into the minivan in front with a bunch of kids in the back with no insurance and run away but if he wants to go and get his stitches fixed he goes to the hospital and he gets it all covered well you're spending 30 grand a year for medical insurance and $5,000 a year for the three cars and them and in the three children on your auto insurance with the uninsured motorist coverage folks look III know we stiii know that the white man stole this country from the Mexicans because the Mexican government gave the land away forever ban everyone stole the country from every other it's it's like but you know we gotta have some semblance but we may be losing our connection here hang on it we still are we're gonna wee-wee yeah we lost some people we have to wake up to what he's doing folks he's selling us out to foreign interests he's selling us out to foreign banks he's selling us out to foreign governments he's selling us out to foreign powers and he's letting all of us think he's got our backs everything Gary mansion in the beginning of this broadcast the first 20 minutes of this you need to play this to your high school children to your college students to your parents to your grandparents who are who are drunk on this Trump train which is really a crazy train folks let me tell you drunk people are too so another thing that I've kind of come to the realization a lot couple of months is as a country as a people their people did not have any principles in this country all they care about is if there's an R or a D next to the name and all go as far as to say that let's just say the next president in 2020 ended up being a Democrat and let's just say that president came out as pro-second amendment Pro free speech pro America you know anti-abortion the Republicans would hate them anyway because they don't have to have a D next to their name now let me give you an example of this actually in play so Ralph Northam the governor of Virginia it comes out in favor of red flag laws and thousands march on the Capitol great but when Donald Trump comes out against red flag laws not only does no one do anything they justify it by saying well it's for do you chest man oh he's just trying to show the Democrats that no it's the same policy yet when the art makes the policy there's not 50,000 outside the White House gates but when the D initiates the policy there's 50,000 outside the Virginia Capitol and like that made my point of course it did it makes no sense it doesn't make any sense polo she's tearing up a speech and yet she is passing his laws yeah they vote to impeach him yeah and those very next day they pass its most important piece I guess in the criminal is a great legislator because she signed his bill all right all right mostly I mean folks the reason that Northam did that is to get all the gun owners out in public so they could use facial recognition technology to figure out who to go and get the guns from when the day comes and they fell for it and it wasn't a good move to mobilize against this guy but Gary's absolutely right because when truck when Trump make statements like let's get the guns now and ask questions later nobody's marching on the Capitol nobody's out on Pennsylvania Avenue except for all the the strippers and the coke dealers because that's the only people that hang"}
