let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single

i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "olfWC1gd95s": "okay guys watermelon gummies this is a fun little recipe a little dessert that you can try you know at any point of the year especially in the summertime of my penis will treat watermelon honey and half of a lemon that's what's in the Vitamix right now I've scooped out one half of a small watermelon if you have any kind of remaining juice you can throw it in add it in 1 tablespoon of that of honey and juice of half a lemon I've blended a little bit of it and I'm just going to finish it off right now and then we'll take it to the next step okay so now the watermelon has been pulverized it is now ready to go so behind me I've got a saucepan I'm going to pour about a cup of well it's not supposed to do that it's supposed to be on a little bit of a lighter a lower temperature so now it is so I'm going to put about 1 cup of that in there the other cup is going to go into this pool here and what I'm going to do next is I'm going to add now don't ask me why you know half the girls in here a half goals in there this recipe comes courtesy of nick pinot and jen go man i'm sure they know what they're doing with this so I'm just giving it a shot and hopefully it works out the way it's supposed to you so I'm going to take half the packet of this story this is actually fruit pectin you can also use gelatin which i believe is about the same thing and i'm going to put a bunch of it in here and we're supposed to stir it up apparently so we're going to stir this all up really important that the mixture on the stove does not boil so we're going to warm it up just to a point where you know it's warm but not boiling and then we're going to combine both and i'm just going to make sure i use all this packed in because i do believe that you mean quite a bit in order for this to become a gummy so this these are literally going to turn out to be like gummy bears but healthy versions so really cool snack you can try with your kids a little fun ways to have your watermelon and eat it too nice little changeup from the normal desserts just let that warm for a second so what we're going to do next is once we have this concoction all done and ready to go we're going to pour it into an ice cube tray or if you have any other cool type of cut out trays you want to use that have cool bear shapes or spaceships soccer balls you can totally use that as well and we'll say that that's good enough I hope all right so that has been mixed and combined just can I get all that going together so ideally and normally what should happen is if you have enough packed and I believe that he calls for three packets of this in the recipe now i don't know if that's three full package like this or three smaller ones so we're gonna hope for the best here we're going to fill this up and we're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and it should gamma phi okay if that's a word it is now it should turn into little gummies kind of an ice cube format and if it doesn't then what we're going to do is we're going to just call them watermelon ice cubes because I will just throw them in the freezer and turn them into ice cubes so that we don't look like fools you know what we're trying to make stuff right so our ice crea is full this is probably a little bit too full so hmm well whatever I mean maybe it'll be one huge gummy they'll have to cut out so we're gonna take this we're going to throw it in the fridge 30 minutes let's keep our fingers crossed that it's going to work out it's going to turn it to a nice gummy if it doesn't the next time you see me it's going to be an ice cube and that's because it didn't come a fight but we'll see what happens cool okay so it's been about half an hour of taking these little gummies out of the fridge as you can see they're not fully gamma phi but they're getting there so I've got two options at this point I can keep them in the fridge for another day and hope for the best or I can put them in the freezer and no full on that they'll turn into ice cubes and we can just use them as watermelon ice cubes so if they don't gamma phi then you probably need more gelatin more Peck there I used three quarters of a pack again the recipe calls for three packets so that gives you an idea of how much you need I would say that if I use double the amount of pectin that I put in these would have turned out no problem so I'm going to keep them back in the fridge for a couple more hours and see how it goes hopefully they turn out as gummies if not then I'll just put them in the freezer and then we can enjoy them as watermelon ice cubes that you can put in with some kind of like sparkling water really cool little idea there for you so there we go we have our watermelon gummies hopefully the turnout for you and enjoy you", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "x9ghz27jrCU": "In the 1920s,\nGerman confectioner, Hans Riegel took\nthe world by storm with his invention\nof the gummy bear. These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy. And the rest is history. Feed your massive\ngummy addiction with a giant gummy\nbear on a stick. Made in the USA and\navailable now at vat19.com.

type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "XXvnmQLOfkY": "what's going on guys welcome back to a brand new video query contoso for those that are new to my channel my name is danny flores i'm a vlogger with no views but you could go ahead and change that by hitting that subscribe button liking this video and commenting down below over the weekend i was on live and i was telling you guys you know what i wanna i wanna buy some pika pika treats you know the mexican hot candy if y'all don't know i like that but uh yeah you guys were telling me danny why don't you just make them my you know what that's a good idea so my eyes went to the store right now and i bought all the ingredients so i'm gonna show you guys what you need for this and then uh hopefully you guys can make it and then tag me yeah yeah so sit back relax and enjoy this video alright guys so first you're gonna need some chamoy you know i got the chamoy um this is optional lucas i want to try with uh you know tamarindo lucas hopefully it's good but like i said this is optional so let's keep that aside and you're gonna need some lucas mango uh you know the mango flavors bomb and honestly for your candy you could use whatever you want but you know i got the watermelon sour patch kids the reason i got the watermelon sour patch kids is because i don't know if you guys try the paleta the watermelon the sandia that has a chili limon and i was like damn that's gonna that's hella bomb that's one of my favorite palettes so i'm like you know what i'm gonna try to make it like that the same thing hopefully it comes out good so uh yeah we'll see what the sour patch kids uh watermelon you're gonna need some powdered sugar and we can't forget the tahin and not the tajin not the tajin the tahin all right so what you guys want to do first is go get yourself a spoon because you're going to need five tablespoons of this powdered sugar um guys honestly i used to eat powdered sugar called some waffles fire if you haven't tried your freaking waffles with powdered sugar go try them because it's bomb so you're gonna place the five tablespoons on here let me do that real quick because about a voyage and uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna get messy after you put your five tablespoons of powdered sugar which it looks like this then you're gonna put two tablespoons of chamoy so let's get it guys i don't know if you guys like eating chamoy by itself but honestly i don't it's just too much for me um but i do like the lucas of the tamarindo one by itself fire that's hella bomb but yeah here's my second one all right and now when you have it like this guys all you want to do is mix it up make sure it's blended together make sure you have a lot of napkins okay i'm making a whole last mess look at the mess i'm making guys but you know what i mean i it looks like i put too much powdered sugar so all i'm gonna do is add some more chamois because you want it to be like liquidy and you don't you just don't want it to like you know you want it to all mix together because it it's gonna see liquid but no you have to just keep mixing it guys so let me mix it and then i'll show you guys when i'm done with it oh it's mixed now and now what you want to do is put it in the microwave for 10 seconds not 10 minutes 10 seconds uh so i'm gonna go put that right now real quick and show you como se mita because honestly i'm gonna explain why you need to put in the microwave 10 seconds i see no mas all right guys but after you take it out same thing mix it over again it smells good because of the chamoy fire you guys might be asking me danny why are you using powdered sugar yeah didn't sugar the candy well you want to use a powdered sugar pacquiao chamois candy for quesadilla it's just going to be dripping down you guys will see after i'm all mixing it but yeah it makes sense when you see it i mean i was like damn why do i need powdered sugar don't get me wrong i did do some research on how to make these and yeah i was like why the hell do i need powdered sugar for the yachting and sugar all right let's let's go to the next step okay so garden container where you could close it because you're gonna need to mix all the candy in it so i'm gonna open this candy and uh put some in here remember guys you could use any candy i'm just using this because uh la paleta de san dia fire so i'm gonna i'm not gonna put a lot just because well i'm gonna lie [Applause] guys so i put this many no mucho um just because i don't wanna a lot today so mas and then what you want to do is pour some of this pour your chamoy on here and then batalo trabes and yeah i see like that make sure your chamois gets everywhere guys so the chamois is going to be the main ingredient pacquiao in the candy so like your lucas your tahini and then yeah that's why you use powdered sugar cuando ya cabes is supposed to look like this fire hella good so then you start adding your tahin as much as that hinge you want and same thing with this as much as look as you want okay guys so i'm gonna put a lot of tahini just because i like my sour oh oh okay all right put that in and then obviously mix it up like that could go everywhere oh my god i can't wait to try this all right once it has enough tajin um go ahead and put your lucas the mango flavor my favorite one after school i used to buy one of these and a cocoa whoa good ass snack but these kids nowadays no salmon okay right so now you're going to put your mango right here your lucas oh my gosh this is fire okay guys asi se mira wow look at this i know your mouth is watering so my bad but then the tapas and then you obviously you shake it down look how it looks all right so moment of truth before i put the lucas tamarindo i'm gonna try it first without it and hopefully i mean it's gonna taste fire guys i know it's gonna taste fire wow oh so good guys hella bomb oh my god i i should start sending these for real man if y'all didn't know back in middle school i used to sell sour gummy bears or you know actually um i used to sell spicy gummy bears con eso le ponia tapatio lo que sia kool-aid if y'all want me to make a like a chili type of you know hot spicy uh gummy bear let me know and i will make it because i have all the ingredients right here well except for kool-aid i need to go buy kool-aid pero i'm gonna put some more tajin because same with the lucas since i already tried it like normal i'm gonna try this i'm gonna add this um but like i said guys you really don't need this i just want to try my let's see how it tastes so let me open this real quick you lego throw some in there l memories memories i haven't had one of

guys made it to the end of the video and for those that made it thank you so much for the love and support but i do want to you know get a little little serious well i want to have a little talk with y'all just because i've seen this going around everywhere twitter um facebook instagram you name it all social media this week yeah i think it was yesterday there's a there's a situation where this orderly man got uh jumped basically beat up by two african americans and um yeah it just it just sucks i hate it guys this is not the first video i watched i actually watched another one yesterday too where uh three latino guys are hispanic um they got jumped by 20 african-american guys outside a liquor store and it's just wack it's a whack i hate i hate watching those videos and don't get me wrong i'm all black lives matter guys i stand for the movement i do recognize just because those few individuals of that african-american descent did something not all african-americans are like that same with us vice versa not all mexicans are like the mexicans trump says we are but la puraneta like it sucks having to watch those videos because they there's been a uh another elotero man and there's been a lady there's been a another guy another um older gentleman selling um i believe was mask oranges i don't know somewhere in the street but it just sucks because i know that not a lot of influencers are gonna bring awareness to this so i'm here with my 12 000 subscribers account bringing awareness to this because this  has to stop la puerta de planeta has to stop because how are we gonna unite if we keep and we keep fighting each other we have to fight together to make a change in this world to impact this world um just because you know our own damn president is racist honestly he's hella racist he doesn't like us he doesn't like us he doesn't like us minorities and it just sucks and then he watches those videos and then he's gonna be like oh there's a minority in minority crime okay but i just want to bring awareness to this guys and i don't know if you guys seen the videos but it's heartbreaking it really does suck um i believe he has a gofundme account um i'm not too sure which one specifically because i know jimmy and me the open one and i know a lady that worked with him actually opened one tamiya so um i don't know which one to donate to but i'm pretty sure one of those two is still gonna get to him he's still gonna go to him so um this upcoming friday when i get paid obviously i'm gonna you know send some money out hopefully it's still up i get paid till friday but i just wanted to talk a little bit about it just because it it it's devastating it sucks like i said we have to be together we have to be united as one so we could overcome all the bs they have against us minorities but at the end of the day guys like i said just because you guys see those individuals doesn't mean all african americans are like that obviously it's those people are hella bad they're they're pieces of yes i understand don't blame the rest of them just because of them and honestly i feel like these guys um if you guys don't know these guys were in long beach and guys i know some people are going to go after them but just be careful out there and do what's right in the world don't be stupid and yeah just i don't know that's all i got to say i guess", "KAycqbqNaes":

Good bye.", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time",

Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power [Music]", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "PoDEhYvmUz8": "[Music] so where we help you make sense of your dispensary YouTube's first and only marijuana edible review show that might be true I don't know there might be somebody else doing it but we definitely have the most videos so take that whether what you will today guys we are taking our look at our final look at cannabis quencher at least for now we are gonna take a look at their 200 milligram old-fashioned lemonade here from cannabis quencher this is I believe the fourth maybe the fifth review we've done from them I've loved all of their products I'm gonna go and take a rest after this one if this one's great we know that cannabis quencher is a-okay and we can stick with them if they release new products in the future we might take a look at them but this will be our last look at cannabis quencher and so guys this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna drink this bad boy some bit of it in front of you let you know how it tastes I'll be sure to drink it all over the next few minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you actually know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process or in this case the drinkable review process so let's take a look here at cannabis quencher you can see here this vegan gluten free product ooh-la-la we've got the gondolier on the back again I still have no idea what the gondolier has to do with cannabis glacier pieces life like most drinks these days is just too complicated take a trip back into simpler times with our old-style lemonade I intend to shake well let's go back to older simpler and more high times lemonade lemonade lemonade weed weed weed weed that's the way be focus right there oh no it's May design here to rescue somebody fire department actually get em boys I'm gonna finish this and I will see you guys in two hours let you know how we're feeling and I gotta say this might have the most pleasant and least weeds the aftertaste of any of the cannabis quencher products so far so that's good I will see you guys in two hours though to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis quencher 200 milligram lemonade and I am more than happy to tell you it's just as good as all the other cannabis quenchers all the flavors uniformly excellent do not hesitate to grab cannabis quencher if you're not afraid of trying a drink at a dispensary near you I think they're great they're a little bit pricier than the confectionaries but but they are good for a nice change of pace and they're not quite as filling as the sort of confectionaries like the brownies and cookies as well so I like them as a good alternative here and there and the cannabis quencher is the sort of drink that I now go for when I would like a bowl that excuse me a drinkable I'm gonna go with cannabis quencher so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw this at the camera I'm just gonna do that hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below

officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "H8EhvA8Tp-I": "what's going on y'all it's brandon we got something a little different today today we're taking a look at my recent purchase from guys at boston empire this is watermelon d8 gummies 25 milligrams each let's see one of them right there and the cool thing about these guys man they sent um some places send their you know the edibles in where basically you've gotta cut it apart after it's baked you know within the being [ __ ] but these guys put it in a cooler mailer it also had these inside as well wrapped up so they stayed cool absolutely no issue of course came in the box like that but absolutely no issue with it you know them being melted together or having to cut them apart i mean perfect you know way of thinning it and see if i can get it here directions take half or one gummy every six hours if needed at least wait an hour before taking more we got the analytics right here [Applause] the delta eight gummies and i just seen there they've got a um the blue razz ones out now these were the uh watermelon as you can see all the information right here a little bit of doubt denying a little bit of delta eight and these things are are fire man they really are like um i've actually been using i

same night I've already taken her milligrams THC and have milligrams of CBD and I'm gonna vote to try this brownie which I'm really excited about it is supposed to have any I want to check for you 200 milligrams of THC this is the Bernie and this is the Bernie I'm really excited either there's more like fudge then a brownie but I'm sure this bomb I was really really good like dangerous good Mike never got apples before this could kind of be a little dangerous because I definitely don't really taste the weed in this which is really surprising I think it's because it's brownie but yeah it's definitely like a fudge more than anything it was like really moist it was really easy - mm-hmm so hopefully the potency is as good as it tastes it was to go to hand in hand then this would definitely be a reprieve for me because I love chocolate and I am a huge fan of fudge and this is [ __ ] delicious like this could be very dangerous mmm dose it's the name of the company I can't double yeah definitely definitely really good I'd say I would like this over the watermelon because I'm going to eat this whole thing in one sitting which as I said if you are somebody that does not have a high tolerance I don't really recommend doing something like this because some people don't react well to edibles and you just save which is cool like it really doesn't matter but definitely if you're like just getting into the edibles world like please please please take things slow we do not want to hear stories of mom not being able to really function in the morning because she's still very very very high which sometimes does happen or absolute worst case scenario you completely trip oh and you ever the hospital like that is something we do not want to see and we do not advocate for here we want to see good slow medicating especially if you do not have that tolerance if you are somebody that is just getting into this please do not do what I am doing and please do not sit here and eat the entire brownie because if you do you might get a little bit too high and for some people they don't really like that I mean personally I'm like yeah let's do it like let's get popped out but some people are like no not my forte I don't want to sit there and like zone out and not be able to move or personally like I move which whom I actually I wasn't sitting here my foot is like literally bouncing I don't sit still so for me mm-hmm definitely win I don't say packaging there isn't a lot of it I'm going to only hang with this this and this piece so there's a lot of time in time packaging which is good I love and if my kid tried to grab this you probably wouldn't even know how to open it like I actually took me if you mess be like okay how does this open because besides don't open just like literally rip it open from the bottom which is good because sure happens sometimes we live things and our children's reach which accidents happen nobody's perfect that's why I always say like there's never allowed any judgement because accidents happen [ __ ] happens in the obvious", "JdISM7UWDaQ": "[Music] the matter one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are not taking my advice and we are looking at a gummy edit pure for the first time we're looking at up here I've actually had people tell me that ed up yours is their favorite gummy and that is a gummy that is actually potent I guess be watch weights before you've seen in my other gummy reviews you know I find them a pretty lackluster to be honest I never really thought one to be as potent as advertised so I come to Ed appear with as cautiously optimistic as one can be excited but not overly you know I've got some reservations so this is a two hundred and fifty milligrams edible the watermelon belts from Ed appear it cost me I believe about about twenty dollars so it's an expensive edible expensive gummy edibles so hopefully that means it will be more potent as I said never had a head up here before I had had several different gummy brands so this is the first time they had a bunch of different gummies they're from Ed uh pure I picked up a bunch to do some reviews so look forward to those in the future and if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our abuse work is I'm gonna down this product here this time I think I'm gonna just gonna eat the whole thing in front of you guys cuz it's only five belts and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes so without further ado let's open this bad boy up and give it a taste and it looks like okay packaging is easy to open which is always nice so here we are here here's the little rainbow belt or the excuse me watermelon belt there are five of them in here each with 50 milligrams of THC or so they are as advertised here we go mmm that is rough those do not taste good there's a heavy we tasted that and guys if you will excuse me I forgot ahead of time as with all my gummy reviews I like to have a little bit of fat before I eat the gummies because I believe the fat is a good vessel for the for the THC to sort of be impacted in your bloodstream in your liver and so forth so uh if you excuse me for just a moment I'm gonna go grab some fat and I'll be right back I'm back with a spatula and some Nutella let's get some fat in me before I even need more of these gross OHS mmm now that is a good taste who doesn't like Nutella just gotta get a little bit more of me all right that's ingesting so you guys can see I will be ingesting these rainbow belts use me watermelon belts under optimal conditions now let's go ahead and eat a couple more here those are terrible Wow Wow it is like eating liquefied weed oh boy man that means they have potent okay guys well I am going to finish the last three of these here and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these are feeling because that is the most important part of any edible review not the way it tastes but the way it makes you feel so guys with that I will see you in two hours peace guys it has been two hours since I had the head of pure watermelon belts and I'm not sure that they're going to change my opinion on candies or gummies but they are more potent than the infused creations or voodoo sours that I've had and reviewed in the past so that I definitely feel something so that is certainly an improvement over those it's still just not as potent as other 250 milligram a tea bowls that I've had just doesn't compare to tons of like brownies cookies whatever sort of in the confectionary genre but I do want to give better pure credit for being the most potent candy that I've had so far even if it's not as potent as it would be in similar milligram form and like a confectionery product and they taste it awful they tasted straight-up disgusting just just like weed I mean weed in a gummy form it was just really gross but again so if you really like gummies or candies go with the ED appear over infused creations or voodoo sours because these are definitely stronger for sure but for me I think I'm gonna stick with confectionaries however I do have a or at appear to review so we'll be sure to get those reviews out to you as well and let you know if those products are more potent than the watermelon belts until then guys thank you so much for watching wheat and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "hsEAWR1_W7s": "hey Kelly and today we're in the sports research kitchen and we're going to be making homemade watermelon gummy using our beet gelatin collagen protein here's what you'll need fourth research beef gelatin a whole mini watermelon lemon and honey the first thing you're going to do is liquefy the fresh watermelon [Music] after you have it done pour it through a mesh strainer to discard the pole [Music] next we're going to skim off the white foam now you should have about two cups of watermelon juice and we're going to separate it by putting one cup into the saucepan now it's time for the beef gelatin you're going to sprinkle five tablespoons for the remaining order melon juice now you will let it rest and it will start to solidify okay let's go take care of the other half now that I've heated up we're going to add the other half of the gelatin mixture now you can whisk it until it's smooth next we're going to add a half a cup of lemon juice and we're using honey but you can use any sweetener that you [Music] okay we're almost finished all we have to do is pour the gelatin into the mold and place them in the freezer for 39 [Music] alright guys they're all finished and they're delicious they're filled with protein amino acids and collagen I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe and I'll see you guys next time [Music]", "_RUjGvspR7g": "hey guys ever since I made orange jello I've been dying to try different variations and this watermelon jello that we're making today is perfect for summer I'm Megan I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so let's both our ingredients you'll need a whole seedless watermelon coconut water and unflavored gelatin so the first thing we need to do is slice into our watermelon make sure that you're getting a seedless watermelon so you don't have to find all the seeds so I'm going to take a really heavy knife and cut right through once my watermelon is sliced I'm scooping all the flesh right into a blender so I'm going to bring it down and I'm just gonna use a spoon to do this with but I'm really gonna dig in here and get everything out so I've really scooped every bit of watermelon flesh that I can out of the watermelon you'll also notice that there's some pure watermelon juice left behind and what I'm gonna do is to put that right through a strainer into my container so I'm going to dump it in and then I'm going to use a really high-powered blender to puree the water mine once my watermelons pureed I'm gonna pour it through a strainer and that's because I want a really pure juice so there's not a lot of texture in my jello my juice has been strained but I want a very very pure juice otherwise the texture is not quite right in the jello and I experiment too many times so I know so what I'm gonna do is dump out the dregs of this into my sink and then restrain it through here until I have about two cups my juice is finally ready and I'm going to combine it with my gelatin next now I am using a grass-fed gelatin today because you guys commented in my orange dollar recipe that this is the kind I should be using and I take your comments very seriously so it's what I'm using today I'm going to sprinkle it right in my pan and to it I'm gonna add my watermelon juice and finally I'm gonna add a little bit of coconut water this is because even though the watermelon juice has been strained it's a pretty thick juice and this helps send it out I'm gonna let this sit for about two minutes for the gelatin to dissolve before putting it on my stove I'm gonna turn the burner on low and whisk constantly for about five minutes my jello mixture is all melted and next I need to pour it into my container my vessel which is my empty watermelon what I'm gonna do is Pat it dry because I have found that if you don't have a really dry really clean that watermelon the jello just kind of slides off it tends to do that anyway but this really helps it stick a little bit more you can see that I put my watermelon in a bowl that's so I don't have to hold it while I pour my jello in all that's left to do is let your jello set in your refrigerator for about four to six hours my watermelon is out of the refrigerator you can tell my kids gotcha before I was able to show you guys the final product but I hope your kids love it as much as mine do it's a true testament to what a fun summer treat it is thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye guys", "MJ_hYPilaHk": "number two second day of ghost energy flavor reviews it's already been revealed it's not really much of a reveal but if you can guess from the colors in the background you'll be right sour watermelon warheads is here see if we can focus on this there you go i'm not very much of a sour sour person i guess some people would say i'm sour on the internet [Music] welcome to price plow but in terms of flavors i've never really been a big sour person um if you remember watching the uh burn video where i did the sour watermelon burn with with mike oh i didn't handle it very well wow but at the very least you might enjoy watching me pucker up i don't know if i'm gonna enjoy this one but we'll see so without further ado let's crack this one and get it got a little bit on the lens right there clean that up cool well i can smell it already definitely watermelon definitely sour i don't think i need to tell you guys all about the uh active ingredients in this one if you do want to learn more about the active ingredients you can run over to the previous one where i talked about in tropical mango and gram of alcar amazing hologram of touring you watch any of my pre-workout videos you know that i love touring it's incredible for all things athletic related neuro factor 100 milligrams this stuff is amazing and lastly estrogen very interesting data to be coming out soon on what uh estrogen can do to help increase the bioavailability of some other ingredients that you may not have considered already or if you actually can even go to the sirs episode where we have dan on from goes we talk all about the formulation the creation of the product so let's send this one down the hatch oh that's a lot of citric acid and malic acid i mean i could drink a couple of these if i want really needed it i've got a couple in the case that i got to drink it's not my favorite it's really sour it's just not my thing i mean i'm gonna finish this one be honest with you because i like the effects but in terms of like good flavors the citrus the tropical mango they definitely win for me now i thought this is inaccurate it's very accurate it's a little sour watermelon warhead i'm just not a warhead person i'm not a sour person so if you like sour watermelon warheads this might be for you but it's not really for me so exciting still love the authentic collab i'm still gonna finish it but you won't catch me drinking a ton of these in any case guys i wanted to jump on you real quick throw this together if you guys give you my authentic review and feedback i obviously am biased because not only do we have a business affiliate relationship with ghost i've been friends with dan for quite some time um play call of duty with him and ryan pretty often uh there's no uh hiding from the fact that i do support their company very heavily i think they do great things for the industry i think that these authentic collaborations that's really carbonated by the way these are really heavily carbonated i'm just a big fan of what they do to legitimize our industry to elevate it and bring other brands and industries into this one just like this bringing candy into supplements uh we are biased but i think i'm

welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "z_Kugrnbiao": "hello everyone and welcome to week's the review show where we review marijuana edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary you guys might be wondering why I've got this Nutella in front of me and that is not because I've switched over to reviewing non marijuana edibles that's just because I'm taking this as a vessel for fat because I'm looking at another gummy today I'm looking at the cushy punch TKO 200 milligram lime flavored gummy edible I don't know if you can see it that package is a little shiny so it might not show up on the camera there on the back we've got some nutrition information oh and guys real quick as well this is one of our week's minis where instead of our customary 30 60 and 120 minutes I just come out to you the initial time and after 2 hours to let you know how we're feeling so first things first when it comes to gummies I always like to have a little fat first and I like to have a little fat I like to have a little Intelli so I'm just gonna take a nice little lick I wish delicious Nutella yum yum and now that I've got some fats in my body I feel more comfortable with taking this and this is a surprisingly potent edible this is so small and they proclaim it's 200 milligrams I've never been a fan of gummy edibles I don't think they've ever been as effective oops but I do think they are more effective when you are when they are consumed with us so here we go here is what the edible the looks like right there we'll try to open this up oh wow it is very plain-looking it is just like a green shot of jello smells a lot like marijuana smells a hell of a lot like weed probably even opening this up you'd get caught because it smells so much like weed a little difficult to get out and there we have it for tiny little squares and apparently this is 200 milligrams THC I say we shall see here we go down the hatch all at once oh oh that is bad oh it tastes they say lime it tastes just like marijuana except in a gummy version and that flavor is sticking around oh that is vile yeah let me do a little bit more fats Thank You mysterious camera person mm okay that's better you get that nasty taste in my mouth I hope it's going to be worth the anguish because this is a 200 milligram edible they say it's won some kind of award and the bud tender recommended it very highly and for something so small it was quite expensive at ten dollars so I mean I've got high hopes even though it isn't gumming I will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know if those high hopes are validated or not thank you so much for watching we'll see you soon it's been a bit of 90 minutes welcome back to wheats I know I said I'd check back in about two hours but it's only been about 90 minutes and the reason I'm here early is because the experience sort of already peaked and is fading I'm actually kind of already pretty much done sober which is unfortunate men what a colossal disappointment the cushy punch TKO is it's expensive it tastes like [ __ ] and it doesn't get you high at all that is three strikes and you are out uh cushy punch TK arrow more like a big cushy punch TK no thank you hard pass woof-woof-woof if you see the sound of dispensary near you just a boy and I'll cost grab anything else this is gonna do nothing for you except thin your wallet well that's thank you so much for watching wheats sorry that we had a disappointment on this review but hopefully we've got better product around the corner thank you so much for watching okay catch you guys next time", "xdRDyFmr6lw": "[Music] what up what up it's garage gym homie and

review supplement reviews gizmos gadgets goodies all sorts of good finds for you fine folks out there so click subscribe and let's get into this alpha lion freaking love this company i've reviewed their cheetah burn i reviewed their alpha shredder i reviewed their sleep formula i don't know what else i know that at least three oh they're freaking komodo pump one of my favorite maybe my favorite non-stem it's now uh i haven't tried it since they uh change the label maybe reformulate it i gotta check um but that's like my favorite non-stim so this company is freaking they make hitters after hitters after hitters after freaking hitters let's freaking go i'm stimmed up let's go quit monkeying around and let's get into this superhuman supreme they have a super human pre-workout so this is their higher stem um when i when i started learning about these pre-workouts tj fitness deal news told me he's like this one he gave me a list of three pre-workouts superhuman supreme hyper max and freaking pre-phase ko told me were must-haves so i got all three of them so this one let's talk about the freaking facts you know why i freaking like alpha lion they don't freaking put feelings on the freaking bottle you can't freaking print feelings you put facts on the bottle this isn't freaking fox news msnbc cnn or whatever the heck you're watching at home straight up fitness talk with garage jim homie and here we talk freaking facts let's get down to business one scoop 17 grams put that boy on the scale so you get servings per container 21. that's an interesting number i think that's uh an alpha lion thing 21 servings so whatever if this product is as quality as uh you know it's hyped up to me i'm going to talk about if it is or isn't then 21 servings is fine with me i'm not nitpicky about it because i'm not going to use it that often anyway when something's so freaking good i can't overuse it so this is going to last me you know if i use this once a week at the most about if i'm not a supplement reviewer and i only have a few pre-workouts i'm i'm not using this more than really once a week if this is their higher stem whatever i'm not going to use this daily so you know you got some nia and i don't i like that they don't do the freaking one scoop two scoop they freaking got right down to business you take one scoop 17 grams end of freaking story here we go niacin 12.5 milligrams vitamin b12 sodium whatever so then you got your super human energy and focus matrix so you got freaking caffeine anhydrous 300 milligrams that's a freaking solid amount then you've got the juniper berry extract 200 milligram some people say it's a bs some people say it's a good stem that pairs well with the caffeine um gives you a good mood elevation adds to the energy i know redcon1 uses it like their total war and whatever then you've got the orionis extract 200 milligrams that's the end dimethyl whatever the heck it is uh that's a good freaking stimulant that pairs well with the caffeine gives you a good mood elevation gives you a good after effect when you're in the gym clown around with your homies you're gonna be talking junk you're gonna tell them how small their muscles look you're talking about you know your freaking failed uh experiences with women it's gonna be great infinergy dye caffeine malate 75 caffeine so you get 100 milligrams of that 75 percent of that 75 milligrams added to the freaking 300 milligrams of caffeine you get a total of 375 milligrams of caffeine i'm like a freaking mathematician oh my god um so then that die caffeine malate they use the trademark in finergy that's the uh it's a slower release caffeine so after the workout it's going to hold you through the workout after the workout you're going to still feel like you're on freaking legend status hopefully n methyl triamine hci 75 milligrams don't really know what the heck that does but it's part of their energy and focus matrix i'm not freaking bill nye the science guy get over it here to talk about practical experience end of story all right then you got the superhuman pump and performance matrix citrulline melee two to one ma ratio seven grams that's a solid uh freaking amount of citrulline that's gonna give you the pumps the gorilla look uh the vascularity it's gonna get you freaking looking like a god in the freaking gym when you're hitting them dang weights l-touring uh one one gram then they throw in the s7 100 milligrams that's like a whole blend of uh stuff i don't know people say it's good some people say it's not it's like a hydration thing superhuman strength matrix beta so you got 3.5 uh grams that's a freaking nice dose of beta that's gonna give you the warm fuzzy hug the tingles the revved up feeling endurance let's freaking go 18 anhydrous we call that the all-arounder 2.5 it's going to help with power output strength it does a lot of stuff out the inning 150 milligrams that's their anti-crash course matrix so what's that going to do is kind of make sure that you don't have a crash from the stimulants i don't know man freaking i used to be in my head about althea ugh i don't like galthini the review bros kind of put me up on game they said el theanine we really like it so i'm trying to re-evaluate how i feel about l-theanine maybe it's in my head that i don't like it uh really it probably doesn't do anything negative maybe it even helps um so i don't really know then you got the absorption matrix so they give you estrogen and bioprinting so 17 grams loaded scoop they're not clowning around here uh and they give us the dosage of everything so we like that and they got a bunch of trademark names which you know obviously don't mean anything but let's talk about the experience well i have about a third left to this boy is this thing good is this worth the hype yes it's freaking worth the hype this thing is freaking awesome probably my freaking top favorites pre-workouts of all time definitely like a

ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated

let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "cCzulqCnNtY": "[Music] we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are reviewing probably for the last time because they've disappointed me so many times nother bar this time they're salted all chocolate as you can see here it cost me 12 bucks at my dispensary although I believe I got a discount for 10 is it 200 milligram edible and if it really were as potent as advertised or merely cody has advertised it would be a good deal I reviewed two nutbars in the past on the boat pretty disappointing to be honest so I don't have a lot of expectations for this one I reviewed a 100 and a 200 milligram in the past and found them both to be lacking in the potency department but but pretty good in the flavor so let's go ahead and note but be salted almond one chocolate here and give it a taste I believe I picked this up at cool calm collective and Huntington Beach Orange County so here we go we've got our packaging here this fancy gold foil we've got a little bit melted somewhere along the way but you can see what it looks like they're little nutbar symbols get a bite you can see the salted almonds on the back it's okay mmm very sweet chocolate very sweet did you like almonds you're gonna like it better than okay it's good chocolate take a second place we just did let you hmm not that low liking the chocolate yet again but how am I gonna like how it makes me feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'll come back to you guys in two hours let you know our feline thanks for watching weeks two hours later alright guys it's been two hours I've got to admit that this is the best of the nug bars that I've had so far I am definitely the most high from this one which is curious that I'm certainly more high from this one that I alright perceive myself as being more high from this one than the other two hundred milligram when I had not a whole lot more but but noticeably to me so there might just be some batch issues I'm not sure there but I would say the last time I was that maybe a you know three something like that and it's what I felt no rocking about a five so you know there's you know definitely something they're still not my go-to not gonna be my first thing I like the taste of it this actually grew on me quite a bit as I ate it I like the dark chocolate I have like all of theirs in terms of taste and this one ended up being a pleasant surprise in terms of I was expecting nothing from it and a nice little high so I got to give it to nug bar on this one they they they earned some kudos so as mild as praise is that that as I have given it I'm not sure if you can call that kudos or not but you know whatever thank you so much for watching wheats guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if

to another video man we're back filming back on my phone instead of the iPad my iPad is kind of [ __ ] out right now so it's whatever I can stick with the phone I like it a little bit better anyway west of the hassle so today's video guys I got a edible review my favorite edible it's the flavor X watermelon sour belt well they're not called sour belt but it's just built this is the packaging I would show you that apples inside and everything but I kind of ate it all and I'm just going to give you my experience and my review and should you get it get should you even you know try it out but before we start off the video man I do have a bowl loaded so I got some alien OGE loaded up we're gonna be using my big bong cuz the bubblers dirty and plus I keep knocking it over [ __ ] annoying but this is the only no G already took a bat rip and I put some fresh stuff on top but hopefully you guys are gonna be smoking along with me I was going to get hit on my babe but not today man so anyhow guys hopefully you're having a good day and yeah let's get this video started with uh take this first hit and hopefully you guys are smoking along with me if so let me know what you're smoking on cuz I'm always curious to know what you guys are smoking on um while watching the video and let's get dis sesh started man so Cheers so yeah guys so today we're gonna be reviewing the flavor X watermelon belt this is a 250 milligram package it contains with 10 belts each belt is 25 milligrams each and to tell you the truth it had really good taste really sweet it was a bit sour at times but one of the better gummies that I've tried and the California cannabis market like there but yeah man [ __ ] almost aired out here for a second but flavor axe is a San Diego company and I do live in San Diego so it's pretty cool hometown company at least that's what I was told Dendi the research but I know they do have a production factory down um down in San Diego though so you know I don't I don't know if they started up in San Diego that they do you have a factory here um and yeah guys like honestly best best tasting gummies didn't taste like cannabis at all like super sweet but it tastes exactly like watermelons didn't taste anything else I didn't get any weed back taste to it or anything like that um I I had to like the downfall though but like the downfall to it I had to eat a half a bag to really feel something but my tolerance is pretty high cuz I do smoke every day and I do eat edibles on more than a couple of times a week so I do have a pretty high tolerance so um if you're like a rookie like looking in on this like don't eat have the don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know cuz you'll be [ __ ] throwing up and you're gonna be regretting it and you wouldn't like edibles at all like you want in try it and try one again after experiencing a edible overdose it's really shitty it's happened to my mom a couple of times funny enough but uh but yeah I don't don't be that a don't be that a smart guy that chased you uh eat half the bag or the whole bag and just think oh don't feel anything okay do not do not be a [ __ ] like that man that's all I got to say but yeah man like I really do recommend this product this is like a really shorter like video I guess not really but yeah like I read into everything like this time around I read the packaging there they are lab tested and they do follow the new guidelines for the edibles if you're an outsider that's not in California if you don't know what I'm talking about back last month June not July 10th or July 1st they passed a new law which is like the new phase going into the recreational and medical market for the cannabis market here in California everything has to be free packaged everything has to be lab tested and yeah there it's much stricter like compared to like Oregon like I see origin like they so have like they're so using the pill bottles now it's in fanciest jars and they give you in the legal dispensaries anyhow they give you a smelly proof bag and everything and it's child locked it's to prevent kids from it's to prevent [ __ ] the kids getting into the [ __ ] my cat [ __ ] tried to pop in the video popped in the video again so sorry about that but a dude come on this she's a dick anyhow yeah so it's really different here I've been kind of looking into like other states and stuff not really finding anything but just like comparing but it really does seem like California's a lot stricter with the whole marijuana thing compared to everywhere where else but yeah man honestly I'm gonna have to give the edibles a 5 out of 5 I'm sorry for kind of rambling on about the whole California cannabis market but I just to give you guys insight of like what's different and hopefully you guys learned something new about it if you're you were interested in knowing how the market was here but five out of five I would get them again and it was only 20 bucks - I did not mention that I only paid twenty [ __ ] bucks for this and hell yeah I would pay for it again cuz it's cheap I don't mind paying twenty bucks or something that gets me [ __ ] up like I'm pretty sure if I take like a month off like tolerance break man and and I eat least like I'm pretty sure like a half half a belt would get me pretty ripped but I do have a high tolerance and I don't know when the next time I'm going to be taking a tolerance break to be honest but but yeah guys I'm going to take one more rip and be out of the way the next video is going to be string review of alien og I might have that out later today or probably tomorrow which is I'm recording this video on Friday the 24th so the 25th tomorrow you'll get the video and if you have it already man make sure to click on the post

truffles with the most delicious whipped dark chocolate ganache filling they're so good oh my gosh they're only available for a limited time and we do ship internationally so if you would like a box definitely check out the link in the description box down below hello everybody welcome back so as you may see I have a little guest here today that enthusiam camera and so today we are making some gummy bears for dogs and this is part of my little Paddington's pantry series because this if you look at the camera is Paddington my Pomeranian and every so often at me makes and dog friendly treats so today we are making some coming ears and I didn't know that dogs could eat gelatin for the longest time and once I heard that that was possible I'm like oh my gosh this needs to happen for you too so we are making a lot of element gummy bears today but actually not bears they are a little like bone shape how cute is this mold I'll have them will link in the description box if you would like to check it out and before we get started I'll someone let you guys know that I have a member the only exclusive Facebook group that'll give you guys access or will allow you guys fix - um actually dictate what videos I film and give you guys a lot of creative control over this channel and over my chocolate shop on Etsy so if you wanna learn more about that I'll have that link in the description box below but without further ado let's get started and look at me bears and also in that group you'll get like behind-the-scenes photos and videos of Paddington's okay let's get started so first what you want to do is place two cups of fresh watermelon in a food processor and pulse until smooth show you to remove any pulp and then measure one cup of watermelon juice and so I'm using waggling in this video just because it's safe for dogs and it's like a nice kind of flavor for gummy bears that I recommend be using fresh fruit and it kind of this way versus using store-bought juice just because there's a lot of additives in store-bought juice like for humans and you don't necessarily know if there's an ingredient in there that could harm your dog there's a sweetener called xylitol off it on the screen here and that is so toxic three dogs so you definitely want to avoid anything with that and any kind of artificial sweetener so just to be safe I'd stick with fresh fruits or dogs safe beef broth beef broth I've purchased um beef broth powder from the pet store and it's safe for dogs there's no onion or garlic in it which is also toxic to dogs so before you decide to make experi dogs just do a quick Google and make sure that the ingredient that you're using like for the juice is animal friendly or dog friendly um one thing to really stay away from is any kind of juice that contains grapes or grape juice obviously those are so toxic for dogs oh my gosh so definitely stay away from that but I just recommend like call your vet or do a quick google before but watermelon is safe and paddington like I was sitting on the couch the other night and I was eating watermelon and he saw me and literally like dough onto me because he wanted it so badly so and you want to kill some gelatin into some water and microwave for 15 to 30 seconds or until it's liquid and it regards to the gelatin there's a lot of chatting in this video but you want to make sure that you that you're using a Knox gelatin which is plain unflavored unsweetened gelatin and don't use jell-o that like the job of box dip powder um that's because there are artificial sweeteners in that too and those aren't safe for your dog so just to be safe I'd recommend using thin box gelatin and I'll have that linked in the description box below and Amazon if you want to pick them up they want to pour the liquid gelatin into the watermelon juice and mix well or they make sure enjoyed gummy bear or Minnie bone mold and but into the fridge until it's set for about one to two hours let's unmold feed them to your puppy and are done that is so if it guys so much for watching these yummy should be stored in the fridge will probably last you around like four or five days just because

make sure you hit that button sunday we're going to do our 420 giveaway our big giveaway so make sure you subscribe for that make sure you're on the video on sunday whatever else i put with it but it will be the giveaway uh leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you guys are smoking on i got lucky and picked up a little member berry today you guys know i love that [ __ ] all right i forgot to grab one thing give me one second all right it's in this box here so just give me a second all right so i was perusing on a line the other day um looking for some stuff on instagram let me toss that back in there i've been looking for uh marbles what they call them you guys know i got this terp slurper off a waist for like four bucks uh and they usually cap them with a little marble and then they stick a like it looks like a pill in here like called whatever they call it and then some smaller balls in there you can do that well like i said of that 60 bucks i spent five i'm not even sure if i like a tarp slurper yet so i've been trying to find a cheap one i run right across the uh stone back glass stone bat glass he's out of ohio um and he had some marbles on there let's get this open and see if i can find a knife and i dm and him and ask him you know what price he had on one um you know he sent back some questions and i said i just want something cheap i just got a turf slurper i want to try it and he gave me an incredible price on them could not pass it up so i was like what else do you got but like i said he's a medical i believe medical patient in ohio he does have two kids around two years old age so he's talking for a little bit um but he's got some nice glass i think there's something there shouldn't be that many oh yeah i think i got three marbles okay so i will put a link for him down in the description he does have an ecstasy store or este whatever you want to call it so this is going to be one of the little balls here and like so as soon as we get done with this we'll do the review of the other stuff um but these are the ones he had laying around that he didn't uh they didn't come out quite so good i think they look great oh it looked like there was a hole in it it's not it's just a spot now he said he he polishes them a little bit but they might be a little dusty um he uses like a wet polish but i mean look at that's a nice looking little marble there and that's not even the best looking one i don't know what that is and i guess all i thought there was only two marbles looks like two marbles and something extra there now this is the one that i just thought was beautiful like a swirling planet or something it's got some mainly blues in there but it's a little darker on that side so that's what like a little tint of yellow and orange in there in certain spots but just nice let's see which one of these fits are slurper haha see just like that so the smaller one fit the big one fits too but the smaller one fits a little better so i have to ask him what size that was so now we got a thing for our banger this looks like it's a pendant and i didn't order a pendant so he must have threw that in there as a bonus let's see what this is oh yeah check that out nice little pendy some glue back there it's like blue and green that's nice all right i think this one's my favorite one now he does have another one i won't tell you how much i paid for the balls because he asked me not to um but that was after i didn't tell him i was doing a video until afterwards after everything was said and done the payment was finalized and everything then i told him i was going to do a youtube review on the stuff and he said don't mention the price of those because it was a good price now this is gray it does have like a greenish tint to it but this was like 22 bucks guys he has another one that's more blue and it's more blue and purple up here and he said he's had it for a while too i've seen it on his instagram today he said he'd take us less for it also but look at that 22 bucks for a hand blown he blows us in his garage he's been he's been blown glass oh and it sits i wasn't sure it was going to sit up but it's got that little leg right here on the side little foot which lets it sit up now the carbs on the wrong side for me i preferred on that side but that one this wasn't a custom-made piece this was something he had laying around that's why i got him as cheap as i did now if you ask for something custom it's probably going to be a little bit higher but like i said i was like what else you have laying around that you can throw in the box tonight with that stuff and this is the stuff he had laying around but like i was saying he um i believe he's been blowing glass for a year now um he just started doing it on his own three months ago i'm not sure if he lost his job because of the covet or if it's just a move he decided to make oh nice now this thing he let go for eight dollars guys again we got some green glass a little swirl of orange here on the end and i couldn't believe that for eight bucks so i was super super stoked about this you know i like my dry pipes yeah nice the glass isn't real super thin and like i said this is blown by a guy right here in or not right not in florida but you know middleton ohio wherever it was ohio it's a little bit further up north i think in ohio but if you're looking for you want a hand blown piece of glass that's not everybody else is going to have reasonably priced like i said he's not doing big fancy stuff yet give him time i'm looking at this stuff i'm thinking he won't be far before he gets there um but if you want something reasonably priced that looks good it functions hit him up um i know on his ssc story has a lot of pendants but he does have pipes and other stuff like that you can hit him up in a dm on instagram or something like that ask him to send you pictures of what he's got or give him an idea what you want i love that little thing i've been wanting a little sherlock for a while i've got a few other ones i really just don't care for and like i said threw in a a free pendant when that stuff was already super super super cheap it was so cheap that i threw an extra five dollars in to help cover for shipping because i almost felt like i was robbing the dude um like i said these two alone that was 30 bucks by itself these two 22 and 8 30 bucks you cannot beat that right there so like i said i'll leave the links down there in the description for him you're not only supporting a small glass blower but you're helping a father support his kids so keep that in mind if there's something you've been looking for give him a holler or if you're just like me you just like to collect stuff give him a holler like i said he's got another blue one almost identical to this one except for his blue here and more purple with the multi colors up here as i'd say this is blue and orange or white orange probably probably the dominant colors in that the other one looked like it had more purple where the orange was that was more dominant color but still sexy looking when it was real close for me to pick between the two of them it's hard for me not to get both of them to be honest all right so like i said i will leave links the first ones that jump on and see it give me a minute to put the links up i'll put a link for the essence store and i'll try to put a link for his instagram on there too um so we got some gummies today from true leave we will talk about the ones we got from cure leaf we still have some of them we haven't messed with them too much now you see they're in a ziploc baggie i did that so these wouldn't dry out but i'll show you that didn't help much they'd dried out they're kind of crusty they're not that old yet you can see where it's turning real white that's where they're getting kind of hard and crusty um these like i said had a a real bad syrupy kind of taste to them the flavor wasn't bad but the aftertaste in the back of your throat was like you drunk had a bunch of pancakes with syrup but the flavor wasn't bad now let's move on to the ones you guys are looking for and that's the ones from true leave i was able to pick up two of these today or i got guava passion fruit that was the only flavor they had it's the one they come out with today now these are 100 milligram package but you're gonna get two packs with five gummies a piece i opened this you know it's a long car ride home it's like five minutes from truly um these are nice they're a lot softer another thing with cure leaves they was one of those gummies that was real hard to chew so these are only five milligrams true leaves are ten so i'm thinking i'm somewhere around 50 milligrams i would have to eat two of these i tried six one day and my jaw was sore from cueing so much these i would only have to eat five and i don't see my jaw hurting they're more of a softer gummy um to where these are more like eating a steak you know what i mean you have to chew on them for a second the flavor on true leaves there there's no aftertaste on these so one night i thought i had some you know like a fake sugar aftertaste like a sweet and low or something now i haven't experienced that with these but i've only ate three of them so far i ate two on the way home and i ate another one a little bit ago it's got more of like a pineapple like the tart lemon they're a little bit more sour strong flavor not so much on the smell like when you open these you can smell them and it had pretty much a mild flavor these you can't smell when you bite into them the flavor just kind of explodes in your mouth i really like these i even thought i felt something just from the two right off the bat almost which was kind of weird now you will adult i don't want to get too far into this you will need to get an edible recommendation from your doctor here in florida to get the edibles so don't forget that some doctors you can just call up and get it with nothing at it i heard a couple other people said their doctor charged them 20 bucks so it's just going to depend on your doctor you have to call them find out but i wouldn't wait too long i would try to get on there and get that done that way if something does come out that you would like to try it doesn't run out while you're waiting on your doctor to get your recommendation in there and then you have to wait another two or three months for it to come back out again so keep that in mind but i was impressed enough with these and like i said there was no they didn't say there was a limit they said i get as many as i want it so i got two of them uh i'm gonna go back right now and if they're not out i'm getting two more so i was pretty impressed with these i'm gonna do um a whole pack here after i get back so that'll be 50 milligrams which is nice they've got and i guess that's the universal sticker there was nothing actually on the gummy take that out and show you but see it's real soft it's still got some density too but when you bite into it it kind of you know it's one of them softer ones about the only way i can explain it it does have just a little bit of sugar coating on the outside i think or something but not much yeah i guess there is a little bitty you can't even hardly see it there's a little bitty stamp like a diamond i'm guessing that's going to be the same as that one so um now i know the website said it's select locations my location wasn't one of the select locations that was listed but i went and they had them because when that first popped up it said every location but the ones it excluded the ones that was on there the first time two days ago and then it popped back up saying only those locations but like i said mine had them so they're not showing up on the website you just have to bite the bullet go in there i waited 30 minutes got in and out i think i got there like 10 40 10 50 this morning i was out at 11 20. so we'll see when i go back if it's any longer i'll post on instagram if i had a long wait or anything so you catch me over there i'm going to upload this one finish smoking this and go back and see if i can get some more so like i said guys if you've been looking for some new pipes i definitely say check out the stone bat stone back glass um real reasonable price uh and nice looking stuff i can't i don't see anything to complain about you know like i said for a 22 sherlock i don't see nothing wrong the hole is not off center it's not gigantic um i see no chips no breaks in the glass no air bubbles i mean there's air bubbles in that of course but you know what i mean not a bunch of air bubbles in the glass no stress on the joints or anything like that where it's bent so yeah i like it same thing with this it's simple it's elegant it doesn't have a lot of crap coming off of it the hole is pretty much centered um that's pretty yeah i'd say that's pretty much [ __ ] perfectly centered um it's not super huge so he didn't screw up the holes or anything like that neither one of the sides not super huge there's no rough edges the mouthpiece is nice and big so i'm pretty impressed especially for the price like i said eight dollars man and you know who blew the glass so go check him out i'll leave the links down there hopefully you guys have an amazing weekend i'm going to try to do the g-pin connect tomorrow for a saturday and we're going to do the giveaway on sunday so if everything goes at plan check back tomorrow for g pin giveaway on sunday and then hard time what we'll do by monday so hopefully everybody's smoking on something good and as always keep on toking my friends till next time", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "I8poFBA1blw": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test review featuring special guest jazzasaurus and today's product the moonwalker watermelon skittles vegan gummy we've already honestly eaten a couple of these we couldn't wait we met the guys they gave us some we had to try them right away they're good so we knew that we had to share here in the taste test series we're gonna let jazzy kind of dive right into the what's on the box and the information and kind of share some of that good stuff and then we'll dive right in we ate a bunch we ate a lot of them we know that they're good but we had to share so they're called atlas watermelon skittles 25 milligram gummies and i'm going to read what it has inside it's 15 calories 2 grams of sugar and everything else is zero hemp extract 25 milligrams sugar corn syrup pectin sunflower oil water flavoring sodium citrate sodium acid sulfate citric acid natural and artificial food coloring 25 milligrams delta eight thc and plant derived terpenes take one gummy every six hours or as desired they had the test results on the bottle you can scan which is super cool it does say one gummy packed in right uh 15 calories nothing too crazy i mean i personally think you're freaking delicious it tastes like a slightly less sweet less sour watermelon gummy like the watermelon candies from sour patch cakes it's not sour it's just delicious it's so good and it it would really be hard for me to just eat one yeah there's three left in this whole thing 25 pieces started in the bottle uh we gave out probably two to each of our friends over the last you know seven to ten days and you know we've eaten a couple effect wise have you noticed any effect for that you've experienced in this i do feel like at night i'm much more chill i'm sleeping better i'm going into a deeper sleep my mood is better um just more relaxed yeah i would say just a little bit more calm less anxious overall for me personally this sounds like something similar for you so that's dope and the flavor wise this is a taste test review what is your score for the flavor of this gummy i don't taste chemicals or anything i don't like fake yeah it doesn't taste like i mean i know it's watermelon flavor but i enjoy it it's really good yeah they went with some solid flavoring mm-hmm for what for uh for like the creation and crafting of this product i'm coming in at a nine uh 9.25 on the flavor uh and the overall score on this product for me is going to be a 93 out of 100. so for me it's um nine out of ten nine out of ten for both overall in flavor yeah um i was trying to think of why but no i like the packaging i do enjoy like this this is like a medical you know it's like a gummy vibe you know like the the uh your vitamin vibe right but the packaging makes it seem cooler than a the information how it's presented i think is super dope so mad respect to moonwalker great work you guys um let us know if you guys have any questions in the comments any requests anything you want to know we'll slide in the moonwalker

Now you can choose a sour candy from the Mystery Bag of Doom. - Okay, got it. - I guess we'll have to make\nthis go away, so here we go. You ready? Oh, snap. So, Devan, now let's see\nwhat sour candy you got. - Oh! - It's like a clump of gummy worms. Yo, so wait, are you just\ngonna take a bite of that? - Yeah, I mean, I think\nI have to at this point. - Well, save some though\nbecause we need to use this for the giant gummy bear\nthat we're making, so. - All right. - So I guess, put a little bit in here. - Dude, you're just\nslamming everything around. - And, here we go. And take your bite, Devan. - All right, here we go. Oh, oh, dude, whoa. - Make sure you stick around\nbecause we will be making the largest giant sour gummy\nbear in the entire world, but right now, you're onto the next round. He's gone. Where did he go? - All right, Collins, close your eyes. - Okay. - This is the next item. - What is that? It sounds like it's gonna chip my tooth. - Oh, it might. - Let's see if I can get some flavor. - All right, go for it. - Oh, what is that? - Let me see this. - What is this, bro? - Wait, can you guess it? I mean, it should be pretty\nobvious by now, right? - I think it's a cucumber soda, which is the weirdest thing. - Dude, you got it! - So, we got the Bag of Doom back, Devan. Choose your next sour candy. - No, oh, it's sticky. It's got ants in it. - That reminds me of the\nliquid glass that we made. - Oh, no. - But it has ants in it. (laughing) - Oh, really? - Dude, if the ants just wanna crawl away on the table, that\nwould be so freaky. - No, don't even say it. - But you got it now, Devan. Take a lick of it. - Dude, is this even sour? - Yes. Yeah, look at it, it's got the malic acid looks like on there. - Oh, no, you're right, it does. Three, two, one. - You're gonna chip a tooth. - Ow, that hurt so bad. All right, oh, oh. - Are you good? - No, dude, what do you\nthink, it's malic acid. - Bam! - Look inside of this. - Dude, you cracked like on an ant. All right, guys, so Devan and I, we're gonna do the\nlargest gummy bear ever. We'll be doing at the end, but right now, we are on to the next round. All right, Devan, close your eyes. - All right. - And here is the next crazy, weird, food. Check this out. - Oh no. - Wait a second. That is not what was supposed to be there. There's only way to fix\nit. It's called Yeet-Za. (laughing) - Oh, dude! - Yeet-Za is not for everyone. - Oh, man. - Let's just see if it worked. Boom, there we go. That's more like it. Devan, I'm so sorry. - Dude, can I just win this\nround automatically for that. - You literally, hold\nup, hold, up, hold up, on your forehead. - What? - Nothing, you look great. Here we go and remember, a\nsour candy is on the line. - It's a pizza. It's like a Pringle and it's a pizza. - How did you get that right so quickly? - Dude, you said Yeet-Za. - I'm gonna go with the claw, you ready? Move this off to the side that way. - No, no, no. - I don't wanna do this. These are gonna be terrible. This is, hang on, sour pink lemon. Feel likes a pink lemon. - It's a grapefruit, bro. That does exist. - Here we go. Three, two, one. - No, you can't pull\nthat all the time, dude. You gotta eat it, bro. - Okay, fine, okay, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one. - Yeah, oh finally. How's it taste, Collin? Really good? Really good? All right, well, maybe try another one. Maybe it'll help. All right, onto the next one. What, I don't, what are you saying? I already said onto the next one. - The bowl! - The what? - The bowl! - Oh, got it. - All right, next round, let's go. - Collins, close your eyes. And this is the next item. Whoa! All right, ready? - Yeah. - Three, two, one. It's not that bad. - It's all like hairy and fluffy. - Any guesses? - This is not good - I feel like this would\nactually be pretty good. Really? - Oh my god. - Well, do you have any guesses? - Oh, it's got a sweet and kinda salty... Oh, oh, bacon! It's Bacon Cotton Candy! - No, how did you get that? - Yahoo! - Dude, how did you get that? - Sorry, what did you say? - How did you get that? - Sorry, one more time. I can't hear you. - How did you get that? - Sorry, what did you say? - What, bro, how did you do that? (Collin mumbling) - This one's really cool. - Dude, what? How did you do that? - Magic! Damn, Devan gotta choose\none of the Bag of Doom! - All right, fine. This one! Whoa, it feels really light. What's inside? I don't know. Oh, wait, what? - What? - Yo, they sound like\nthey're little maracas. - No! - Yes, I've never seen a sour\ncandy like this before ever. - Three, two, one. - But first, 5 Second Subscribe Challenge.

No, no. - Worms! - Wow. - The little bottles of soda. This looks super duper sour. Here we go, three, two, one. - Are they delicious? Do you want some more? No, are you sure? - So, for this one, I'm gonna need to prepare it a little bit, and to do that, I gotta heat things up,\nyou know what I mean? Oopsie. Devan, stay right where you are. - What is going on? - Nothing is happening. All right, step one, done. - This is one item, right? - Oh, yes, for sure. Gonna pop this over here. - Oh, gotta sneeze. - And then a finishing touch. (Devan sneezes) - Bless you. - Oh, thanks. - Now, it's time to roast it! Wow, so cool. - It sounds like you're\nmaking a fool of yourself. Just sounds like it. - What? Stick out your tongue. - Okay. - Guess it. What do you think it is? - Like a graham cracker or something. - So we're gonna feed this to you the way it's intended\nto be eated, you ready? - Eated? - All right, Devan, open up your mouth. Three, two, one, bite down. One more thing, open up your mouth. What is the original item that this is? - Goldfish? - How did you guess that? - Cause of the shape. - Yes, you got it. It's Goldfish S'mores. Ah, man, I can't believe you guessed it. Oh, yeah, these are... - These are not good. - These are rough. Three, two, one. - I remember these. I think I tried these. We're grabbing the bucket, bro. Are you good, no? (Collins mumbles) All right, onto the next one. What? All right, cool. I hope you feel better. All right, Collins, your eyes are closed. - My eyes are closed. - As they can see. This is the next item. All I can say is good luck, Collins. I'm very glad I'm not doing this one. I'm just gonna toss them in there. All right, here we go, Collins. Three, two, one. - Wait, wait, wait! First, let's do a 3 Second Like Challenge! I want to see if you can like\nthis video in three seconds. Ready, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one, done. - All right. - Three, two, one. I missed some. - It's a little bit spiky, a little bit. - Any guesses so far? Dude, you dropped one. - Chocolate covered, I don't\nknow, scorpions or something? - What? Chocolate covered insects, bro. - No, god. - We've got crickets. We've got worms, bro. - It stuck to my tongue at one point. I was trying to get it off my tongue. - You sound like a goose. - That was horrible. I can't believe I have to\nhave another disgusting thing after I just ate bugs. These actually, if they weren't sour, I'd probably really enjoy them cause they're like Life Savers all much. - All much? - But I. Let's see how these taste. - All right, there we go. - One, two. - Oh, yeah, has it hit yet? Oh, there it is! - Number three is the charm. - Bro, are you good? Wait, did they get better? - Yep. - Nice. - So, this is definitely the weirdest one we've had so far. I am so happy I don't have to eat this. I'm serious. - Weirder than insects? - Oh my gosh. - Three, two, one. - He counts himself down. - It just tastes really\nfizzy and very sweet. - Well, take a bite of this\nand try to mix some flavors together to give you hint of what this is. What is it? - Well, they taste exactly the same, so I'm going to guess that\nit's either bread soda or toast soda. - No, you didn't get it. - What? - It's butter soda. - Butter soda? - With some bread. Instead of butter, I was gonna\nput a little bit of the soda on top of the bread and\nthen try the bread now. - I don't think so. - Dude, try it. - You try it. - It's part of the rules. I can't eat the item that's not my round. - Oh, so good. - Unfortunately, Devan, you\ngotta get another sour one. - I know. I choose you! - Let's see what we got. - Oh, no. Oh, these don't look good. I'm gonna pour a little bit back in. All, right, here we go. Three, two, one. - You went fish lips, bro. Do not spit on me. - Oh, man. - I need to grab the bowl. - Okay. - Don't spit on me. - I won't. I won't. - Oh, gosh, it got on me.

And here is the next item. - Yay! - Wow, it actually smells\nexactly like what it is. I'm gonna do it, so you can't smell it. Three, two, one. Just bite, just bite, you can't smell it. - I think I know it! - What? Yes? We're all waiting. - It tastes like ketchup. - Yes, dude, you got it! - Dude, right, you know\nwhat would be even better? - What? - Oh, yeah. - What? Oh, dude, what? Where did that come from? Oh, man. - Too much mustard. - All right, I'm going for this bag here. I think you clawed this one. Oh! Oh, snap. - Like sour rope. - And you know, since\nyou lost the challenge, I think you're gonna have to be the one who eats the giant sour gummy bear, bro. - What? No!

bugs and dad today we got something new that I've never really tried I've only tried a little bit but never really got the full length experience but anyway what we're trying today some are [ __ ] edibles but bowel cancer so what we got today I never tried this before I'm using uh-oh so the reason one is so [ __ ] bright right here is because I have a little lamp and that has a connect to it that's why I clamped it onto my tripod and so I'm just using the edge of my camera right here I mean on my desk I'm using the edge of my desk to hold the tripod and I'm just blocking in my room cuz right now it's like 1:30 in the morning I'll get back to y'all in an hour [Music] [Applause] let me do some research on this [ __ ] before I get [ __ ] [ __ ] hey Manny Pacquiao all right guys so now it's 4:00 in the morning and I still don't feel nothing so I'm gonna take a half of another we'll keep y'all updated [ __ ] if anything I still got this bad boy right here but yeah I'm gonna kick back

right now it's 6:00 a.m. been awake all day this is why I never really wanted to try edibles cuz I wouldn't I didn't want to spend money on something that I didn't know was gonna work on me or not because I have read some people there's some weird reason don't don't feel anything so they get no side effects or anything and I'm guessing what I'm one of those people cuz I didn't get any side effects I've I mean I've eat brownies before I know that I do get high off right homey brownies again I ate up around 2:30 it's now 6 a.m. and only how I feel it's from the last joint I just had the high I'm feeling now is from the previous joint I wrote and it's not secret there's another joint that I just wrote this was a review on the edibles I'm gonna read it as 0 today whoa it's rated at 303 just because it did taste pretty good I guess nice pretty big chunky piece of candy it was pretty good has its highs like I could rate it because I thought about getting another pen but I literally

kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "TumG8AXLEGA": "No", "4h8sTpIMn10": "what's up everybody so this is something I want to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "cf9uSYlnJqE": "hey what's going on

like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this

name the names of the flavors are on the little because they come individually wrapped so that each one has a flavor name on there yep so i kind of want to save these for laughs like scooby-doo okay so like whatever you say man [Laughter] so you want to do trolleys first uh yeah we're always disappointed by them because they don't have all the flavors yeah no so let's let's see what flavors they actually have in this one package yep and then if they don't have some of the flavors well then we're crap out of luck and so are you guys because all the easter stuff at our dollar store now is pretty much gone so we would have to order these on amazon to be able to test out the rest and even then it's still a guess on whether or not we're actually going to get the flavors because you know they don't count how many they actually put in so the flavors we have for the trolley sour bite gummy bunnies is we have lemon strawberry cherry lime orange and for some reason the blue is grape doesn't make any sense they could have still made it purple but i guess they're trying to get bright colors and the calories for these uh nine the serving size is nine pieces and it's 100 calories per serving it's 270 per container yes so no was this little is this an activity says color in the bunny's ears and glasses coloring in i guess rainbow i guess oh yeah yeah did you see that it's a blank rabbit there and i guess they want you to color it in rainbow like that that's that's weird i've never seen that before so i'm gonna see what flavors they have in here real quick see they have lemon i believe they have strawberry because the strawberry and cherry kind of look the same but one slightly lighter than the other yeah yeah they have lime they have two orange so that's good and they have grapes which could have just been blue raspberry sour raspberry so they have all the flavors at least yes at least they have all the flavors so the first ones that we're going to try is the lemon ones because i'm pretty sure the lemon the cherry and the lime are going to be the most sour ones yep so uh i really got a paper cut just now on that cardboard cute yeah let me just open this real quick yep i'm good oh wow the fruity aroma is crazy with that yeah it definitely smells like processed sugar and fruit that's for sure so when i say lemon so we're going to order the flavors that is listed so the first one is lemon so we're going to try that real quick and they're cute this one looks like it had his face punched in like someone ripped out the nose and took the bone with it like all right so we'll try that in three two one not too sour no that's actually enjoyable you you have a slight little pucker but it's not you know anything like it's not crazy yeah so let me see if i could differentiate the strawberry from the cherry here it looks like i'm able to yeah okay all right so now we have two strawberry these ones have the nose fully there for some reason i'm getting random sour yeah random about the sour on like random parts of my tongue and it's making me twitch every single time i have one in the back like towards the back of my throat i have one up on the top of my jaw i have one on the left back side of my tongue and on the right front side of my tongue wow everywhere all right anyway so we got strawberry here yep i like strawberry all right there's a good flavor uh profile yeah it's not sour no that one wasn't sour at all now this is cherry which i assume is gonna be sour just because it's cherry cherries bitter so bitter and sour or pretty similar in terms of reaction so for some reason yeah yeah it's actually really light well has a bit of a sour cake afterwards but all right so now we got lime i didn't think that one was too bad no none of them are really sour no no these i actually don't mind so we got lime which could have just been green apple come on now yep that kind of tastes like the way incense smells that was weird yeah and it does pack a little bit of a sour punch a little bit now i didn't get much on mine but i tasted more out of that one than the others oh okay this one we have exactly two orange so that's good yup so we'll try that and see how this one actually has a face on it the face isn't punched in or or randomly rounded i can see the eyes and the nose and the little cheek things anyway oh that one's a little sour mm-hmm orange gummies are always going to be my favorite no matter what i say that so much but yep it's a fact my guy my grape yeah and now this this this is grape everybody grape hmm you know it's kind of kind of messes with your head a little bit it's a nice flavored grape it is a nice flavor grape but it messes with your head because normally you would see grape as purple and you know from eating a purple item that is grape no matter what like it is always grape unless you have like some exotic thing like like eggplant or something like that it's always great but then you make look at that blue yeah it's like you look at it and you're thinking it's gonna be raspberry yeah but you get grape it kind of messes with your brain a little bit yeah it did mess with mine too yeah yeah all right so the next one we're gonna try is sour patch the sour patch kids and we're gonna see how they'll see if there's a few flavors in this one too i don't think they yeah they don't list all this one well let's go by what the colors are supposedly and we'll try to figure out the flavors and the serving size is 12 pieces and it's 110 calories for 12 pieces yup or if you eat the whole box it's 320. yep so here we go and guys if i seem a little bit off from tasting these candies because i ate crabs on the m ms before doing any of these and i shouldn't add that with chocolate before doing this because it's kind of messing with me a little bit this is the red ones yeah they're little bunnies well see here's the thing if you remember what actual sour patch kids look like this is the bunny setting straight up but if you remember what a sour patch kit actually looks like it looks like that did you turn it upside down yes that's what i'm saying it looks like an actual sour patch kid that kind of messed with me a little bit i was like wait i thought they were supposed to be bunnies when i was handed it i was like but literally like from quick view it just looks like a regular sour patch kid but it's literally a rabbit upside down that's crazy because you see the guys yeah yeah exactly yeah that's more all right so this one i'm going to assume is strawberry or something like that strawberry or a cherry it's pink it's reddish pink yeah reddish pink let's do that again all right so these ones i know are going to be sour because these are always really potent i was just about all right let's go and now it's gone i'm not sure doesn't make me salivate like crazy i think that was strawberry orange orange once again my mind was messed up from the positioning oh that one was really sour oh i don't have more showed up neither do i well by the way if if you realize that we're wearing the same alphas we're trying to pile a bunch of videos into one day so we can get more done and have time to actually upload them instead of doing a video a day like we were right and then rushing to do it not making good content yeah i'm assuming green apple yeah i'm going to some green apple too i'm you ready to die mhm nice lime i don't like that flavor ah i think last one yellow which is lemon yeah i can't wait to get this over now we got warheads next i think it's gonna be even worse yeah yellow all right yellow bunny kid thing that one was horrible i need some water you want some water all right we'll be back in a sec guys okay we're back this is like this this the like one of the second times we've gone and gotten a drink in the middle of a video so i got my water so we can cleanse our pallets in between each sour candy i'm not even going to put a lid on that because i'm gonna be constantly picking it up so so this next one is the warheads chewy bunnies i'm not sure how many flavors they have for this one either it's basically like the sour patch so oh yeah good news guys too um we recently bought uh two plug-in chargers and two extra batteries so if it dies we don't have to wait about an hour to upload the video still oh only three flavors oh my god those things are huge they are what oh it felt like something was in there there's no yeah there is yeah it's green apple watermelon and blue raspberry so i already know the green apple and the blue raspberry are going to be really sour this watermelon might be sour too because it's a subtle flavor so they gotta enhance it smell smells nice sorry it does smell nice it smells it smells i smell the watermelon one above all of it so that means that one's going to be the strongest green yeah i guess green blue or pink green look at these these guys are real these things are really sticky too they're cute i like them these bunnies are really detailed i don't know if you guys can tell or not but there we go get a little bit of shadow on there so you guys can see it all right oh that was nothing warheads why you disappoint me i was expecting a big oh you know oh my gosh but they were so thick these are so thick that this you don't even taste the sourness these are some thick boys oh you you're just hit by a car all right all right now we're doing the blue raspberry i think that's what the next one was right yeah green apple blue raspberry yeah i don't know i'm looking at this for it but ready if you sit there and like suck on the outside you get i guess but i'm just getting some i'm used to that instant punch in the face yeah damn my mind mine was a test tube baby jesus look at it it got all kinds of messed up and then this one is what watermelon watermelon watermelon watermelon that one's got a really nice flavor that's a good watermelon well warheads the flavors are impressive but the sourness is disappointing for you to be known for shower candies i mean that's pretty that's that's kind of sad when sour patch kids out did you in sourness like you were the leading war you were like the leading sour candy and now sour patches got you by like a whole entire milestone this is only one thing though maybe they didn't want to like maybe crazy it you know i guess they should have though because it kind of ruins the brand a little bit well i don't know i like them though like i mean yeah they were good but if i'm not making that face then you shouldn't call yourself warheads you should be called soft heads or something anyway water yeah i mean i thought they were pretty good taste wise they had really nice like different you know different flavors yeah yeah it wasn't the same old same old no the flavor the flavors were pretty strong i'm just disappointed on how not sour they were and that's coming from a guy who hates sour did i read the i didn't read the calories i don't know so there are five pieces per serving three servings per per container and 110 calories per serving yes so and now before we forget it on these these are the scooby-doo ones that we're gonna be doing next and there are 30 calories per one pouch and i think there's only one gummy in each one i know oh it's a bunch of little gummies that's weird they're sour strawberries oh sour straws oh okay they're little sour bites yeah if you look if you look at the packaging you can see the little bites in there okay oh okay yeah so we'll try the blue raspberry they got blue raspberry i know they got where the flavors at where the flavors at i just seen them did you rip it off what did we just say earlier it's written on the package this is sour blue raspberry all right i like scooby-doo yeah i hope this doesn't destroy scooby-doo for me oh freaking the plastic was really staticky the smell is strong that's all that smells like bad raspberry though that's like kind of rancid smelling all right i'm only going to eat like two of these just because i don't i don't trust that they're really small they are they look like little ha ha fingers is easter right and they got the little rabbit pellets oh that's that's good oh they're hard and they're not even shower they're good they're like twizzlers a little bit like the texture twizzlers except a little bit harder than twizzlers they're not even sour they actually just taste sugar coated it tastes really good it's a light sugar it is i really like these yeah those aren't bad i have a weird boardwalk aftertaste but why are you dropping stuff [Music] okay so the next ones that we're going to try out are the sour strawberry so you guys let me show you these guys once again little tiny rabbit pellets so it looks like there's those looks like there's four flavors because i'm seeing we got oh watermelon i thought it was cherry so strawberry watermelon blue raspberry and green apple typical salad flavor just any sour candy really yeah scooby dooby doo these are the sour they're just strong and it takes a lot of power to eat them here we go good strawberry flavor at first still only slightly sweet huh i like these yeah they're not bad they're just like oops they're just like little bites like they're not even they're not sour whatsoever this is the kind of candy that you give the kids that you don't want to destroy with sourness i'm not saying they're gonna like it because a lot of kids like that really intense flavor but if i was skin i would love this yeah all right so now we got sour watermelon oh and we have a new sd card too so this one runs out of memory for us recording so much we could just plug in a new one yep ah come on these bags are really difficult they are i use my teeth man you want mine yeah i'll just take out of yours because it's being a pain i should have done that to begin with i mean honestly so sour watermelon yep not sour not sour fake watermelon taste very fake watermelon taste it's not bad but it's not good at the same time hot taste that one's perfumey after a little yeah that one's not my favorite yeah no all right um no on to the last one oh god that tastes like tastes like an avon product yeah yeah so now we got sour apple yeah sour green apple so let's try and open this ah i'm throwing it hey that one actually opened get off me how many do you normally eat you just get two okay yeah that's fine though all right so now we're trying the sour green apple oh that's an instant green apple taste right as soon as i put in my mouth i tasted it now is it going to stay that's the question no bad aftertaste no it's got a weird taste i don't really taste apple i mean i taste apple but after a while it kind of kind of turned into grape like a green grape after a little bit it tastes big it kind of tastes bad yeah it doesn't taste that great all right water stay hydrated folks yes all right so that wasn't too bad yeah yeah that wasn't too bad for the sour patch kids really knocked me out on my feet man yup and i was surprised with the warheads actually yeah so i love the flavor of those though yeah those were pretty good yeah i like how thick they were because i like thick gummies i like to be able to chew it instead of it being really tough like the ones we just tried were i don't like that i like gummies that are chewy something that you can actually sink your teeth into like a nice rare steak so all right so uh yeah if you guys uh like this video make sure you hit the like button so we know you liked it uh

actually go shopping I went trick-or-treating Milky Way's tootsie rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing my milky way to go cocoa for this you'll need a spoon a mug of milk for small milky way's and a microwave unwrap your milky way's and put them into the mug of milk now microwave for 30 seconds at a time [Music] strain each time until the milk is hot and the milky way's are melted still needs more there it's all melted and it smells really good this Milky Way cocoa is out of this world check out the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's not too sticky to handle you can take it out of the bowl and knead with your hand [Music] gummy and yummy and so fun funny and you can still eat it hmm hope you had a killer haul this Halloween with plenty of candy to spare for these candy haul hacks remember to subscribe to jumex TV and to click here for more life hacks for kids with me Jillian [Music]", "0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "cToho9CnfkE": "hey guys shooting another video here again so I keep getting the question from a lot of people it basically will a sour gummy work for this recipe which is you know vodka infused gummy to be honest with you I haven't done it yet so I went out picked up an extra pack here of sour gummy worms it's our neon crawlers whatever you want call them and for this recipe I'm thinking about using some absolute ruby red which is like a red grapefruit vodka figured that'd be a good combination of flavors there so we will see what happens when we do this experiment basically will these things hold up to the vodka or will they just dissolve you know they're made a little bit differently and they have that a crystallized sour sweet sugar on the outside so let's see what happens we'll just get our Tupperware and one pack of our sour brite crawlers I love these things delicious so if you spread them out and they're going to plump up so it may not look like a whole lot right now but once they've soaked I'll probably double triple in size so get them all in there go ahead grab my ruby red come on now one-handed all right some good stuff here so we'll do a little pour just want to cover them to the top a little bit over all right perfect was probably about mmm maybe eight ounces of vodka this was already open so I did not use that whole mount that whole bottle there you know I had to have a couple drinks before but anywho make sure they're settled in as you can see look like they'll hold up pretty good but you never know like I said they are made a little bit different than your regular gummies so this is an experiment for both of us so hopefully they'll turn out good have a big party coming up this weekend gonna make some nice treats for everyone so basically you just want to take your sealed gummy worms bring them over your fridge set mine down real quick get up in your fridge take these bad boys place them in the fridge I'm just going to let them sit to absorb that vodka you know every day or so you can get in there stir them around make sure they're not sticking and they should start plumping up on you and once you see these the level of vodka there go down you just want to top it off just keep them you know topped up that way they don't dry out or anything so we'll come back and check on that in about a day and give it a stir and then after a few days I'll show you the final property everybody we're back here with the follow-up to the sour gummy infused with vodka this was the first time I've ever done them but I've been getting a lot of questions from people on whether or not it would work just because the actual gummies themselves are kind of a different consistency and they have you know that different like sugar coating on them and stuff but as you can see here they turned out pretty well I would say they've grown maybe double size the color on them is definitely a lot lighter you can tell that there's some liquid infused in there but overall it's been a good test I think there's pretty successful I only had to really top it off about one time over the you know last three days they didn't soak up as much as I was expecting but still did pretty good as for a texture and just grab one out of here see that one snapped right in half it's actually pretty soft show you the center there if you could see try and focus seems to be pretty consistently filled you can tell the core is a little bit more green than the rest look it's just dissolving right there in my fingers yeah it's really soft not not really slimy but it is slippery let me taste a little piece and see just how infuse they are whoo Wow oh man they soaked up a lot of vodka has um actually has a really good taste till this one was like a lime or something so you can really taste that but uh it's definitely got a kick and some heat from the vodka so I would say it's a success it is possible to do with the sour gummies whether it be worms or sour gummy bears or whatever but yeah looks good they're easy to make and should make a good addition to the party so thank you for watching if you guys have any questions comments or requests just let me know and hope to see you around my channel and thanks for watching", "KEEzfgA7Sbo": "Oh it's scared because it's just gonna melt okay let me just get some more thumbnails here no

the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "WKDxAHgCcUw": "g'day welcome to todd's kitchen i've made a number of gummy recipes in the past they're all delicious all easy but they're not exactly keto so we can still have our gummy and eater too if you're on a keto diet so join me today as make my version of keto gummies now these keto gummies are ridiculously simple you just need two ingredients or three if you cut the water so the first one bean and this is the most important one for that gummy consistency is gelatine powder now this is what turns normal jello into a gummy consistency so i've got two cups of warm water so i'm going to add about two tablespoons of our gelatine mixture and we're just going to let that gelatin soak up all that water so just now that's all dissolved i'm just gonna give it a quick stir just to combine and now for the flavor i'm going to use some sugar-free jello now this just makes it far easier but if you don't have sugar-free jello just add some flavoring and say a little bit of stevia for sweetness so into our warm water i'm just going to pour in our sugar-free jello and just give it a good stir until it's completely dissolved okay so lastly i've just got a gummy mould now you can find these in most shops so it obviously makes no difference which one to use and just simply going to pour our mixture into each gummy mold [Music] okay so once you've filled up all your gummy moulds

back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little children remember this is a

wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and yeah like always guys please like subscribe all that wonderful [ __ ]", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "2_mDkLjlTCw": "so what is the best snack to eat at the movies say it with me popcorn but gummy bears are close second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy this one i'd love to know what you guys will think what flavor gummy bears do you guys make let me know let me know down below your favorite candy and thank you so much for watching this video like this video if you like this recipe subscribe if you're new and i will see you all in the next video these are so good literally can't stop eating them these are so good guys i can't stop eating them they're delicious and it's just straight protein can't go wrong i", "cvjFAGNQswQ": "has the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside okay they're very firm and albany's are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the tincture what's up guys welcome back today we're going to be doing a little experiment soaking gummy bears in tincture i know i have done this before so if you guys have seen that and i'll post a link for it it didn't work out very well and i think it was because of the gummies that i use i use gummy worms but i use great value like walmart brand and i don't remember what the ingredients were but i don't know i just i can't stop thinking about it i'm like i want to retry this and do it the right way so i got four different types of gummies or three different types of diet berries and then lifesaver gummies is like a bonus one just like i'm curious because i love those gummies um and i think that these two are going to work the best i'm not sure if these are going to work at all and these ones we'll see and the reason why is because these candies these gummies here don't have cornstarch in them and you don't want cornstarch or not i don't want to say you don't want i don't know if you don't want it i just i have a suspicion based on my experience with this stuff that the cornstarch ones are gonna not work as well but i don't know we're gonna find out um and the lifesaver gummies i don't know i read somewhere on reddit someone said they worked really well but then i read so many people saying it doesn't work for them but i want to try myself let's put these gummies in their bowls and then put some tincture on them these albanese gummies i could not find like regular albany's these are like the natural flavored ones um but they should work the same regardless and haribo i know everyone has access to these ones i feel like these are like a very common one and the main weird ones in the states you guys don't have many yards do you you guys well it's the same brand that makes all the sour patch kids and it makes um fuzzy peach and cereal shower blasters in canada they all say manyards on the package but in the states they don't say minions and do you guys have the gummies and like what does this say but anyways and then i like sugar gummies are so good my favorite is the um the dark green one i think it's watermelon so i'm just doing a few because i don't know how these are going to turn out i don't want to like have to waste all my tinctures if they don't turn out i mean i'm going to eat them for god bless but so now i just have my tincture here i store my tincture in the freezer um and i just took it out like half an hour before i don't really actually know if it's best for it to be cold or warm i try to look it up online i didn't really find an answer so i don't think it matters too much okay i'm using a dropper to pour it in oh my god i'm spilling it i don't want to sit down here make a mess okay i'm using a dropper to put it in because i don't want to pour it and then risk um wasting some and then you just want to fill them up to um kind of like you don't well i mean it probably would be best to fill them up completely but i'm not doing that just i don't know for this experiment um so i'm going to fill them so they're like mostly covered but if there's a little bit sticking out i'm not going to worry too much and any leftover tincture it's like i can just pour back into here i probably won't do that i'll just pour into a different container but it's like it's still usable right it's not like whatever's not used this has to get thrown away you can just put it back into a jar and if you notice any flecks of something in here just because i didn't do the best job filtering it because i made this tincture last night because i wanted to do this video today so like i was being a little bit lazy with my filtering okay so now we have our part one done we have our gummies and their bowls we're gonna leave them and i think it's gonna probably take about a day but i'll check in on them and see how they look after a few hours um so yeah i will see you guys in a bit once these have absorbed some more moisture oh and also it doesn't matter if you leave them um covered or uncovered or if it does let me know because again i researched this and it's mixed opinions whether it's better covered uncovered in the fridge there is not really a consensus on what's the best but what i what i was going with was i think it's better out of the fridge uncovered but don't i'm not the queen of soaking gummy so like i don't know um let me know in the comments i'm sure there's somebody who's an expert yeah so i will see you guys in a bit and we'll see how much these have absorbed okay i'm back it's not a day later it is a week later um they took a lot longer to soak than i thought they would so after like a day or two i was like this isn't going as easy as i expected so i threw them into a jar because i was like i don't know i just did so put them all in a jar and then i um let them sit for about a week and i like ship them every day now i'm going to take them out and we're going to compare them on with the sizes of the original see i was going crazy like every single day i'm like looking at them and seeing if the sizes change comparing and like honestly i couldn't see a size change i don't know so we're gonna take them out and see how it is and then i'm going to try each of them on different days without smoking or consuming any weed prior um to see if they work okay so let's first take these out and then compare them to their originals so i'm just gonna use um a fork here and i'm gonna take each of them out and lay them onto this plate okay so i took them all out and then i put um i separated them into their type and then on the bottom row i put unsoaked ones to compare them to and so far it looks like they barely even soaked up anything and i don't know i don't know if they're gonna work i hope they do um but visually i feel like i'm like a little bit disappointed i wanted to kind of see them swell and get larger um because that way you like for sure know that they absorbed it but we'll find out when i eat them so the lifesaver ones legitimately look like they got smaller i don't know how it's possible but they they do look smaller like i don't know i think it's kind of weird and then the elbow needs one keep in mind that the gummies are not a uniform size some are naturally bigger or smaller than others but the albany's like they look like you know what they look like they got a little bit bigger like maybe like a millimeter um on top that's these ones here and then our haribos over here don't look anything different at all they look exactly the same and then the main yards at the top these ones look like they absorb the most out of all of them but to be completely honest it looks they like all look very similar um i don't know uh let's taste them and let's see how i feel in a little bit another important thing to consider is that um the strength of them is all dependent on the strength of your tincture so if you have weak tincture you're going to need to eat more fibers if you have stronger tincture you can eat less so my effects or the strength that i have when i try these is not the same for it is it's not going to be the same for when you make it but um this way we can at least tell if it works and that it absorbed it even though visually it doesn't look like it did so today let's do the albanese ones okay i'm going to do the albanese ones now i'm going to have a um okay they're very firm and albanians are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the t-shirt so this is a regular ebeneze and like it's very squishy and here's one of the ones that were soaked and it's much more firm it's kind of like hard for me to actually um squish it i don't know it just like almost like it's a different texture i'm trying to like get away so you guys can see what i'm talking about okay so here's here's regular and here's like they're pretty soft and this one has a tincture like i can't even like fold it like it was hard to pull i don't know if that was helpful but it's definitely firmer oh and i could taste the tincture it's totally in there i'm gonna eat the rest of the infused albanese gummies and then um i'll report back if it works and this will be the only thc i consumed today i haven't consumed any prior and um i'm not going to consume any while i'm waiting for this to kick in that way if i feel any effects we know definitely for sure it came from the gummies they're honestly significantly harder to treat which makes me like really excited because i feel like that means they probably absorbed it which is good and i also heard apparently like the alcohol flavor goes away the longer you soak it but they're like just as strong so be wary of that i can't taste the alcohol though okay it's a few hours later since i've taken the albanians and i do feel it working a little bit but i do have a very very high tolerance for edibles these days so it is what it is um but i definitely felt some of the effects so that's going to be a thumbs up for the albany's let's see how the other ones work okay i'm back today we're going to be doing the uh uh haribo i don't know why i couldn't remember that but yeah today we're gonna be eating the haribo ones and we're gonna see how they work okay it's like really hard but haribos are always kind of hard for me so let me taste the original one for comparison i can definitely taste the tincture i want to rinse my mouth up with the candy stoma sorry that's gross but um because the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside so when i keep chewing it i can taste it a little yeah it's not much firmer than the original i just tried it i'm soaked one and pretty much the same but the fuse one seems a little bit firmer i will keep doing these and then i'll see you guys in a bit okay it's a couple hours after the haribos and its same kind of thing small effect but that's not the fault of the gummies it's the fault of me for having a high tolerance so it did work um so thumbs up for the haribos okay it's really sunny so i'm sorry if like you guys can't see me i don't know okay today we're going to do the the lifesaver ones so here they are definitely very firm i have an original here to compare it yummy but um yeah they're very firm i almost hurt to chew on them but that's because i have invisalign i just took it out to eat these but it makes your teeth kind of sore because it's like having braces it definitely takes ting tree but again of course you're gonna have like a tincture taste because there's tincture on the outside so i'm gonna get water so i can do my i can see you know okay so i can taste a lot of tincture while i'm eating it but it's like is it from the outside or the inside so i'm going to put a hole in my mouth i'm going to like suck off the tincture and like try and get off with the water right i don't taste anything sure yet hmm maybe a little bit they definitely feel less tingy or taste less tinctury than the other ones do and here's the original one unsoaked very soft they're very easier to choose like the fact that they're firmer that has to mean something right some of them are like stronger than others i don't know they don't taste as tincture as the other ones did and then i'll see you guys in a bit and we'll see how these work i kind of don't think they're gonna work but we'll see okay now the main yards so i took the um here's like a regular one and then here's a infused one and you can like see they actually like look different like the color looks different i don't know if it's just because of the outside but and this one definitely soft and this one definitely not so soft so they don't taste as strong as the other ones did not the lifesaver ones but the [Music] yeah i don't taste very strong i will see you guys in a little bit uh you know these worked i don't know i don't i don't have a guess if they're gonna work or not we're gonna find out", "8z5bUfY2fJ4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "rVcAB1C-yig": "[Music] hey guys welcome back today we're gonna be making infuse pika pika style candy so all the candy I'm using in the video are infused gummies that I have made in previous videos and I will link how to make them all below but of course you could still use this recipe even with regular gummies the combination of chamoy and tehy is so amazing I'm so in love with it I'm pretty much covering all my candy today and my favorite ones were the gutters oh my god is so good with the gushers I absolutely love it I ate so many of them so I had to make some regular one to two so I didn't eat too many of the infused runs a lot of things recipes use something called a Lucas candy usually it's a mango or watermelon flavored one now in Canada is really hard to find so I just looked up the ingredients online and figured out how to substitute it and I'll show you guys how to do that in this video [Music] here's what you're gonna need a variety of infused candy or not infused it's up to you all of these are gummies I have made slash infused and I have videos for them on my channel so I'll post the links for each of them below some Tajin chamoy and powdered sugar now these next ingredients are optional but they're commonly used in pika-pika style gummies it's definitely not essential but it does add a nice little extra flavor as well as a bit of sourness if you like that if you're familiar with making these gummies you've probably have already guessed that that ingredient is the Lucas candy powder all commonly in the watermelon or mango flavor unfortunately that's not something I could find in Canada which is really disappointing because it looks delicious and I really wish I could try it but I looked at the ingredients and pretty much it's sugar salt citric acid and chili powder as well as artificial flavor that will be mango or watermelon depending but since I can't find it we are going to use sugar citric acid and chili powder if you like you can also use watermelon or mango flavoring oil but I did not have any on hand you'll notice that I haven't given any measurements and that's because this recipe is entirely to taste but I'll try to give the approximate amounts that I was using here I have about 1/3 of a cup of icing sugar and I'm gonna pour in some chamoy now less is more because you can always add more but you can't take it out once you've added too much so if you do add too much just add in some more icing sugar to compensate you want very little you want this mixture be very sticky I used approximately one and a half tablespoons of joy so once I mixed it all together I'm going to put in the microwave for about 20 seconds to melt it so I can stir it and get this really nice glossy delicious looking mixture and then we're just going to stir and press out those clumps of icing sugar now I'm adding in about three tablespoons of regular granulated sugar if you're using one of the mango or watermelon Lucas powders you don't need to add the extra sugar and the citric acid and chilli powder I'm going to add but you can if you like - like I said it all comes down to personal preference with taste so you add whatever works for you and now I'm heading about half a teaspoon of citric acid my taste testers told me it was a little bit too sour so if you are sensitive to sour maybe use 1/4 or 1/8 of a teaspoon now I'm adding in chili powder that's about half a teaspoon as well more of this would have been good it doesn't make much of a difference if you're using the Tiki in any way I recommend adding more if you prefer it to be a little bit more chewy and spicy if you wanted to use the watermelon or mango flavoring oil you would added min now just a couple drops will do now I'm just grabbing a little container that has a lid and I'm throwing my first set of gummies which is the peach rings and then I'm gonna drizzle on just a little bit of this mixture again less is more you can always add more but you can't take it back I've made this before with too much and ends up just being a goopy mess so just do a little bit really less than you think you need and then shake shake shake shake a bunch and if it still is not coated then you can add a little bit more I use a very small amount on this you can see they're all very well covered and then now we're going to sprinkle our tajin on and again this is to taste so you can add a little bit shake it up try them and see if you want to add more you can add in some extra sugar some citric acid some chili powder it all comes down to what you like you can experiment with different batches and see what your taste preferences are muy bien they look wonderful the hardest part of this whole thing is trying to not eat them all while you're making them but I had to have some restraint since they are infused on that note for extra strong candies you can throw in some tincture or infused oil or infuse sugar or anything along those lines into your chamoy mixture and that will make them extra strong although I don't recommend using coconut oil because I think you could taste it but tincture would work wonderfully and I do have a great recipe for it which I will post below as well anyways I am now doing the exact same thing but with the gushers and my favorite today rego adding some extra sugar and then some citric acid and some chili powder and I'm pretty sure I'd go and grab more sugar off-camera because I just like it real sweet and then we go shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake until they're all nice and covered oh yeah looking good looking good and then we're gonna add the Dean this is where I should have also been adding the extra sugar and the chili powder citric acid etc I don't know why I added it with the sauce in the end it doesn't really matter but it is important to do the sauce first and then the tahini after when you have the extra sugar or the citric acid or chili powder really doesn't make much of a difference so yeah so we're loading that up with some bean shake it up and there we go beautiful while we're here let's get a little close-up of those beautiful peach done means absolutely delicious you can almost smell them through the screen now on to the last gummy fruit snack is that what you call this root by the foot so we're just going to spread our chamoy mixture onto the snack got me I don't know why I don't know what to call this the candy so we're just going to spread it onto the candy and then we're going to sprinkle on our Tajin and I also of course went overboard and added a bunch of citric acid and I think a little bit too much tajin I found this one was like a little bit salty and like I love salty so it was all good but just a heads up less is more you can always add it after but you can't take it off actually you probably could just take it off by kind of sweeping it off with your fingers but that makes mess and we don't want that and I spoke too soon our last treat is the infused nerd rope so I'm gonna do these one by one because I'm not sure how well the mixture is going to be able to get on it just because of the larger shape that it is and my make sure it's starting to be a little thick and harder to get to evenly distribute so you could also throw it in the microwave for another 10 20 seconds to just kind of make it a little bit liquid here and a little bit easier to spread now we're gonna add in our Tajin and sugar so you guys the chili powder etc I kind of just have a mixture going on the side there and then we're gonna shake it up and then repeat the same process with the other nerds rope and there's our last one excellent they look wonderful I am totally in love with Mexican style candies we don't have a lot of this type of stuff here in Canada so please let me know for something you guys think I should try that I would like if I loved this type of thing which I totally do [Music] it's so good with the spicy on it spicy and three everybody loves spicy and sweet thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much have a great day [Music]", "tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them

"L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "cyBouHFm7SI": "busting the three most common myths about cbd gummy bears who'd have thought it gummy bears and cbd ending up not only being used together in the same sentence but actually in the same product it seems that there is little left in the world that we should be surprised about but before we get too cozy about the combination of cbd and gummy bears which all sound very innocent and sweet pun intended there are three myths surrounding them that we feel ought to be blown apart first of all cbd gummy bears do not contain the same amounts of cannabinoid some gummy bears have five milligrams of cbd in them while others have 15 milligrams now that's a huge difference in potential potency what is a good idea apart from reading the ingredient section on the bottle or packet very closely is to try and ascertain what strain of cannabis plant the cbd came from and if you can't do that at the very least try and find out how the cbd was extracted from it second cbd gummy bears do not offer fast relief contrary to what many say how do we know this well if you watched our video on cooking with cbd and the mistakes you can make there you'd understand why it only takes a few seconds to feel the effects when smoking cannabis because the cannabinoids in the cannabis enter the bloodstream almost instantly however when swallowed any form of cbd has to be ingested and then the cbd is absorbed into the bloodstream usually after a delay of approximately two hours now correct us if you think we're wrong but to us that isn't rapid thirdly and finally not all cbd gummies are safe to take the reason they are not safe isn't because of the cbd but more the case of where the cbd comes from now that cannabis can be legally grown and cbd oil can be used in certain products agriculture has begun to do what it knows best increase crops through heavy use of pesticides the problem is those pesticides tend to end up in the cbd oil that's then used to make gummy bears many pesticides are known to be carcinogens while others can have adverse effects on the body's organs if you want to take a gummy bear that is a bit safer then take one without any cbd in it though that isn't totally safe either as gummy bears are full of sugar and it is well known that too much sugar is bad for you the truth is virtually everything is bad for you if you take too much of it so use cbd gummy bears wisely and do your research and homework before you buy any we'd love to know if you've tried any

what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "IyGFROcaLOE": "I'm a gummy bear yes I'm a gummy

pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like

lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can

We're making gummy\nbears from scratch. I'm Jessica Lugo, a.k.a. Bake Me Pretti. And some of you might know me\nfrom hanging out with Martha Stewart on Bakeaway Camp. But on this show, we're\nmaking store bought guilty pleasures from scratch. Look how tiny they are. Oh these got little\ntrees on their bellies. So we're going to make one\nflavor of gummy bears today. We're going to use\nGatorade orange, but you could swap it\nout for any Powerade. Or you can use lemonade,\nstrawberry juice, orange juice, add in some ros\u00e9,\nsome whiskey, some fireball. And you could just switch\nit out for the same amount, the same measurement. But I'm going to give you\nthe generic recipe for them and then you go wild, you\nmake them, and you tag us, and we'll repost\nyour gummy bears. Yum. You're going to need 3\npackets of unflavored gelatin, a 1/2 cup of Gatorade, or any\nflavored liquid you desire, 2 tablespoons of\nsugar, and about 3 tablespoons of coconut oil. You're also going to need a food\nsyringe and a gummy bear mold. So first things first, we're\ngoing to take our coconut oil and we're going to\npretty much drench this whole gummy bear mold. This is what's going to\nhelp so that the gummy bear doesn't get stuck to your mold. So be sure to get all\nup in those crevices. So now that our mold\nis all oiled up, we're going to take\nhalf of our Gatorade and we're going to\nput it into the bowl. We're going to put in our sugar\nand our 3 packets of gelatin. And with a fork, I'm\ngoing to give that a mix. So now that that's mixed up,\nI'm going to let this set and put this aside. And then we're going to take the\nremaining liquid that we have here, and we're going to\nbring it over to the stove, and we're going to\nactually simmer it. So now we're going to bring\nthe sauce pan to medium heat, and we're going to put\nhalf of our liquid, whether it's Gatorade, lemonade,\nPowerade, whatever liquid you want to make these\ngummy bears with, we're going to bring\nthat to a simmer. So now that our other\nhalf of our Gatorade has been brought to a simmer,\nwe're going to add it right into our gelatin sugar mixture. And we're going to\ngive that a mix. The reason why I'm using\nGatorade and not regular juice, which you can, but I want to\nget that see through gummy bear look. Everything has liquefied\nagain, and we're ready to put this in our mold. So I have this funny\ntool, and we're going to use that to\nhelp us so that we don't get it all over the place. All right, you're just\ngoing to use some pressure here because the air is tight. Use your muscles. And you are going to slowly\nbut surely get that liquid all the way in the syringe. And we're going to gently\npour the liquid into the mold. We're all done. Now that these are all\nfilled up, got a little messy but that's no big deal,\nwe're going to stick these into the fridge, and\nthey're really not going to take that long to set up. Maybe 20 minutes. And we'll just keep\nmaking some more. They're so cute. If you look up close,\nthe coconut oil has turned white in\nsome places, which means that you\ncould just literally peel it off with your finger. So what we're going\nto do is start popping these little guys out. Oh my goodness, they're\nso start thinking cute. And just like I told\nyou, the coconut oil is no need to worry,\nbecause it hardens and you can just wipe it off. So this was super\neasy, super fast, and you can literally\nmake whatever gummy bears your little heart desires. So go ahead, have\nfun, experiment. Post them and tag us so we\ncan share your gummy bears.", "TJSndshO848": "today mom and dad are going to be doing a review of the harab or a blind taste test of the Haribo versus the Sour Patch watermelon gummies the sour pouch are 14 calories each and 98 cents in a box at Walmart and then the Haribo watermelons are 25 calories each and one dollar for the whole bag so as you can see they look very very different this one is obviously much larger it's also much softer and this one is very hard and much smaller so that allots with a calorie difference I suppose so they will try them right now we're going to start by trying this one I'm ready and now the other one Wow The Giver okay okay look the big nerd one you like the best okay I love the figure that with your sour patch you're both correct the first one were sour patch hmm but it should be noted that the sour patch won't specifically cites our them sweet and Haribo just says soft and sweet I don't think they're supposed to ease out yeah I like the person better just cuz it tasted more warm oh I like the birth 100 favor us first thing right I said I like the second one better but that doesn't mean that I did not like sour patch I still like the sour patch the sour patch was very very like like on a scale of one to ten it was a ten as far as that watermelon flavor I mean they put like the maximum amount that is normal to me the Haribo they they probably only use two like a a seven on the scale of watermelon they just didn't take it to the next level but I really like I like the texture like the texture of Marla better uh they're more like gummy bears or a soft oil mm-hmm but also even though I like the sour patch they were a so incredibly strong that I don't think I would want that all the time where is the Harbo they're just a more pleasurable exceeding experience I think just because they're just they're sweet without being the overkill yeah I'm the Balian of the hormones oh the watermelon flavor is almost not exist and it's there but it's very much well I said about a seven you price like what oh well is a lot less yeah III agree she's they come in a bag I see I didn't know if they were like you just thrown in here or if they were this other bag it is a lot less I was being generous given on the 7 but I still like them yeah I wish I like the texture of these the flavor of those let me just stop them please have a good texture thank you it's not a soft surface they're they're uh they're not hard no no they're not hard to eat or anything like that ever so it's still good if you don't have a layer of side by side I still think they're both excellent games but yeah so it just depends on how much watermelon flavor you want if you want something really really intense then I would go for the sour patch if you want something just sweet no water and lighter then I would go for the heart I agree yeah so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "gFSm3tGZQgA": "hello iris Oh SOS here and today we've got some cannabis infused chuckles and some stoner patch dummies that have already opened people because more missus does my brain in and once not texturing but that's not over here nor there so let's have a look and so it's time to patch dummies I've opened up the red one and we've had a nice little looking side of it the textures absolutely bang bang swangs Wang you can taste the weed edits injuria but there's a real real strong taste of sweet sugary and then a kick of where these are very very nice one for you one for me I must admit these are very very nice next ones chuckled infuse gummy worms my mouth is watering to know that the oil want it though would you reckon they're just injected it or what or make them sour patch Tommy's oh wow I just finished to them mouth watering whoa let's have a look at these worms are saying then very tough taste better than the stone the patch dummies oh they're the winners involved at the choice at least two or go for chuckles the taste is more souvent and less explosive but if you do like your tangy bangbang and go for the sour patch Tommy's pleased our people I hope you enjoyed", "3xr950dwJhY": "Inside this huge pizza box is\na huge pizza made of gummy. [MUSIC PLAYING] In order to make something\nthis insanely large, I knew we were going\nto need a pro, which is why the Gummy Bear Guy is here. I made a pizza this size, Jamie. I'm pretty sure I can make\nanother pizza 80 times larger. OK. I'm going to let\nyou do your thing. I can't wait to\nsee what happens. I got this. So, Jamie says he\nwants this thing to be roughly six foot in\ndiameter, so half of that is 36 inches. That'll be a gummy pizza slice. Now, all we have to\ndo make the real one. [ELECTRICAL SAW BUZZING] I think it just dawned\non me how many triangle cuts we need for this. [ELECTRICAL SAW BUZZING] We got all our\ncomponents cut out, we've got the bottom, the box. The box will hold the master\nmould and the silicone that we're going to\npour in to capture the shape, the overall\nshape of the pizza. What will I do now is\nbuild the actual pizza. I'm going to layer our\ncrust and our cheesy surface of the pizza. The best way to do that\nis to slather some Bondo. Now, what I'm making, basically,\nis just my interpretation of hot melted cheese. So we've made what we deem\nto be a fair representation of a rather large\nslice of pizza. It only needs toppings now. I think most pizzas have\nthe standard pepperoni as an ingredient. It's an easy thing to make. I just need some texture. It's just that easy. We'll make about\neight of those, I'll make a cup of olives,\nmaybe some banana peppers. We've got ourselves a\ngrandiose 3-foot, 36-inch pizza for Jamie's request. I can't wait. So we've got these\nawesome pepperonis. Like, how do you-- Now, you see it's\ngot a sheen on it. That wax. Right. I want to add more wax, so\nuse that is as your glue. And now pick a slice. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] And as a final step,\nall we got to do is add a little bit\nof a release agent, melt the wax and everything,\nmelt the whole piece together, and that's it. This is the business\npart of this. Everything we did is getting\ncast in this [INAUDIBLE] silicone, and if we're lucky\nthat we did everything right, we won't see any leaks,\nnothing will move. This is liquid gold. All of our hard work,\neverything we've done, it all comes to this. We're going to pull\nthe silicone mould out and hope that we did\neverything correctly. If we did, we'll\nhave a candy mould. It's a little like\nwrestling an alligator, but there's your candy mould\nfor a giant gummy pizza. OK. Let's make some pizza toppings. Jamie, I want you to come\nin and help me with this. You're in charge of pepperoni. OK. And just fill up the round ones. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] And that's it. That's the final step. You've got 15 pounds\nof orange gummy crust, and all we have to do\nnow is wait 12 hours and see how it sets up. It's been 12 hours since we\nput the candy in the mould. Let's see what we've done. You want to eat this? We do. Let's pull it out. OK. Let's do it. Grab hold it and ease it on out. Oh. Yeah. Wow. What? Oh, snap. Yum. Oh my gosh. Is that good enough? Yeah. We just need like seven more\nto make a whole pizza, though. Oh, god. Let's get to work. Yeah. Pour some more candy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jamie, it's at least 250 pounds. That's 500 servings per slice. Should we dig in? Come on, everybody. Check it out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Believe it or not, this\nsuper-sized slice is very real, and you can get your own.

market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints and with the acquisition of good co-op will be selling baked goods also made with love [Music]",

stir stir stir a little gelatin okay beautiful we got a little mix now we come around with a bit of food coloring to get off but look at the desired color look at that maybe a little bit more because

"YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again

that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "HtaG8WmgrFk": "three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "1Y7hrWj9sY0": "hey everyone its James from fun foods and today I'm just going to make these Mountain Dew gummy bears now this was a request video and they turned out amazing so keep watching I'll show you step by step how to make these now the first thing we need to do in a medium pot we need to add two cups of Mountain Dew soda to it then just bring this over to the stove until it starts to boil while we're waiting for our mountain dew to start boiling get out a large pot and to that we want to add one more cup of Mountain Dew soda and then I have three of these packets of unflavored gelatin just take it out and sprinkle it on top of your Mountain Dew you don't have to mix it just sprinkle it all in there now just let that do its magic while we're waiting on our other mountain Dew to boil alright so when your Mountain Dew starts to boil we'll just turn off the heat and take it over to our work station now just pour your boiling Mountain Dew into your Mountain Dew that we poured the unflavored gelatin on and mix it in you want to mix it for about five minutes until all that unflavored gelatin has dissolved and at this stage now that all our gelatin has dissolved what I'm going to do is divide this I'm going to keep some of them this color this regular Mountain Dew yellow color and some of them I'm gonna turn green so I just want to pour some in another bowl not a lot and add a little green food coloring to it mix that up now just let these sit out for a little bit before we put them in our molds because I'm using plastic molds I don't want the heat the hot liquid to melt my plastic molds so you have to be really careful if you're using silicone molds you can put them in there right away that's fine but plastic molds be careful don't let them be too hot or they'll melt your molds now I'm going to transfer my liquid into something with a pour spout just to make it easier for me to pour them into our molds so they don't go all over the place so the little one here I'm going for the green in big one I'll pour the yellow all right so now I have my mold here and I just have this one template of little bears it's only six of them so I have this little silicone silicone mold it looks like bananas or something just use up the stuff the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill about half these bears with the green and then half with the yellow now hopefully I'll have just a steady hand when I'm doing the yellow we'll see and then just fill your other molds up whichever way you'd like now just take these put these in a refrigerator for a couple hours just until they set well my Mountain Dew gummy bears have been in the refrigerator setting up for about three hours I'm a bit nervous and I don't know if I used enough gelatin they are firm but not as firm as I want them to be so we're gonna try to get them out of here see if we get them out intact and that's always a challenge especially when you don't have a silicone mold so let's try this I'm gonna try with a knife gently to remove this and decapitate it the first one that's not good poor bear taste food anyway don't think it's gonna work out my friends we got to do Plan B we got to make them with more gelatin so since it didn't work out on our last attempt we're gonna try things a little different this time we're still going to start out with the saucepan and we're gonna add 2 cups of Mountain Dew soda to that bring this over to the stove and bring it to a boil while that's over on the stove boiling we have one cup of Mountain Dew in a large bowl this time I'm gonna use five of these packets of this Knox unflavored gelatin and I think that was part of the problem not all the problem but part of it I want to make it a little firmer than it was it was almost just like a jello and not like a gummy so we're gonna add five packets of this and you just sprinkle this in on top of your Mountain Dew [Music] and this time what I'm doing differently is preparing our molds a little bit different last time they didn't come out too well and of course if you have silicone molds use that because there's a lot easier but what I'm gonna do this time is I'm gonna spray this with some cooking spray gently just a little bit and then because I'm extra nervous about this is I'm going to let's wipe a little bit of the excess off it so it's a bit much not dry but just no puddles of spray now we want to take some powdered sugar or icing sugar and we just want to lightly coat this I'm just really going the extra step to make sure it doesn't stick in there now we can just fill our molds I'm gonna do three of them green three um yellow and hopefully they work out this time all right so I have pulled my gummy bears out of the refrigerator they've been in there about three and a half hours and now it's show time to see if they come out of this mold all intact I got my fingers crossed I hope it happens if not we'll have to redo this with some silicone molds so let's see how we did I'll start with the yellow one I'm just gonna kind of pull it away from the sides a little bit of my fingers before I try to pull it out hopefully that will work and see if I can kind of like push it and peel it out looks like it might work oh yes I did it so one of the other ones have come out nicely perfect well now something to taste us I'm gonna try one of the yellow gummy bears the yellow Mountain Dew gummy bears and see how taste tastes like Mountain Dew now I'm do gummy bear it's pretty good and this is the one I didn't put any food coloring in it it was just straight and Mountain Dew so really good well thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching me make these Mountain Dew gummy bears is a lot of fun making these and thanks

closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "Nz3FOoMJAYw": "hey there today i am bringing you a product review and ketone test which has been highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "LL9nVeUI3DM": "hey you're on guys

infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr.

That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love?

And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis?

Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time.

I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess.

It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking?

It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX. Vintage Cactus Cooler\nsoda mesh trucker hat in EX, unused condition. It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick. (laughing) It's a cute cat. - Every cute chicks out there-- - It's a cute chick hat. - Go get this Etsy hat. - Vintage Cactus Cooler soda hat on Etsy. - I can't see out of my right eye. - Get it, get it. Orange pineapple soft drink is what the Cactus Cooler is flavored. Let's get rid of this, we don't like it. (clattering) Is that it? That's the discovery. Cactus Cooler exists. - Dr. Pepper makes it. - Is that right? - And Keurig, what? - Keurig Dr. Pepper. What does that mean? - [Stevie] Did you get\nsomething in your eye? - Yeah, water. (background laughs) - Yeah, Keurig Dr. Pepper, formerly Keurig Green Mountain and originally Green\nMountain Coffee Roasters is a publicly traded\nAmerican beverage company. - Keurig is Dr. Pepper.\n- As of 2018, Oh gosh.

i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "5U1FWD6O54Q": "hey guys welcome back

your mixture the more juice it has the better then you're gonna want to mix your whole make sure mix mix mix mix next year you're going to make sure that you wash your cans before this and once you do apply a coat of this to the lid then you can sprinkle some more Valentina or Tajin onto the top of the can as well as a couple drops or whatever amount you want of chamoy make it look something like

further ado it's a close-up hi Bert Club and get some little bird emojis flap in the comment section taking a look at base edibles they look at these dank gummies and these have 802 THC content of 500 milligrams for this entire package now each dose is about 3 pieces and that gives you about 50 milligrams of THC now eaten well ingesting cannabis is blade different than smoking it when your liver has to process it it gives you a way different hide then when you inhale it's a total body high where I'm smoking it gives you basically just a head um docena says that the appropriate dosage for these is different for each person and been conditioned so freebo taking these willy-nilly make sure that your you know how much they take for whatever problem you're taking them for if you're just using them recreationally still use caution when using or consuming these won't get take a look at some of these out the pack so let's get somebody's out this pack I got over here these are the gummies look like you can see inside here they have a blue one right here I see a blue one in this pack so there's no not really telling what colors you're gonna get um they're coated with like a looks to be like a sugary thing they're pretty soft like they're room temperature so there Gummy's guess if you froze on these stiffen up a lot I'm going to guess we'll eat the green one why not eat the green one and see what that tastes like so just pop this thing I see how we do I burped about to take one of these dank gummies now I have already took one earlier and I can feel fill it slightly I've been smoking all day but it's a very different kind of feeling and it's more of a relaxing feeling I will probably go to sleep right now sleep all night wanna try this bring window you know hopefully it'll uh increased my abilities sleeping Mike I don't typically sleep too well but I'm hopefully tonight these will help me crash there's a very slight cannabis scent from it it smells more like candy than cannabis not sure this is I want to say this might be Apple but also it also might be a line I want to say a Pluto John taste this sugar sugar doesn't seem to have that much of a cannabis taste on it and must be more inside the gummy so I'm gonna pop this in give it a couple chose and see if it tastes like alright that was a very nice apple taste didn't have a nice cannabis undertone to it too very chewy gummy unless you could kind of help with the texture of it yeah we'll check back this is a cold minute no all right berth up almost forgot check it for me for me it'd be very relaxed deep fry sleep forever right now gummies I mean it tastes real good got a nice cannabis tasting [Music]", "-xix6u2w-uc": "guys do i look like wendy from peter pan right now this bow is giving me peter pan wendy vibes i always wanted to be wendy hi everybody welcome back to my channel if you are new welcome my name is cooper new and today we're making another fun little treat in the kitchen we're making champagne gummy bears let's go i'm so excited i'm gonna set these down i made gummy bears once before on my channel it was weird anyway all of my friends and family know my two favorite things on earth are gummy bears and champagne that's it that's all i need so let's combine them there's a candy brand called sugarfina they have champagne gummy bears they're amazing so i'm going to try to make it myself so yeah if you want to see how to make champagne gummy bears it's supposed to be super easy then just keep watching [Music] so for this you actually don't need very many things you just need champagne you need sugar and you need gelatin oh and also gummy bear molds hello duh for right now i have one cup of the root rose is reducing over medium heat once this has kind of reduced down a little bit we'll add another cup and a half and now i'm going to do just a regular champagne i figured it would be fun to try both again i'm absolutely terrified of doing this part oh my god am i doing it i'm doing it oh wow i'm a beast nice i took off the last one with a cork opener i know that's super not how you're supposed to do that but i did it so one cup yes i feel like i should pour myself a glass while i'm making this what do you guys think it is time for some champagne i love to drink champagne everything's looking good these guys are bubbling i'm enjoying my day how's everyone doing are we all doing well okay so let me tell you guys a little bit about the gelatin we're using today agar agar what i'll name my firstborn it is a vegetable gelatin substitute the difference here this is plant-based it's made from red algae without any artificial chemical ingredient regular gelatin is made from skin bones tendons and cartilage of livestock animals yuck that's kind of gross this has fibers calcium iron vitamins so yeah this should be interesting i'm excited to try this this one looks like it's reduced so i'm going to go ahead and add a cup and a half more so the rose one is doing a nice job here so we are going to go ahead and add the gelatin and also the sugar so for the gelatin you're doing one fourth of a cup okay and now let's also add while that's doing that let's add a cup of sugar there we go so we are going to continue to whisk this until everything dissolves and until it really thickens up so now i'm going to do the exact same thing over here for our regular champagne gummies fourth a cup of the gelatin pour that in got it all over me and also a cup of sugar now i'm just gonna go back and forth kind of whisking these guys until they look ready to me i guess take our lovely reduced mixture here this is the rose one and i have out our gummy bear molds and i'm going to use a dropper now this might take an eternity uh to do a dropper and do this but i'm willing okay so let's begin so what's interesting about agar agar is that am i saying that right agar agar whatever is that the freezing point of it you know when the molds get hard is just room temperature so these are already ready to go so that's pretty cool that you can make these so fast i'm telling you these are already ready oops look he's already ready to eat i'm going to eat him interesting but delicious i'm gonna keep making some more i'll be back okay guys here they are uh these are the champagne ones these are the rose ones aren't they kind of cool nice so i just want to show you what they look like if you decide you want to coat them in sugar it gives them obviously a little extra sweetness but they're still just as cute look at that guy these also have a little bit more of a melt in your mouth kind of more of a jello texture than a traditional gummy bear these turned out really well i'm actually really impressed with how quickly the agar agar solidifies just at room temperature it's super fast and yeah these are really good it says that these are best kept in the refrigerator i like the regular champagne ones a lot more than rose ones i wonder if i could toss them and eat them in the sky i'll get it oh close that was way off i don't know what that was nope nope that was just straight up and down that was way behind my head nice i did it that is it for this video thank you so much for watching and i will go ahead and see you guys again in my next one bye", "x_SuyeZ6EZU": "i feel like something's up i feel like i'm being tricked i

holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "jWKESHMUkSE": "I'm a gummy bear yes i'm a gummy bear oh no me no me no me gummy bear gummy bears i love gummy bears [Laughter] I love you gummy bears gummy bears I love you [Applause] [Music]", "jUh5qLq4DVw": "hello friends welcome to leg life in a recent video we showed you an amazing amazing box of mail that one of you our viewer sent us that was filled with Haribo gummy candies now at the time we got the box we were on the AIP diets we couldn't taste them all but today's video we are going to try 13 different bags of hair bow gummy candies and tell you which one we liked the most which one we didn't care for mush well although these bags came from one viewer and the other extra one came from another viewer and we're just gonna combine it in this because it actually is a different flavor than what the recipes are so you guys probably know sherry love's love's love's love's gummy candy they're my favorite they're your favorites I don't mind them and so I think you're probably enjoy this much more than I am but I'm pretty excited we're not going to really do this in any order so sherry the first thing we're gonna try let's start with the original right this is classic Perabo you've probably eaten these a million times there's two like us right the green one is my favorite strawberry I thought there's watermelon oh the green one is strawberry I don't know why I doubted you like this is like your area of expertise and I'm like I think you're wrong delicious hmm just like super good moving on to bag number two I'm pretty excited about these they're the hair boat : ones if you guys remember one of our amazing viewers in Sweden sent us a bag of Swedish candy around Christmas time and we tried it all and one of the things that she included was these cola flavored gummy candies and then these showed up as well these are really good like Cola incoming form it's the weirdest thing it's just super delicious so I like these I think one of the things that I don't like I've said this before on blogs my kind of knock against gummy candies is that they're not like overwhelmingly flavorful like the original gummy candies is like the essence of something whereas like the cola one their thing I like about it is it ollege it has a Cola taste yeah I mean I feel like that with all the other ones like I can actually distinguish all the flavors but he can't I have I have a more refined palate than you have more refined gummy palate it's like what if that's like what you were known for like the world's premier gummy taster I would like that job bag number three we have the Smurfs Haribo okay sherry have you ever had Smurfs before I don't think that I have you'll see that these are like two tones colors this is blue and white it doesn't say anywhere on what the flavors are I think it just tastes like normal like there's no crazy flavor of this and nowhere on the bag does it say what the flavors are it just kind of tastes like heaven normal just fruity gummies pretty smooth shape but there's a verse and how fun is that I guess one mm-hmm and moving on to bag number four this is the first of the sour ones confession I am NOT a sour fan and we have a number of sour ones in here so I'm gonna try to I don't mind it every once in a while but I'm not usually just like a rant or candy oh here's the hard part of these the one I just got was pineapple flavored which I love pineapple flavoring and so it's like underneath this terrible sourness my hat zero sour what you're crazy maybe all of this hours on mine maybe okay bag number five this is also Cola but it's fizzy Cola I don't know how they're gonna do this it says sour sweet and tangy all right let's see what fizzy Cola is it looks just like the cola ones but with like that sour kind of dusting that's basically what it is yeah it's just the it's the happy Cola but with like the sour flavor mmm-hmm not as much of a fan as the other Cola the original Cola is better than the video : mmm and for number six we have the sour sketti it is extra sour oh do you want a lady in the this like you I get pieces you get I'm pretty sure noodle kissing in no time all right here we go Cheers I mean maybe I just can handle this our better rule I can taste the sour in this but it's not like affecting me the flavor I got was like green apple which is already like a sour kind of tart flavor and then the tartness on top of that yeah I got strawberry well I'm not hey the flavors good I just sour just absolutely kills me these I don't mind because they're really not very that work yeah moving on to bag number seven you guys this is the one I'm most excited about I love peach flavored things so like the peach rings this says they're soft and fruity this is hairbow peaches gummy candy oh my gosh they're really good Oh have like that kind of layer on the bottom you don't and this has like kind of like it holy cow and this has I don't I don't think there's something in the middle of it but there's like when you bite into it it's almost like there's like a jelly a juice kind of thing in the middle these big fan are amazing no wanna sit here the rest that we like stop filming the video and the rest is just like us binge eating a whole bag of peat rings now moving on to bag number eight these don't look very fun to me these are sour cubes exotic exotic flavors okay so it says we have the flavors in this our dragon fruit sour gooseberry sour mango sour plums our passion fruit and sour blood orange I am going for a mango is a passion fruit is what color like the orange one there's your sour passion fruit you're welcome I'm gonna get my sour mango cubes Cheers yeah cubes the mango is delicious - feels really good very sour just kind of has like that sugary stuff on the outside of it yeah I expected those to be the most sour of all these because of the package it's like zing and mega sour cubes no they were delicious though and now on to bag number nine did you ever think that our channel would basically turn into us sitting down eating all bags of gummy bears no but I'm not opposed vac number 9 is the harrybo frogs now these look good because shows mentioning about the peach rings it was kind of that white foamy underbelly and then the green frog and it says that these are I don't know what flavor they are they smell like green apple let's see if that's what they smell or taste like it he's old to me do you really find like maybe when you're getting your Easter basket out from the year before and there was like a piece of candy in your labor only a year old they can eat it and you eat it now just taste so old I'm not I'm probably getting that so anyhow kind of the consistency of like the other brand I don't know what branded as one of those peed rings like that very and just the gummy on top but definitely green apples green apple that's the flavor not bad I think once I got past that kind of I don't know the stale taste I know why I had that to me you actually wasn't bad great bag number 10 this is sour streamers I think these are gonna be bad these could be a little bit rough let me see if there's flavors there's blue raspberry cherry orange and apple tap cherry the red cherry please carry oh man and these are like oh boy here we go there's no way you don't think that sour I mean is there but it's not like no it's there who likes this stuff okay so that sour hit me right at the end there that that has a kick I also just commented to him I'm starting to feel a little upset Oh over sugared pick upset stomach a little bit this is a lot of sweet you mean you're not used to normally just on a random Tuesday night sitting down eating a dozen bags of gummies no I mean we've only had one for me to it it still that's a lot it's the law and we still have three bags to go oh okay this next one I'm a little bit nervous about just because I really hate snakes yeah no it's not snake bands in this house and this is called rattlesnakes just like like the gummy were on a version oh okay yeah oh yeah looks just like a normal for a look at me worm normal traditional I do like gummy worm better than gummy snakes because we hate snakes right I mean I'm not a big fan of worms either but I'm more of a fan of worms nemyt fan snakes right mm-hmm I don't feel like there's many worms that will try to kill you not many that I know okay the last one of the original 12 is also snakes it's twin snake that's sweet and sour so here are the combinations okay I'll say sweet first and then the sour okay cherry and orange apple and lemon and blueberry and black currant the first one double you say okay I get blueberries and black currant okay I'm gonna go for the Apple lemon because that's what I grab so you see basically it really is just like two of them different flavors combined they're sick together it's not great I don't taste this hour at all right here hmm I do a little bit just cuz I have lemon mmm gross I hate lemon flavor stuff Trey loves lemon flavor stuff it's so weird so we're not moving on to the 13th and final bag this is one that another viewer sent us we're pretty excited about this because this is mystery flavors so I don't know how we're gonna do this oh details are on the back so what we're gonna do is we haven't read the back of your other back now I have not read the back have you really I really have not hmm I promise tell us down below if you think Sheri has actually read the back I'm skeptical here's we're gonna do is we're gonna each start with one color we're gonna start with blue okay then we're going to give it a sniff smells like a gummy candy yeah and then if you know the flavor y'all know I would guess like blueberry or a blackberry I would get blueberries well it's a little different now here's the problem though if we look at the back for that flavor we're gonna see the rest of them so let's do one more let's each do a red pink right there okay there's pink so we both gets blueberry for blue now we're trying to pick one watermelon yep it's watermelon oh my gosh and it tastes like the watermelon like bubblicious gum it does whoa wow that is the best okay let's see if we're right apparently we have to go to Haribo calm just super super right you guys I'm gonna be honest we're not gonna do that we both agreed watermelon fairly cons and the first one was blueberry and I know this is Lauren we're gonna say that we were right on we're gonna say that we totally got that right so Sheree now that we've had 13 different kinds of Haribo coming these dummies tell me what was your favorite what was your least favorite of all of them I actually think that the streamers from Riley favorite because they really did like just kick you right in the face these were my least favorite - I will say this if you're a sour fan oh they're probably excellent probably love those those Riley's favorite what was your favorite it's sort of a tie oh I'm very curious to see if we got the same answer I really like the watermelon in this mystery and then I like the peach you guys our marriage is so strong and we are such a perfect couple because here's what I was gonna say I was gonna say that if I could buy a whole bag of just that watermelon that would probably be tied with these as my favorite we answer exactly the same way we're the best thank you again for sending us these you guys are so generous to us we loved loved loved to get to try this and the nice thing is that now we're gonna have Haribo gummies basically for months in our house although I will say the peach ones amazing we do want to hear from you guys let us know down below have you tried any of these have you tried all of these which one looked the best to you would be me would you be the most interested to try which one did you think look gross and then also are you team sweet or team sour I think I would say both of us team sweet for sure I don't mind this our I really do actually love like lemon and lime and that kinda stuff like I can just eat them straight why I know but I mean I just like it but um those streamers were a little much a little much this was kind of fun and fun thing to sit down and do we've had these obviously for a few weeks now and we've been wanting to dive into them so it's fun to finally get to dive into them and I love that our final answers exactly the same we love you and we'll see you on the next leg life video [Music]", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to

does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and

the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "0X5fqRx_ppc": "hey guys and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want

"hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to

[WHOOSH] They are the Gummi Bears! [MUSIC PLAYING]", "P_KArHdguG8": "What's the story behind gummy bears? How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "U3FvHNl2k58": "hey everyone i'm Shereen from mypaynecenter.com\u00a0\nthe cbd headquarters hey today i want to try our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and

wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a

a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "0HNsKjqC8iY": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying some gummies I have the Crayola gummies or watermelon slices I have the Sunkist fruit guys these are the sour citrus so we found these at Ali's mom were three nutty nonetheless or two Briana $3.99 and Ollie's and this is a huge bag heavy 32 ounces that's 28 and these are watermelon slices and and Kevin and I did a review of the Haribo and the sour patch watermelon I wish we had known these were available we would have thrown these in the mix but those horrible it's our veg are long gone gummies do not last in our house we like to eat them a lot so these are made by Bobbito they have no high fructose corn syrup they're peanut free two pounds of fun it's yes there are 30 servings five pieces on 120 calories oh wow that is some strong don't want stuff like you're sticking your bag in the bag of blood and it looks like a wedge of water one look these are called Joey I'm coming that's over look at me no because of gummy I consider more like the horrible mm-hmm these are more jelly like mm-hmm they're very nice though I like them I think they have more of the green flavor of the watermelon white part yeah the white part yeah I think they have more of that the white part but then the actual watermelon I think if you want more of the watermelon candy flavor you should go you should get one of the other brands but these are nice those are good they're good no I want them yeah there's nothing wrong with them but I actually prefer the other but more just because they have that more of a candy watermelon flavor and this doesn't and there's no sour dose or anything like that like to either so you didn't say that on there is no make sure you made yeah the Haribo I had didn't have the really strong flavor like the sour patch there but I really liked them okay so these are very small little like pieces no these four different ones there is a long orange tangerine and lemon there are 26 servings in the container and they are 100 calories these are made in a turkey heart of different use these were made in turkey ribs okay that's interesting okay slow learner orange yellow and orange and LA and a green so there's a light orange in a dark orange see that's an orange and then this is an orange no that's why I gave you you didn't give me one of these that would have any my water when you need yeah the oranges I can't want to tell there's a little difference once you get next to each other yeah the yellow on the more slippery so yeah okay so you do what do you want first for the matter let's see the one the covered with sugar now these are going okay these are made by the same company that's all right they're both made in Turkey they're both made by the beach house so that said it on the front by Bobbito these it says it on the back so they probably came out of the same place probably I think that's very carefully long it was alright it wasn't the best lawn whenever I say it tastes more like you're eating the skin of the fruit not the actual fruit yeah it wasn't like a long jello which that's the llama and I can look forward but it's like the ski animal I'm saying it kind of tastes like the skin not bad yeah so that's not one we would eat is it well these aren't so the other sour Samara should be orange just daughter okay you know I think about it's supposed to be good I think these are more of jelly like there's some dents or jelly do they come apart pretty easily no that one I want I like the orange it's not the best we've had once again but hate to keep saying that but it's not and there's just other orange that we've had that we like better that I actually do like the orange where I didn't like the line no the other ones moved about did the tangerine yeah that's a Lulu Missy add - I liked a dream more than I do the orange I thought it was sweeter really what didn't you like about it mm-hmm it's not weird plug Oh see I don't think so at all I really that's pretty much that's my favorite so far yeah and last is lemon I don't like the one mmm don't bring up no I was like so Wow the lemons like pledge its yeah it's like a cleaner lemon so honestly I would pass on these oh yeah I would I would pass on both of these well we've tried some pray of love before and we paid a lot for too because they sell them at Toys R Us and we wouldn't enjoy that which doesn't exist anymore unfortunately I miss it but um we went in there and we paid a lot for them and then it seems like the next week was on a dollar treasure so just like boy I got robbed because I paid like four times the amount but so we have reviewed the Crayola in the past and there's just nothing special they unfortunately they they just scrap select their name but they allow their name to be used just like Godiva has with a lot of things and they shouldn't they allow they're going to be used and then they put out these this mediocre product and really it should be more of an embarrassment to the company they should take their name off of it so so the one on does have a strong flavor it's just not the greatest flavor it's it's not a flavor of the watermelon you want yeah it's not sweet bright pardons yeah when you get a watermelon you don't say oh I can't wait to get to the white part yeah yeah so it's not the part of the watermelon you really want even though they're not horrible or anything it's just I would pass on Oh yes so I hope this was helpful to you and that you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "sqViTVRUH3A": "what's up you guys thank you so much for tuning in to another episode of couch lock news i'm emma and i'm super excited to be talking to you guys today about the wanna gummies that just launched at move dispensaries here in florida i've tried wanna gummies before in the past when i've gone out to colorado and out of every edible that i tried out there that were gummies they were hands down my favorite so i was really excited that move announced that they were bringing wanna to florida so i could finally get my hands on some tasty edibles so a little bit about wanna brands they were one of the first edible companies to launch in colorado back in 2010 and the thing that makes them so unique is they're made with all natural ingredients they're vegan gluten free and they're pectin based gummies now pectin is a fruit derived alternative to gelatin and it's really great because it also helps the gummy maintain its consistency so you know if you leave your gummies in your car in the hot floor in the sun they're not going to melt they're going to maintain that shape and consistency so it's a really great alternative in my opinion another thing about these gummies is they are distillate infused and they contain terpenes to help determine whether the gummies are going to give you indica effects or sativa effects or hybrid effects or whatever you're looking for one thing that i find curious about that is i am pretty sure that the way terpenes digest through your body they don't pass through the liver and everything so you really don't get that terpene effect off of edibles especially because the thc gets converted into something else which gives you that more like relaxed body high so i'd like to know what you think if terpenes make a difference for you and edibles or not because personally i don't think so but they're advertised as having strange specific effects so i guess we're gonna find out so this is what the wanna package is going to look like you can tell that i have not opened these yet i picked up the blueberry indica ones because i've tried all of the flavors in the past and the blueberries are hands down my favorite that and the mango ones of course we're filming so these child resistant containers are able to open by pinching them on the sides and you kind of like have to pinch it really hard and you just pull off the top the gummies per florida state guidelines are wrapped up in this little baggie with a thc symbol so you know that these are thc gummies i kind of always have a i don't have a hard time opening these bags because i got it like before i could even finish my sentence now one thing that's different about these gummies in comparison to the ones that they produce in other states is florida does not allow artificial coloring in their edibles so these are basically like a light yellow or clear color and they have the thc symbol on those as well these are like kind of coated and like it's not sugar i don't really know what it would be because they're sugar free um but it's coated in like this like powder this crystal thing which helps it from sticking together and getting all nasty in the car or in the heat or whatever but these gummies are 10 milligrams each and you get 100 milligrams per bottle and that's only for 25 dollars which isn't really that bad especially if you get them with a discount or they're running a promotion you can really get a good deal and stock up on some edibles now for my first taste these taste like wanna gummies thankfully personally 10 milligrams isn't enough for me to get any kind of effect off an edible so in order to give you a true review i'm going to eat 30 milligrams because that's kind of like my sweet dose without getting too medicated but i'll definitely get like the effects and be calmed down hopefully so two more um i'm gonna get back to you guys in about an hour an hour and a half and let you know how i'm feeling two hours later it has been probably about two hours or a half two hours an hour and a half two hours um since i ate the 30 milligrams of the wanagamines and i'm gonna be honest like i was pretty high for a moment kind of like almost not uncomfortably but i was definitely feeling good i was relaxed i was kind of like in my mind a little bit i was like laughing at stuff but yeah they were nice they were really effective personally i think these are probably like the most effective gummies that i've had so far from a florida dispensary so i'm going to recommend that you check them out because i'm feeling really good right now and i don't have a lot of anxiety and you know they're just 10 milligrams each so if you're a beginner you can easily cut them in half and get five or just try a 10 but yeah i'm a big fan of the wanna gummies and y'all should check them out thank you guys so much for tuning in to this review of the wanna gummies remove if you like this video give it a thumbs up let me know in the comments below if you've tried the wanna gummies before yet what you think of terpenes being put into edibles and subscribe to couchlocknews if you're excited to see some more videos more importantly you guys stay conscious", "HPimeP9aCrg": "okay guys this one is super wild mojito gummy bears and I know many of you going wait a minute Skye can you do that hey hey hey hey you know liquor police out there I mean

these mojito gummies be perfect for your diet", "JLJ1cNBR4gA": "[Music] hey [Music] ah uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow", "oOQlSEMnQs4": "hey Ron today I'm gonna show you guys recipe that I use from vegan gummy bears or any governor lolly as I guess these are great because they are really simple to thank and they avoid gelatin which is obviously ground-up animal hooves they avoid artificial colorings such are quite high quantities and a lot of volleys and they avoid excessive sugars and preservatives as well so they're really awesome thing to be able to do and you can personalize them I would recommend having a mould that has more than one more than one slot I only had an individual coming to be involved which was quite tedious but you can also just pull the mixture into a tray and louts it and then chop them up into little kind of cube lollies as well so I'm using a few different flavorings here which I'll show you guys the basic principle that I'm using is one cup of liquid to four tablespoons of agar agar powder so firstly I'm making a vanilla almond milk flavor and for that I'm using half a cup of almond milk two tablespoons of a baby powder one inch of vanilla pods beans and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia-sweetened and I'm just putting into a pot my half a cup of almond milk and then I'm adding into there my two tablespoons of a bag and just mixing it through thoroughly and I'm squeezing out my inch of Anila pods beans and putting them on the neck I'm adding in two tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten now mixing that up and putting it over low heat and allowing it to come to a seminar it will simmer for a couple of minutes and then it will start to thicken up nicely so once it's thickened up I'm taking my mold and I'm pouring a small amount in there and you can just put it in the freezer for 30 seconds or less and all sit really quickly and then you can pop out your first gummy beer or first tray of gummy bears hopefully and you can store them in the fridge next I'm going on to make the strawberry flavor that I'm using a quarter of a cup of strawberries a quarter of a cup of water two tablespoons of agar agar and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia like before sauce the same process I'm measuring up the berries with the water and you can strain them through some cloth and I'm just using a cheesecloth or a nut milk cloth to strain the berries through and then I'm adding my two tablespoons of agar agar powder and mixing them through and adding a small amount of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia just sweeten that and then I'm putting it on to low heat allowing it to bubble to and pouring it into my mold setting it and popping them out so next one that I'm doing for this as blueberries and I'm just using a quarter of a cup of blueberries and a quarter of a cup of water 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and some maple swimming pool stevia again and it's just the same process you could strain the berries or just puree them I'm actually leaving some of the pulp and this time it's quite nice like that and then pouring them into my molds once they've simmered with that guide a powder in here in allowing them to suit you so then I'm making a pineapple flavored one and this is using pineapple juice and it's quite an easy thing to do you could use it with any flavor adjustment also making some orange juice flavored ones as well I'm using half a cup of pineapple juice and add 2 tablespoons of agar agar you can also sweeten it a little bit further as well with some stevia if you wanted to and so I'm just mixing that together and then I am simmering it and pouring it into my molds and once I pop them out I had my little pineapple gummy bears and I also have these orange ones so then you've got some finished gummy bears those are flavors that I really like and they're so simple to do and you can continue playing around with all sorts of different flavors I haven't tried it yet but I'm thinking about doing you know like a coffee and almond milk once we milk and also trying different teas as well I thought my golden mango green tea would be really nice with the stevia in it and it would be really healthy as well so various things like that but just basically store them in the airtight container in the fridge for about a week they do sit perfectly fine at room temperature consistency wise but you know they don't have preservatives so you want to make sure that they're fine if you're going to do try this out I would love to your heart grows for you especially if you've got some awesome combinations and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope people wonderful day guys", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye",

Year's this is like the cutest treat and it's so fun of putting the gold leaf in the gummy bear containers I don't know why it's weird that way but yeah I think these are so pretty and they're so

minutes for the champagne into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until philippe salt sprinkle some gold leaf flakes into the inside of a gummy bear mold and gently pour the liquid on top place them all in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully set for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or package them into little cellophane bags for a New Year's Eve

nothing we're good", "uIPRrcxet6g": "g'day guys and welcome today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching

Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "Y974-FWoGTc": "[Music] Cheers because we are making the most fabulous candy for grown-ups ever with my DIY Rose a gummy bears you guys my friends are

stars to really make these Sparkle seriously how fabulous would be PR your next cocktail party yes--why Rose a all day you can put them out in a bowl or a champagne flute even drop them into a glass

version these sparkling gummy bears okay so these are crazy easy to make and as always I'll leave the full written recipe for you guys down below or you can get on my website at Lindsay and baek's calm so first we just place the gummy bear bulbs on a baking sheet and I'm gonna sprinkle some edible gold stars into the molds and I'll leave the link for where you guys can get this online but it's totally optional it just kind of makes them really extra special then we're gonna pour 1/2 a cup of Rose a into a medium sauce pan and sprinkle two quarter ounce packets of gelatin right over the top so if you want to make these non-alcoholic just leave out the half a cup of Rose day and in a quarter cup of cranberry juice with a quarter cup of sparkling club soda so you still get that sparkling gummy bear flavor then just stir this all together and let it sit for a minute so the gels and has a chance to start to bloom then over lo he's just staring a quarter cup of white sugar and if you want you're gonna have a drop of pink food coloring to give it that rosy color then you're just gonna stir the mixture until the gelatin and the sugar are dissolved for the tricks of making these so they stay nice and sweet and boozy is low and slow on the stovetop don't let it get over ninety degrees Fahrenheit so you still get that really intense rosacea champagne flavor shining through and that was basically it now we're gonna turn off the heat but we're gonna leave it on the burner to keep the jealous and warm while we fill up our gummy bear molds so I'm just using a little dropper that came with the mold sweep and also just pour the mixture right on top and use a spatula to kind of wipe away any excess so I got this gummy bear mold online I'll leave a link for you guys so you can get one too but you can definitely just pour the mixture into a regular 8 by 8 inch pan and just line it with plastic wrap that way once it's all firm just pull it out you can slice it up into a little square gumming it so you don't even need the mold at all and they come out totally perfect you got you can kind of already smell the rose day we're just gonna pop these in the fridge to firm up

cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

brother of delta 9 or the thc that you would normally find in marijuana delta a contains similar psychoactive properties as its little big brother delta nine thc but the catches it is still federally legal here in the united states um the problem with delta eight is it's very hard to get it concentrated to give you like a real high it doesn't exist too much in abundance however companies are finding way like 3g to concentrate the delta h delta 8 to give you um a nice cool relaxing experience i took mine about four hours ago it's starting to wear off a little bit uh it came the high high

little look on it cool see it", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "G9F0yXS9oDw": "-Hey!

you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "KuADqkCoK84": "me Erica again we're here gonna do a tutorial about how to make sour worms and gummy bears with Lucas into white this is how you're going to need a little bit of lemon juice you're going to need a weekly stocking or any kind of chili pepper that you want and the turmoil and a bowl and a spoon so

first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "6Wd6j1dhQbc": "What is up, peeps? I'm Jon. And I'm Joey. We're some of the video\nproducers here at Vat19 and this is a show\nwhere we show you something brand new\nat Vat19 and then we brainstorm some ideas to\nmake a commercial for it. We do do that so let's do that. Do do. Do do. We do do that. We do do that. This is something for all\nthe zombies out there. Oh, a little something\nfor the zombies. Not a lot of things\nout there for you guys except for billions of people. And this. To chew on and this. This is for you. Should we peep this? We should peep this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, no, it's a gummy brain. Yeah. That looks about full-size. Yeah. About a-- Maybe a little. Hold that. Man, it's heavy. It's like three--\nis it three pounds? Let me see that bad boy. Yeah, three pounds, four ounces. That's a lot of gummy. That's about the same weight as\nthe World's Largest Gummy Worm that we sell. Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. It's got really nice detail. We'll have to open this up and\nlook at the detail up close. Oh, it smells so good. Fruit punch. Fruit punch-- yeah,\nthat's a really-- I don't think I've ever\nhad a fruit punch gummy. I haven't either. I'm super excited. I'm really excited. How many calories\nare talking here? 100-- oh, only 120 per serving. Per serving. How many servings are\nwe talking about here? Well, about 27. Nope, that's 37. Oh, that's 37. That's a real small\ntext but that's 37 servings of 120 calories. So-- Oh, man-- 4,400 calories. Oh, that's a lot of calories. So basically, if\nwe share this, we don't have to eat\nanything else today. That's our 2,000 calories. We just got it. Let's do it. Oh! Man, that smells so good. Oh. This might be my\nnew favorite flavor. A little brain teaser here--\nthat's a big piece of candy. So how much does an\nactual brain weigh? Six-- that's my bet. 48.5 ounces-- so\nabout three pounds. This is actually really,\nreally close to actual weight. Seriously, that's\na couple ounces off of a real human brain. Let's just go for it. Let's do it. There's a little bit of\ncreep factor in all of this. Oh, this definitely feels weird. Two halves a whole. I am really excited. My mouth is watering. Hey, that's the uncivilized way. That's the zombie\nway to eat a brain. Say what you want, man. That's delicious. Yeah? It is legitimately hard to cut. There we go. Oh, all right. Oh! Oh, my gosh. It's so good. That fruit punch. Oh! There you go. Brains! Now I get it. I've always said that orange\nis my favorite gummy flavor but this-- this might\nbe my new favorite. Really. I'm not even joking. Oh, man, yeah,\nthis is dangerous. I don't want to\nstop eating this. I know. So what should we do in\nthe gummy brain commercial? I mean-- Well, we've been talking\na lot about zombies. Zombies make sense. Shoot this with a crossbow. Yes. Dress up as Daryl. Is that the thing with zombies? You have to shoot them\nwith a crossbow or just any kind of bow? I think any kind of bow but\nThe Walking Dead series, he's got a crossbow. Oh, yeah. OK. [IMITATING RICK GRIMES] Coral! Coral! Coral! Wow, you know what we can do is\ngo back to that haunted house that we found. It's like a real haunted\nhouse but it's not a set. When you watch the\nvideo for the Key Ninja, we shot this video there\nand it's this real house out in the middle of the woods. Yeah. Super spooky. It's just abandoned\nand falling apart. It's actually dangerous\nto walk in there. We can go back there and\nmake a whole zombie video. You know, what we could do\nis go back to Gummy Bear AmeriCorps with Chet Huskins. That's pretty good. You've seen the GBA\nin such hits as-- The Gummy Bear Anatomy. Yeah, the Gummy Bear Anatomy. And the Gummy Gator. Mm-hmm. Man, he's going after it. Oh! Did you eat breakfast? Not really. What would your give me\nif I ate this whole thing? Oh, gosh. Well, you pretty much did\nin the Party Bear video. Can we make some\nsort of music video-- Oh-- Like the Party Bear? They're very challenging\nand time-consuming. They are hard to\nmake but they're fun. They're worth it. Mm-hmm. This would be a good Halloween--\nlike something to set out at a Halloween party. You could make your Oreo\ndirt gummy worm cake. Yeah, you could have a\ndirt cake with a grave. Yeah. And the brain is in-- Put a headstone-- Yeah, a headstone, like the\ngrave and the skull and-- Mm-hmm. I'm still eating it. [LAUGHS] Going to town-- you've got\na fourth of this thing. Uh-huh. That's almost 1,000 calories. I should probably slow down. [LAUGHS] We can do a taste test. Get some real brain, cow or\nsomething, maybe a blindfold, and just eat one. Someone just puts\nsomething in your mouth and you don't know if it's\ngummy brain or real brain? Yeah. Oh! I don't know if we get\npaid enough to do that. [LAUGHTER] I don't think we do. That sounds pretty awesome. I'm sure you guys\nwould want to see that. Yeah, unfortunately. All right. I'm taking one more bite. We should way this\nafter we're done. Yeah, show how much I ate. Yeah. Dang, that was a big bite! [LAUGHS] I feel like I'm going\nto regret this later. I feel like you might. So those were a\ncouple of our ideas. If you have any, let\nus know in the comments and maybe you'll see your\nidea in the commercial when it comes out. That's right. You can get weird with it. It's OK.

from the past ball this one this first game is from today the other game also we have gummy bears just so the first game is i gave my plate today on the 20th of september and the other game was um um it was actually in the youtube membership video so if you guys saw that it was the background gameplay for that but i did want to include it in this video just because i really wanted to make a siege video tonight with these gummy bears and i didn't really have any other siege gameplay that i like really wanted to share with you guys so i have recently started to play ash more and actually really really enjoy playing at i'm trying to learn some of the different operators that i can use so if you guys have any suggestions for good operators for beginners i'm pretty sure i already got it kind of figured out but if there's an operator that you see me not using that you think i you know could be good at then feel free to let me know also you guys all noticed that i increased increased fov to 90 and also i didn't realize that the game settings wouldn't automatically update when i got my 144 arts monitor so i also updated that in the graphical settings and it is beautiful beautiful i love 90 fov thank you guys so much for the tips and also the 144 hertz refresh rate and this game is really really awesome so hopefully you guys are all doing well i really am enjoying making videos for you guys and hopefully you are all enjoying them we are moving up to three three uploads as i commit suicide three uploads per week on monday wednesday friday so i hope you guys enjoy the new and increased upload schedule i think my phone was like interfering with the microphone i got a crazy triple kill there you guys all seem to do really like the gummy bear video the last one that i did that was on minecraft so if you guys enjoy the gummy bear eating be sure to drop a like on this video and i will definitely make more videos similar to this so be sure to um oh excuse me if you have any tips for me i would appreciate if you guys share them with me down in the comments nicely of course but i am trying to get better at siege and i'm getting better slowly but surely but i would like to um really increase my skills at this game i'm slowly learning the maps and the layouts and everything but um any other tips would be great i do need to um go into these maps and like look at like camera placements and where the the walls and the rooms are and stuff so i'm trying to get better at um rotating more and trying to switch up my positions just so i don't um you know sit still all game and get caught off guard i was playing a lot of doc and ash today i just kind of realized that instead of a sledge or thatcher and capkin because those are the operators i normally play although i did play talk in the last video i think because he was like the cover the last two of us is actually me and one of our moderators here on the channel until we clutch up this 2e3 to get our team the flawless actually clutch it up with the uh the cap can trip but still nailed it we got uh we did not get mvp this game however we did go five and zero which is pretty nice i'll take it so here is the second game this is an ongoing match and we came in and we were down to zero so um i kind of expected to just lose either we would lose the third round or we would like come back a couple of rounds um but you'll see how the gameplay pans out i thought it was a pretty cool gameplay so so so so um i just want to drop a shameless plug for the channel memberships here have you made it this far i really appreciate you watching we also have channel memberships available on the channel and a few people have already signed up for the gold deer which includes the benefit of being able to play games um with me and i will you know record and maybe we can get some cool gameplay for the channel um so if you guys are enjoying the content and you'd like to see or see extra content as far as like um like

some gameplay with you guys so that's all if you are interested in any of that feel free to check out in the description if not no worries i don't want to make this too long so let me know what you guys think of the like hand sounds and the cupping like the the whispers with like the cupped hands like this let me know what you guys think of it i've just kind of been including it in the videos recently and i feel like it would sound good but i'm not entirely sure i've made some videos with the um the candy box and you guys seem to really like that i don't have a candy box tower just have the um the pouch with the gummy bears in it but maybe that's enjoyable who knows so so so i need to get some more gummy bears out excuse the sounds unless they're enjoyable then you're welcome i guess these gummy bears are very very good you can't go wrong with some gummy bears let me know what you guys think of the new siege operator i almost have 25 000 renown and i kind of want to know like if he's worth getting and like showcasing he seems pretty cool um just i don't know if it would be worth it for you know because i still have let's dive enough i could probably get two you know like 10 000 renown operators or like a 10 000 renown and a 15 000 renown um instead of getting him but if he's truly that good you know then maybe i'll uh i'll jump on the hype train and make a video for you guys so so all right everybody there it is that is the end of the gameplay i appreciate you guys watching this video i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you sleep very very very well good night",

squishy chewy delicious these are the Haribo called gold gummy bears I'll put a link to in the description if you want to pick these up but one thing that I'm distressed about in the gummy bear world are the albanese candy sugar-free is sorted through gummy bears particularly the 5 pound bag available on amazon.com check it out I'll put a link to in the description but obviously some of you probably know that many of the reviews have been very critical of the Albanese gummy bears and I would just stop you know I'm deeply pained by it deeply pained and I want to read to you some of these descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak for themselves oh man words cannot express what happened to me doctor genius the gummy bear cleanse you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute enjoy if you are like the dozens of people that tried my order run first of all for the taste I would read these a five so good soft true to taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety I was a happy camper but or should I say bought dutt not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose i gastrointestinal experienced oops like nothing I've ever imagined cramps sweating bloating yawn my worst nightmare I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was all like Schiphol apart compared to what's going on inside then game odd the flatulence heavens to Murgatroid the sounds like trumpets calling the demons back to hell the stench like a thousand rotted corpses vomited I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear succumbing to my own boogers but wait there's more what came out of me bubbling so wonder I don't want old Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I swear my fingers were screaming it felt like delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste 100% was aquitted flammable liquid napalm it was actually a bit humorous for a nanosecond as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible and it went on for hours I felt violated what it was over which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day there was still Tommy out of me that I ate a my wedding in 2005 high five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasty Albers so I told her friends about what definitely enema dig it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands silly woman the horrendous sounds a demon screaming your gut is like an alarm clock without the snooze button do not lollygag when you hear them chant you just run and this should go without saying under no circumstances trust it apart I cannot stress that last part I hope you need my warnings and prepare properly treat this as if it were a blizzard and stocked up on TP so there you have it check out the Albanese candy sugar-free assorted fruit gummi bears five pound bag you're going to want to pick them up there good for you these are good too Peter Miranda out", "dTgQEOn-wH4": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to my mexican kitchen here in switzerland the recipe today is for a super yummy sweet snack however you guys want to call it and it's the recipe to make gummy bears or gummies in this case i'm going to be making bears i already made these orange flavored ones they are super cute look but all you need are two ingredients plus water so it can't get any easier than that with halloween this year i have no idea what to expect i don't know if kids are going to be allowed to go trick-or-treating or not but it's always nice to have things to keep them happy at home to make it special for them so these are super fun it's an activity you can do with your kids not dangerous at all and as an option in mexico we have these uh sweet and sour gummy bears and also these uh spicy ones which we like a lot so i'll also give also give you the extra ingredients so you can prepare them with the extra flavors in case you like them the ingredients you need to make your gummy bears are 85 grams of any flavor jello that you choose seven grams of natural gelatin three quarters of a cup of cold water and the optional ingredients are vitamin c powder and chili powder tahin okay so before we get started um you need 85 grams of any flavor jello you want that's up to you guys whichever flavor you like whichever brand you like i'm using jello i like jello a lot but there's tons of really good brands so the brand and the flavor is up to you this particular box is already the 85 grams but they make in many different sizes this big one is 170 these little ones are 25 when i made these orange flavored gummies i used three packages of this one plus a bit more i just had to weigh it so it's not really an issue if you can't find an 85 gram sized box just weigh out your your jello and get until you reach the 85 grams you need for the natural jello what you do is these boxes usually have four envelopes of seven grams each so it's basically one envelope or one tablespoon of um natural flavored jello that's the equivalent so all you need is one envelope from this box and and and let's see oh yeah the the mold you need to make your gummy bears usually these molds are quite flexible so you have to put them on a plate otherwise when you try to transfer them to the refrigerator it's a bit tricky because it folds over and all the liquid will come out so just you need a plate if you don't have a mold don't stress you can use your ice cube tray which i made a few so you could see just don't fill it up to the top they're going to be thinner they also look nice i mean it's up to you guys what you have at home no need to worry or spend money um ice cube trays obviously come in different shapes i also have this other tray that's for jelly beans but you can also make the gummy bears in this shape and they look really cool and well basically that's it now to start the recipe what you need to do is you're going to pour your three quarters of a really cold water in a pan in a saucepan and then you're going to put your natural jello in there don't turn the stove on just let it rest for about three minutes after the three minutes you can turn your stove on at a low medium heat and you're going to start stirring you want it to dissolve well the water gets a bit less foggy it looks a bit more clear don't let it boil you just need the heat so it really dissolves once you see that the water is a bit more clear you can add your flavored jello in there and you keep stirring until it seems that it's all fully dissolved you just need it to dissolve you don't need it to boil you don't need anything extreme in heat just let it dissolve and once that happens you can turn it off you're going to let it rest for a while but while it's still warm otherwise what happens with jello is it gets hard as soon as it gets cold so you don't want it to get cold just let it cool down very slightly and then we're going to start transferring to our mold [Music] okay so um i let this cool down for about one or two minutes tops i just didn't want it to be super hot but it does have to be hot otherwise it starts getting solid and of course this needs to be liquid so that you can fill up your gummy bears or whatever mold you're using for your for your gummies um this particular mold was quite cool because it comes with this dropper so you can fill it in quite accurately you make less of a mess but you can use i often tell people with the recipes i don't want you guys to feel like like you need to buy something you can use whatever you have at home whatever type of molds you have maybe you can use a syringe a cooking syringe or a spoon or a measuring cup anything that you think will work for you use that so now what we're going to do is um oh before i forget if you feel that this is starting to get hard just heat it up a little bit and it'll melt all over again so that has a solution now what we're going to do is we're going to start filling up our gummy bears and then from there once we fill up the whole mold we're going to put it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes passing the 15 minutes you can take it out and you just push them out super easy they don't stick at all you don't need to grease this or anything they come out super easy if you're not using one of these flexible silicone molds all you do is with a toothpick you go around all the outside and then just pop it out it'll come out easily it's a very easy thing it doesn't stick passing the 15 minutes once you take all your gummies out you just fill it all over again and you keep doing that until you use up all your gummy bear mix [Music] okay so our gummies are done um i'll show you guys again i made some of with the leftover that i had i used the ice cube tray and made these cute little squares um but here's the other option i mentioned in the beginning of the video if you want to make sour gummies or sour spicy gummies they're not really spicy for those of you who don't know what tahini is this is the pocket size version like for when you go to picnics it's usually a bigger bottle but i ran out so i'm using my little ones this stuff is not spicy it's actually quite nice because it gives you this explosion of flavors in your mouth in mexico we use it a lot on you press some lime juice on your food and some of this stuff and it's magic so now going back to the gummy bear theme um what you do is i bought vitamin c in powdered version and it comes in these little packages i open one and i put it in a little bowl if you can't find the powdered version that it's too difficult here in switzerland you can also find these that are kind of like alka-seltzer so you put them in water and they just fizz up and dissolve you can just crush it with the hammer or anything until it turns to fine powder so that you can put it on your gummy bear and what i do is you can either put them in here and just grab a gummy and coat it with the vitamin c super healthy and then it ends up all coated with the powder it looks quite nice let me show you these would be the sour gummies or what i did in the other bowl is i did a mix of vitamin c with tahin there's no exact amount you guys can just add as much as you want and again we grab a gummy bear and we coat it this is just here to show you for the video if you want to be super fast and super practical just put a bunch in a ziploc bag or in a tupperware with a lid add the powders in there shake them and all your gummies get coated at once but here for the video i thought i would show you like this because it seemed a bit more practical but this would be the tahin version which is just slightly a bit more flavor but not spicy at all so kids will enjoy it just as an as an idea to put on the table the nice thing about making your own gummies is it's not just healthier but let's say you have a party for adults or for kids you can make the gummies in absolutely any shape you want so if you have a lego party you buy lego molds and you make lego gummies if you have a princess party you make them in little crowns if you have an adult party a naughty party i don't know you pick the shape and you make them whatever shape color flavor you want so that's pretty cool i like that a lot i hope you guys enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next one", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "1dld8NFfnB4": "hi guys so cuties today we're gonna draw a gummy bear so let's get started to draw this gummy bear working the first time I drawing the nose and mouth area so I'm just gonna come right here and draw a curve so this is gonna be a center of the bear so it's just a nice little curve and we're gonna round it off on both sides it's nice and even and we're just gonna draw a little curve that comes in to the center and back so it's kind of like a jelly bean so towards the center and come back down and then at the bottom we're gonna add a curve so they're just going to do the mouth area okay and then right here in the center we're gonna draw a little oval for his nose there okay so then we're gonna come to this side right here and give it a draw circle for the eyes it's around the top right on this corner let's sit here about right here I'm gonna start a hand same thing on this size about right here just try to point across [Music] [Music] there now let's make them draw sec UI someone come in here with two small circles for highlights and the curve line at the bottom then shade in the top [Music] and the lines at the bottom so same thing on this side [Music] okay so we have the nose and the eyes in let's come over to the side right where the eye is we're just going to give it a little bit space and we're just gonna draw a curve right here so but right here I'm just gonna draw a slight curve just going to right drag this point right across that bub right here so same thing and then from there we're gonna come up here you can draw the ear so from right here come in a little bit or you can start right here just imagine this line going through so whichever way is easier for you I'm just gonna imagine that going through and about right here I'm just gonna give myself a little gap and I'm gonna draw a curve all the way over so if you're using a pencil you can just go all the way across and then you race that part later that's easier so we're just going to draw a curve right across so now we have a space for the ears and it's down a little bit more so in here we're just gonna draw a curve for the ears and same thing on this side all right there make sure about the same level and we got a little ears in now we're gonna come over here and tuck this curve in a tiny bit just to define the head area in the neck where it starts ok so then now we can come down a little bit more so we're gonna start to draw the arms so just pop it out a little bit more not too much because gummy bears are pretty compact so from there now we can come and straw the hands so I'll just do this side first so then we can now draw the other side a little bit later so I'm just going to bring this in and curve and come in so let's just same thing on this side so let's see here come down so let's give ourselves appointment drag this right across and above right here in the center area so I'm gonna aim for that point and then once again round it off man I'm going to end at this point about right here then connect okay so now for the body area right here we're gonna come in a little bit just trust slight curve on both sides so we're still keeping it pretty compact and then from there now we can draw the feet so come out a little bit and right here we're just gonna ground it off all right there start to bring it in and go all the way around oops okay and then same thing on this side there's just some days my hands don't work everything goes wrong so high right here okay and then I'm gonna bring this up just like the other side [Music] they're now in the center right here we're just going to add a little curve all the way across and then because this is my Dras acute gummy bear and we're going to come right here and add a little heart and that is pretty much it for this cute little gummy bear hope it inspires you to give it a try and thanks so much for watching if you loved it please give me a thumbs up and share it and remember to subscribe

maybe turtle this is at least a second is it slightly less tedious doing it this way plus tedious we've been doing it by hand oh well it's a lot faster I'll tell ya yeah this board I mean still not really that fast is it just cuz there's so many yeah they're so like it'll still take you forever to do a whole bag yeah is that all one bag over there yeah that's okay awesome yeah they yeah it looks like line them up on the back is the way to go my dad you can do it it's suffereth we're getting there there I got to hurry up dummies thunk OH holy gummy well the gummies Batman so I haven't had gummy bears in many many many years so do each color have different flavors or they all taste the same yeah beacons can't eat bears yeah I think they're actually I think they have like gelatin in them or something oh yeah yeah I don't know jenos Swedish Fish well they're all red so it's probably won't taste red taste right yeah the red tastes a threat to me but the Scandinavian swimmers from Trader Joe's all the different tastes when Max get to it before it plops on the rug taste that was a close driveling drunkies very strong places like chocolate factories yeah that's how the old saying goes anyway yep can he do it has it ever actually fallen off yet yeah that's how I know how much time I have left yeah trial and error I just haven't been down here error and error yeah well how long has it been since it fell down it's been months okay so just in the beginning yeah it's good need adjusting the temperature dad [Music] [Music] to second they dumped abomination neck's is too thick I'm trying to lose weight right oh I was talking about like thick-headed I'll talk about thick-headed you know you could be like ethan klein thick all right so this is gonna be kelly's second bag ohh dummy bears yes yeah yeah you have any tips and tricks for people doing this Ellen well I don't really think many people are doing this at home hello are you I'm good you need any help let me know yeah because I don't think everybody would have proper equipment yeah we don't have the bags at home which I understand because I'm the new girl hmm so I understand that the orange scale is pretty famous I came over from the old country yeah so it's and it's it's very reliable so we like the orange ghetto and I can't imagine there's a lot of people who have machines to cover gummy bears but if they did if they did yeah then sure they should they could totally do this at home so you just pick them up to put them in the bag and blame on the scale all right pick them up and I put them in the bag and then I weigh them on this case in that order yeah yeah unless I'm really close because if you have all right let's let's add a few more do it okay so and you know I think that dark chocolate is lighter than milk chocolate hmm I think I've noticed that like one pound a one pound of dark chocolate is lighter than 1 pound of milk chef it no but if you're covering stuff I think it weighs different that make sense this is all in my head but that's ok ok so when it see then you got to be like oh we need one more it has to be accurate because nobody wants to get gypped on the chocolate mm-hmm that's not fun No so yeah I I got the dark chocolate ones and I have never tried chocolate-covered joiners gummy bears yeah I had before they weren't my favorite but some people are crazy about them right so what do you do what do you do after have you put them in the bags well after I get them wait because I'm really organized so I am like a system mm-hmm so what I do is I'll get a whole bunch together and then after that is I'm gonna weigh them when they're always on a label so should I come back when they're all waiting yeah and then we can like label them and state bloom and then barcode them and then we can get him on the Shelf that's totally fine sounds like fun what is this part 2 and part 3 part 3 we already know so this is part 3 and so what we do is we take the bag are you gonna get all the air out cuz nobody likes stale candy mm-hmm so get all the air out I'm gonna burping oh we burped the bag burps to being everybody and then we fold it nice and snug and then we have to put a label on mm-hmm see cuz presentation is everything how you determine which bag or which color goes on with bag well decision getting necessarily for color but you want a variety cuz nobody likes boring either yes we need a variety of colors and then we need to make sure that we have the right weight on it because if I put this out and I have the 4 ounce label then that's wrong we don't want to do that because you know it's the whole thing not corpse breathing down your neck that's right I mean like because then I'll get fired and I like just started here so I kind of wanna keep my job labeling is everything yeah you gotta have great label with the right weight and you gotta have it pretty and nice and snug because nobody likes that's a lot of things you're under all ones yeah needless to say I had no idea how much detail goes into being a candy wrapper yeah it's it's a little crazy and I also am just scratching the surface to what I'm going to learn yeah so Karen's teaching you the ways Karen is teaching me and your mom is teaching me so I am learning from the experts gotta get I've got to get it right because you know people are used to consistency too when you change something you don't you don't want them to be like aw I can tell Kelly wrap this in yeah and that would be my luck somebody wrap this wrong it doesn't look right I'll take Karen's handiwork we need to we need to repackage the whole thing alright so I know you're gonna keep doing that but can we show the people what you do next after that well then I got a barcode it okay so and oh yeah I have it right here oh boy so we have the dark chocolate gummy bears and half pound because we're doing a half pound and hey careful where you point that gun this yeah sorry all right where's Bowl see I hey that thing's loaded I haven't done anything today so I'm a pointer sorry no he's also had your thumb up - oh did look kind of like a guy yeah I'm not violent I promise I'm a non-violent individual I'm family candymaker that's right you know cuz candy makes people happy so why would you want to be violent mm-hmm so we're gonna paste I was wrong got a piece the barcode in there and do did you do gotta pick the right label and I gotta count how many bags because we don't want to waste labels or barcodes so I've got four five six seven 12 13 14 yup 14 bags those and we're gonna print out the labels so after all of these get packaged up all nice and pretty where you get the barcode on them and then we're gonna get best by dates that's my date yes it's not like the store see that's why I wasn't sure it is a sticker so we know that when you buy the candy it's fresh cuz you're gonna have fresh candy too so I'm gonna pull all of these I'm one have one perp cuz if I did that see any labels there are there would be no room by you might have Best Buy later so one of these I'll give you an example yeah what can you do that again case I missed it slow motion Wow I think people really got that in there and then we need Best Buy sticker but I don't know how long these last so I look that up too because everything that we have is different depending on what the product is dairy okay this is the only gun we use around here man all right so is that the last thing you do other than put it out there well no then I gotta write it on the handy-dandy clipboard so we know how many we have because then when we have the stuff we can put it online for the people mm-hmm and put on the shelf for the people so the people can come to all of the people and buy the candy and the chocolate-covered gummy bears which are ready yeah oh we're so where'd we put it out on the floor and they all have their little spots Olivia's gonna go here we've got our dark chocolate gummy bears and soon we'll have the four ounce and I think later I might be doing some of the milk chocolate gummy bears so that way we'll have these all back to replenish our stock from Christmas because everybody just loves us and just keeps buying it so yeah you know gotta get it out there for the people so it come to a very unfortunate decision this is gonna be our last shoutout video because there's so many shoutouts that people are requesting and we can't get to all of them so we feel really bad for the people who who asked and then never get it and they might be asking like 10 times but if we never see it we can't you know we can't do that shoutout because I used to answer every single comment and you see every single thing on every social media and then we got way too big I was a good thing I'm glad we're getting somebody comment so they can't get y'all I'm glad I'm glad we have so many people asked for shadows and we can't get to a mile but it's unfortunate for the people who are asking all the time so we're instead of leaving a couple people out or a lot of people out in the cold we're gonna leave everybody out in the cold warmer clime yeah so that's that's our solution to that problem it's gonna make the same thing for live streams just because when we do live streams everybody like almost everything will come and just ask them for a shoutout so if we were to do a live stream it would just basically just be us standing here just giving shoutouts and I think people want to see us making candy so if you do want to shout out if you do a super chat then we give you a shout out but other than that we'll we will just be answering questions and stuff for free so anyway to shout outs I have four four I have three ish okay is the an Alexander from Elizabeth New Jersey mm-hmm Keegan Graham from Lowell Massachusetts Carol and Leonard from Calgary Alberta Canada and Jennifer sinkovitz she didn't actually ask me for a shot up but she sent a note a thank-you note saying thanks for your YouTube channel I'm gonna subscriber I like it so there you go Jennifer and I'm not unasked-for shout out the way I'm ending this thing and I have a couple I have to take off my gloves so it's sanitary yeah I can't be touching ears I mean you can't take them off after using the camera to what you want clean candy-making okay it's just that hammer doesn't care about my camera they just care about the candy okay so Jules almond I think on how you say her name happy birthday to Kailyn Brown whose birthday was on December 5th yeah so we're telling you we're a little behind Angeline merger see from South Africa living in China and so she want me to say so that is all the the shoutouts for Hercules candy hope you enjoyed him yeah cuz it was good while it lasted this is the end my only friend hmm this is the end was that from a song I think the doors song probably yeah I'm sure our people will tell us probably [Music]", "7E4h_jZAoII": "we love gummy bears and this

share on my favorite Island and Hawaiian style recipes and today I've got a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "WgipuEpUeXQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you got caught didn't

edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "Yh8snA5aqMk": "I'm gonna be obvious you guys like seven-year-old Dan would be super impressed with how much I just spent on candy what's up everybody today I'm back in the kitchen that's are constantly saying one of two things one when are you gonna be back in the kitchen damn and to never go back to the kitchen man yeah I'm a little sick right now that's why I might sound like this so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a bunch of gummy bears melt them down to make a mega gummy bears first off I got a teddy bear mold rented this yeah I didn't know you could read stuff what I'm like hi there can I get the teddy bear mold no like you want to buy it or do you want to rent what you can rent it so I actually am renting this currently for a dollar ninety-nine a day they didn't have the traditional like gummy bear one so I'm going with this guy four different bags of gummy bears we got green we got red we got yellow and we got blue now I want to show you guys something because I know this is gonna come up this will reuse in a day okay you guys are probably thinking I thought it was like a little gummy bear this is the same material as those little gummy bears traditional stereotype gummy bears that you guys are probably thinking of I was originally at knows the ladies like so what are you doing this was like one of the few times is actually honest through the store associate I'm like I'm gonna develop these data like a huge bear Valachi she's the bigger wise girl Lucy he ate a sack same song with these guys plus it was easier to separate the colors that way so let's go over to the stove and let's melt actually before we do that guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and click the bail free for a limited time right now my subscriptions are educating they're always pretty good guys subscribe my channel let's go okay so to my understanding we got to fill up the pot first and then we're gonna put the bowl in like that and that's gonna kind of heat it up this is a bad idea are we not blocking the air from getting now I'm gonna use a bigger pot I think his bigger brother well I forgot to mention you've got no idea what I'm doing go ahead and turn that up to full okay let's let that boil so we're gonna start off with the red ones okay so it looks like what you've successfully melted a bunch of gummy bears suffer that clump we know this melt a little bit more and we're gonna pour the first layer in our mole I know things get stuck way easier than you think so I'm just gonna put some vegetable oil I don't know if the gummies gonna stick yeah like this is gonna help it's pretty much fully melted looks like sweet and sour sauce here we go now we're gonna do is take this put it in the freezer well that's cooling we're actually gonna start melting the other colors alright next we're gonna do blue I want the bottom of you more blue which is why I poured it we will see down there for our third color we got green that's weird already seems to be melting we can't let water get in there I don't know why but this is so satisfying like the Bears aren't fully melted well you just like stab right through them unless not least yellow my favorite flavor I have favorite color do your thing yellow all right that's three layers in our bear mold the last one is gonna be yellow I better this perfectly look at that I didn't know how much incoming bears together like what the quantity would be when you melt it down but damn that I nail it okay we're gonna let it freeze for about an hour you come back and check on it freeze well my job okay it's been like two hours or like more than that let's see this bad boy oh my god this thing is perfect oh my god it is so stuck to this pan no this feels wrong why does this feel so sexual right now Oh oh my god look at that we even got the face okay stop for sure get to clean my windows after this but it is currently stuck to my window [Music] this thing is so sticky this is a mega gummy bear which is what we've done by melting other gummy bears it's like the Optimus Prime of gummy bears right here yeah I don't know it's her strategy to cutting gummy this is doing nothing oh look at the layers look at the layers beautiful red we've got blue we've got green and then BOOM yellow it's actually really nicely done that is the negev gummy out with sliding already that's the mega gummy bear it's literally the size of my face actually bigger than my face hey it takes you 20 minutes to melt every color of gummy bear it takes like 2 hours to fully cool and on top of that it's loaded with sugar it's now becoming a health nut it was fun it was something I wanted to try for a long time I was so amazed at how well these gummy bears actually melted if you guys want to see a really good picture of this on Instagram follow me at the autocracy scribe my channel if you haven't and I'll see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "92nuXrb59_4": "[Music] we're back again joey we got some gummies

[Music] i once in traffic in florida had a couple there was a black couple they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my

billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i i didn't mean to do i was like i don't know what you're talking about she's like you've been have you been talking to me in the controlling for the last half an hour i was like i literally just walked in the door and then billy had like his little smirk on his face like yeah we've kind of been telling them just like that you were in the in the control room the whole time billy's a menace he's an absolute menace uh he has no supervision he's just gonna who knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles you know so you're actually serious you guys are standing like like we're not gonna do the real one jake we also wanted to test the integrity of this and also the camera like where's ashton kutcher like i feel like actually it's gonna come out yeah i'm so sorry we thought that was fake what do you mean when we kept laughing like you were saying that i was being [ __ ] annoying you", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio

experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if

welcome to WTF where we transform food here at the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so modernist pantry com just search V ghen gelatin in the search bar at modernist pantry com that'll get you to find it from druids Grove it is a wonderful wonderful thing to play around with thank you so much for joining us on WTF where

nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "ZywiDU5cbKg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well

talking people to Instagram and I saw these sprite gummy bear popsicles and I just wanted to see if they're a DIY or D I don't hey guys it's Rachel aka rclbeauty101 and you are watching DIY or D I jumped will retest out crazy DIY projects and see what actually works I really hope these air I D I do because I really want to take a cool Instagram picture of them so I'm going to use these really super nonspecific instructions that I found on the Internet but let's see how it works now what we're going to need is sprite popsicle molds and gummy bears so first things first take off the tops okay so I feel like the instructions are very self-explanatory but let's let's see how it works so I'm gonna take some sprite and put it halfway into each of these containers everytime I don't close the sprite all the way it gets so flat in the morning and then I'd rather yells at me okay now we're gonna take some gummy bears and put them in all of them you could do a design but like anybody got time for that and just kind of drop them in oh oh yes okay wait there's one minute here okay and then I'm just gonna fill it up to the top so now you just put the tops on and put in the freezer I'd mind if I look too much natural again so now I just pop them for the freezer and then leave them in there until they freeze and then take them out and set up like a cool scene thing and then take your cool Instagram pictures because I have very high hopes that these are gonna work okay so I just took him out of the freezer I left them until they got fully frozen and I'm really excited to see how they turned out because so far I don't see any visible flaws so let's see how this works out I'm doing a purple one okay why does my life suck like why is my life for the less than sign okay so we're not gonna do purple in we're gonna go with the green oh that's so disappointing I can't even see the gummy bears it looks so like it like you know when you're driving there's like frost all over the windows and you can't see anything this is so disappointing like I don't know II think if I try to take a good picture of this it would work out like even if I look a professional photographer so the gummy bear popsicle you are Addie I don't I'm gonna put this back and pretend that this never happened click over here to see the infamous pizza cake and then click over here to see the fun fatty

welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace out and God bless Turkish work it [Music]", "gZTWR5_hXVo": "damn let me just squeeze on in here yep there we

space guys here he goes oh jesus oh that's whole that's this is the worst thing that could have happened i thought it was just like a space shuttle i didn't know it would blow up i wonder if the gummy bear being in it just kind of threw it all off maybe that rocket would have been fine if not for the gummy bear hold on i kind of want to see this now there we go we got to open the top first that makes sense now fire now fire come on why is it having such a hard time getting out of there is it constipated what's going on troon one way troon the other way i guess we'll true that way it just peeks out it's prairie dog and it won't go all the way up and then it blew up it's the worst worst missile ever all right well once this radiation goes away oh god it's killing me oh there we go hopefully nothing no funny business happens hopefully there's no zombie gummy bears or anything like that oh god oh geez he's got a sword look at this massive thing some some about his expression is

long it takes to kill this thing with this sword one hit it took one hit it took one hit to kill it and he couldn't do it they're not good at hand-to-hand combat or or anything of the sort they need

him god he's terrifying why why who made this god okay let's go ahead and put down um i don't know let's say one siren head ah there we go all right the siren heads loose on the gummy bears now i've got a really good feeling about this uh well actually no they're all right it seems like they're trying to get inside but the fat one's clogging it up oh he made it through okay um siren has just gone wild on him but he is taking a lot of damage they are shooting him that's good guys i think they might actually kill them and kill him as they retreat inside they're all going inside it's i don't know they just they they require shelter i suppose but they're gonna get him real close and then then nothing then nothing oh can he get inside it seems that he can't get inside let's go on in and see what it's like for them in here ah yes okay that's uh they just see a bunch of legs and hands coming through i think siren head can get in if i bring him around this way can he get in oh oh nope still can't still can't get in they're smart i'll give him that the gummy bears they came in here and it seems like they're making their own civilization now uh they've got they're setting up i bet they're getting tomorrow they're gonna have jobs the next day they'll have prostitution bet right that's just how it goes with intelligent beings such as gummy bears um hold on i'm gonna give them some people to rule over all right let's get some citizens in here oh they're shooting at them they're throwing grenades at the citizens they they weren't built for this they're they're kind of mindless i made them that way i took out their brains oh jeez oh no there's a lot going on in there now i really stirred the pot by putting those uh putting those people in there it's really not good there's gummy bears dying they're killing each other i think the gummy bears are afraid of the people they're afraid to be eaten they don't realize that the people they don't feel uh they're not they're actually not real people all right i'm gonna have to take out the siren ad them i'm gonna have to finish them off they really can't do it on their own you know this is wrapping itself up really nicely jesus oh god oh he ate their head but not their ears he didn't eat their ears because they they had already had a bite taken out of their ears that's gross he only wanted the heads god what's what kind of sick freak just eats the heads off the gummy bears come on you got him big gummy bear you can do this okay you're weird ew what's going on with his stomach that's really gross get in there yeah big gummy

lot of battle wounds from uh from all this from whatever just happened um i think it just goes to show you things that uh the gummy bears aren't they're not very good in a fight you know give them a gun and they can they can stand on their own two feet for a little bit but eventually they're gonna be face down with their butt cheeks showing yeah i really don't know what else to say here all right

farmhouse on Boone comm and today my kiddos all four of the older ones not the baby are going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears so I've mentioned it before on this channel but my kids have

follow along with the crafts I'll link their channel below but today they're gonna show you how to make gummy bears with just juice gelatin and honey so what's great about this recipe is you can use healthy protein rich gelatin I will link the brand that I use below you can get it on thrive market which is where I get mine but you can also get on Amazon it uses grape juice or really you can use any type of juice that you want also if you want to make them something that is an immune booster for the winter season you could add the elderberry crystals that I talked about in my immune booster video so you can follow this exact same recipe but then just add several scoops of the elderberry crystals so that's another way you can add some superfoods into this and make them even more healthy [Music] [Music] first pour a cup of grape juice next pouring two tablespoons of honey [Music] dad your mom heat it up until just Underwood on your stove now we're gonna for 1/4 cup of gelatin into human journey while stirring you have to do so does nothing set make sure to pour it and very thoroughly [Music] now we're gonna put this mixture into our mold we use a dropper or funnel dropper

sugarfree gummy bears uh seem like an innocuous treat but if you'll check the Amazon reviews which we will they are actually more like super laxative so what turned these innocuous cute little gummy bears into um the diarrhea it's called maltitol blame maltitol which is a sugar alcohol it's why it can be sweet but not actually made of sugar is this what's we're seeing a lot in sugar-free like sodas and candies and it's a version of it you know and and they specifically used it in this case and it basically messes with your digestive tract on the way down it kind of confusing because most of the time as sugars are going through your intestines they're getting taken out into your bloodstream right but these sugars stay inside your intestines and through this power of osmosis basically you're trying to it's a little complicated but basically the liquids are trying to equalize and get equal amount of this of the sugar on both sides so all the liquids flood into your intestines and then they need to go somewhere so they uh they exit and which is really cool it's really unfortunate what this deli it's really unfortunate for the people who have eaten too many gummy bears but the fact that this was this was initially meant to be you know a good thing you want less sugar and less sugar is in some ways a good thing but it's sitting there in your stomach cuz your saliva hasn't broken it down and it's forcing all this extra water into your sort of digestive system and that's how you get diarrhea too much water in your digestive system so these reviews are out of control if you want to read them there are hundreds if not maybe a thousand what's weirdest made they vary between being five stars and one star because on one hand it's a great cleanse y'all on the other hand oh my god there's one I have here let's see I'm just gonna skip right to the juicy part Jimmy no pun intended okay a little intended what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a cop straw I swear oh my god I'm gonna skip that line 100% liquid flammable liquid napalm and it went on for hours I had five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasting hell bear so I told my friend about what happened to me and thinking it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings a graphic description she decided to take her chances take them off silly woman all the same for her and a phone call from her while on the toy you telling me shed wish she had listened I think she she probably was crying yes so much of this is safe for a person if teen gummy bears 15 not five pounds so if you have more than 15 gummy bears like have like the safe dose is something like a third of a gram of maltitol per kilogram of your weight right so on average for the average adult it's 15 gummy bears for kids it's obviously less you think you can eat more because they're sugar-free but you need to eat less who eats 15 gummy bears gummy bears I usually like 25 or 30 I don't know you're twice as many as you awesome that's why I'm sticking to the sugar ones I'll take the sugar over the other but do you know what this reminds me of do you guys remember olestra the olena potato chips potato chips yeah Wow chip 20 years ago which kind of dating us yeah those wild potato chips were yeah those Doritos that basically it was this artificial fat called olestra and the idea was you don't get any fat but what it did was cause diarrhea really bad and they actually had to put a warning label on it saying this will cause loose stools and when you see those words together loose stools you just don't really feel in the mood for potato chips Oh on the plus side if you ever want to dress up like for Halloween as a sea cucumber all you have to do is eat a whole bunch of these and then like a sea cucumber you too can expel your entire insides it expels its guts out of its very own Ring of Fire so do you think the problem here is what's inherent with a lot of diet foods is like oh well if it's low I can eat more I think the problem is that scientific illiteracy basic you know nutritional illiteracy people need to know more about what they're putting in their bodies and and and some basics about how they work and sugar-free seems like a good sell and like I said sometimes it is a good sell especially if you're like diabetic um but you need to know how many you're eating it's not that you should stay away from sugarfree gummy bears oh I think you should always it's that if you're going to eat them you need to eat fewer than the amount that will make you turn into a sea cucumber this is a it's a dangerous path you walk my friend so I think the lesson here is either keep your portions of the control or avoid multi tall and that is why those gummy bears are the worst sight in hell bears diarrhea explosion what do you think let us know below in the comments oh god no and please make sure to subscribe", "vkcKRAfxGug": "hello everybody welcome back so today we are making a DIY giant gummy bear so I have been wanting to make one of these for ages and I finally found that coming barrel online which is like this hello if you want to pick it up and it's today we're making a raspberry flavored giant gummy bear this is so amazing I have also been a presence you turn this in at 285 cookie bear by sophie-anne vodka so guys mom like a big biggest Joel shot in the world anyway but let get started alright separate things first watch what I do is combine some jello powder and some gelatin in a pot you can use any flavor jello powder that you like I use raspberry but again it is totally up to you then you want to add some water and let it sit for five minutes for the gelatin to develop then you want to set the pot to medium low heat and stir it until the gelatin is fully melted and it's just like at night and melt to a liquid in your pot then place that go your mold on a flat tray or a baking sheet and for the mixture into the mold and I carefully transfer this to the fridge do you want to chill it overnight orange soda can we make sure it has please set and it does set quite firmly so you want the luggage cream clean whatever but you want to set it until it basically has an ogive to it when you push down on it ends up feeling pretty firm when it then does I'm hopefully better onto your work surface and you can eat it like that or actually the kid I bought comes with these cute little bags so if you want really cute like placeholder for parties or like a little loot bag or something this is so cool in the little twist type I just like so yeah I hope you like this video on down below if you'd like me to show you how to make a sour version because I think that's how we're building bears

origami video", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of the gummy bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you

[ __ ] - hi I don't like being out of my house when I'm this I I don't know about you guys but that's just me I'm probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day definitely do not take all that at one time I would say like what I'm feeling right now you guys is more of a body high more than anything you guys love the most intense crazy body high right now feels like when you're coming up on psychedelics it's just intense I don't know if

why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I

help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this

falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so

this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody",

them i can go ahead and tell you that now because when i was eating the gummy bear ones i was craving those so which one do you like better i know you're good you like the gummy bears yeah all right so i'm gonna go ahead and get the ranking starting this wins one gummy bears second oh sorry you don't slam stuff down sorry about that actually uh slam that down no nowhere you know everything anyways gummy bear second this first the hell is that no there's a bee all right hang on let me get her pulled up choose your own website yep how do you think i buy these all right here we are all right uh no i wanna shop yes here we go okay so all right this was first gummy bears was second skittles was third oh damn i haven't tried those and i haven't tried those gummy okay gummy bears with second okay there's two more on here that i haven't had yet all right but here goes the list okay and i'm gonna do the ones that i've already had these the water watermelon straws come in first the gummy bears come in second the skittles come in third and then because i haven't tried the other two the fruit roll-ups is in fourth and in fifth and i'm sorry to do this to you guys was the gushers the gushers was absolutely and disgusting and i'm not saying that because it was bad candy i've hated gushers all my life and i thought it would take i thought it would taste like chamoy and i was so excited to get it because everyone was saying how it was the greatest and stuff or at least my sister was and and you know i was like okay like you know i'm going to try it all that stuff tasted like gushers you got a little bit of a hint of chamoy and when you got that chamois taste it was really good to me but when it tasted like straight up gushers nah nah nah i hate it i hated gushers all my life i'm not a fan of gushers all right whenever you're ready we'll go cause we gotta go over there before my dad goes to bed but this ends our hair i didn't stop eating i told you guys i'm gonna start craving these i like the gummy bears so if you don't finish the gummy bears i'll take them you're gonna help me eat them okay i like the cookie bears i like the gummy bears too i like the gummy bears a lot yeah the gushers she's got gushers skittles watermelons straws i didn't care for the fruit rolo sour patch have you tried the sour patch sour patch yeah sour patch what the waters let me see no i haven't because because every time i went on there to go buy it it was out of stock sour belts pineapple rings i bet those would be good i want to i've already tried the pine the pineapple rings before with which way on them but i definitely would be willing to get hers and try them for you guys but i think the next round absolutely what only got three more to go before i tried everything in her store and then at the end of that video just like i did at the end of this one i'll be ranking all the candy because that time i'll i have actually tried it every day okay i like it you you get the gummy bear taste but you also get the chamoy taste no the watermelon is watermelons one and gummy bears are my second favorite give me one i'm telling you right now you can't be eating all these i you know just like the noodles how we crave them i may end up doing that with these two what noodle them right noodles the ones from the asian market that we end up craving i get mine from kroger yeah well she doesn't grab him i do but that's the same thing that's going to happen with those i really thought you wouldn't like those because those are sour as a mom is that why you didn't like them was they too sour for you i like them oh you do like them yeah these are my these are my favorite these are my second favorite and uh skittles are my third and then next round i gotta get the peach rings i gotta get the sour patch kids and i got to get the something belt sour belt are you sure i did get this oh yeah that was like the first round that you bought me so i don't have to get the sour patch kids i just have to get the peach ones in the um sour belts how do you know we haven't tried the peach or the sour belts yet nah the gushers was nasty no the gushers was nasty and like i told them it had nothing to do with hers i just hate gushers overall i've never liked them even when i was a kid i actually preferred fruit roll-ups over gushers when i was younger but to be honest i didn't like either one that's why they're all the way at the bottom of my ranking and i'll probably stay there after i try the other two too because i've never i've never really been a big fan of fruit robots or gushers all right come over here we all want to see your reaction when you eat this i didn't have a reaction to it come here stand behind me stand behind me get behind mom they can't see you [Applause] behind you the sun no not directly behind me like screwed over this way a little bit i didn't really have a reaction yeah there you go oh see look what you did you might want to pick that up scoot that down we're gonna know come santa honey here take the baby all right here we go these are sour how do you not have a reaction to them well i don't but they're sour not really really i find these a lot sour they're already sour as is the the punches to be honest i'm really not surprised that these are my favorite because i've always loved sour punch straws i never i never got the watermelon one i i don't think i ever remember singing the watermelon one we always got the red and the green and the blue ones yes but to be honest these are my favorite i wish she'd start telling those sour pound straws with that on there they definitely try that because i like the watermelon flavor and everything but my favorite was either a tie between the red or the blue so if she put red or blue on there which one oh man all right i really gotta stop doing that my throat hurts as is but yeah oh my throat hurts as is and then drinking that hot sauce which makes it ten times worse all right anyways guys i hope you enjoyed this video if you did make sure you hit it with a thumbs up if you haven't already please subscribe to my youtube channel i got plenty more content

so it's actually pretty good I'm drink the gin gonna need some gelatin repackage whichever one rips the most is the one you take some sugar some food coloring and some measuring cups pots whatever main thing is some trays for your bears I want to give a shout out to mushiya I'm pretty cheap so she let me borrow them she got them from Amazon and she said she didn't do that great with them so I'm gonna see if I could degree with them okay so you take a cup of vodka make sure you wash your hands first smells great this out the way and pan hot whatever medium little heat it's gonna throw it back in hmm how were you gonna see that all right pull this out alright don't change my pot I hope I get him to click away I said it for Christmas girl don't we need that much this way so we don't put the sugar in it first I've got to bring over the wine okay forget that oh and the spatula a few moments later alright so the block is already sweetened so I'm not buying it that much it really doesn't need anything people can't handle vodka this is actually going to be my contribution for Thanksgiving so just just not crazy stir that in here until it dissolves I have the heat and medium low I didn't see that already you don't want to brown off the you don't want to bear it off the docket okay don't want to burn off the alcohol one packet series packet o3d packet three packets and you gonna stir you want to stir it before it becomes big I got it these nasty chunk you see this so I got this recipe from tipsy bartender they didn't mention how difficult it was working with this gelatin because soon as you put it in there it becomes a big chunk of gelatin I think one recipe online said to let it cool I'm gonna add some food coloring I'm not doing that I let it cool within the whole bottom of the job to make sure got really thick at the bottom those extraordinary doesn't match whatever chunks you see to mash it vodka probably should have been hotter but I'm not taking the chance like I'm taking the chance chumps ain't going away it's a good thing the bottom of this pot is scraped off a little bit because I could see the chunks better in those areas see that sweat chunk that you can't see them over there though use an old pack when you're making this JV tip they look good it does a little steam alright I'm not burning anymore this [ __ ] alright ah [ __ ] that all right back to my spot all right go ahead should I wait till it cools down just a little bit just a little bit I let it cool down all right time to open a row we have all right so since it's pineapple okay yeah okay so that tastes like yellow and a little bit of red all right all right all right I'm going to show you how many drops I use I'm not pulling out the phone again why does the yellow look red on we're gonna do one right now dan it looks like pineapple mmm kind of satisfied with that kind of satisfied with the one truck the yellow just one more yeah turns out right that's it yeah you know what no red no red okay that's crazy all right stir stir stir mike tipsy bartender says we're just gonna sit this on a cellphone alright don't need that go back to the backup all right so I'm gonna use this as a poor okay look at that nice pissy over my family's gonna love this get it all in there yeah that's good all right it's a lot easier when you have a pan because this moves you pick it up

pores with some water or something okay beautiful don't have to fill it all the way to the top like I'm doing I don't take it easy [Music] as you can see my turkey is done look at that look at that look at that sit apiece hmm well let's get back to what matters all right it's probably been about an hour you don't have to wait two or three hours that ridiculous ol put these in right we're gonna

the people\nthat are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are.

(laughing) That's my final thought. - Yeah, are we allowed to eat more? - We are here to taste\ntest some different gummies and the alcohol that it\nmay or may not taste like. - I like gummy candy, because it is delicious, and it's the best kind of candy. - Candy with alcohol, I think, is just genius. - Everyone needs a little bit\nof drinking during the day to get them through it, and might as well try it with the gummies. - I'm hoping that these are more sugary than alcoholic, that they\nhave a whisper of alcohol. - Are you ready to try the candies? - I'm ready. - Okay, let's do it. (jazz music) - That is very sugary. - I can take the bourbon.\n- Mm-hmm. - But --\n- That's not bad. - How many do you need\nto have a shot of this? - Cheers.\n- Yup, cheers. - Mm-mm. I'm done, nope. - Ooh, man.\n- Gummy bears. - I'm gonna chase it with a gummy bear. - Uh-huh.\n- Is that okay? - These gummy bears are more of a treat for me to have during the day at work.

Cheers. - Yes.\n- Mm-mm-mm-mm. - Tequila with a gummy chaser, yup. - It's closer than the bourbon was. - If they turned this\nflavor into a margarita, I would drink that real fast.

they're tiny I know I know go down master like when you guys know I need my good luck for my gummy videos let's try and a 200,000 thumbs up you've been killing it lately so I know let's get started so today I'm back with not only myself I know I'm the dummy god but I don't just Beth combine the camera so obviously we're gonna need some gelatin okay guys and you guys know I go hard on the gelatin so I got some gelatin bro are you serious am i serious about what - hey sugar flavor what it's a boy stuff this is possibly gonna be the biggest DIY I've ever done so basically you know I would explain everything I got but I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing so we're gonna figure out what we're doing as we go through the video basically what is in a Big Mac is there's bun meat lettuce pickles okay I'm not doing pickles but we got cheese more button more meat and fries so I got this mode for the top of the bun this mold for the bottom of the bun I got wolves for cheese I got wolves for tomato because you know you can't miss out on the tomato on a [ __ ] burger okay Big Mac I need to add tomatoes your burger you don't even like tomatoes I don't like tomato but everyone likes Tomatoes except for me I [ __ ] hate to me but I'd love to me exactly the Big Mac these Tomatoes we got molds for the patties we got moves for more patty we got molds for the middle one and we got normal for the lettuce and last but not least I got some primal picked up every [ __ ] morning all right this better be enough if not I'm really gonna be disappointed okay I don't want like in the story but you guys know how to make gelatin I don't know how to do it cuz I failed all my gelatin DIYs but Dustin knows how to make it so first step is to warm up what's first up water water big pot Brown cupboard that covers that cover right here okay I definitely lived in this house for a long time another one so everyone knows I'm the king of measuring on my channel obviously I always like to measure my stuff we're gonna measure half of a quarter of a Richter scale okay following along you're not I mean you gotta clean this bird but Richter scale measured me all you man circle shape and that's I'm pretty sure that just equals out to one of those folds now you need the hexagon oval oval shape and then just do it so let's fill it up guys and obviously you know what I'm filling it out there's this way you can do it but there's also this way so what I like to do is sometimes have a little fun with my camera mom just come in are you serious okay so we got one but it'd be the same technique with the second row this sprays too much mom come here for a second I need you to walk under this you don't want to come here so what you're boiling water guys it's a common misconception everybody think mom does wrong it off put it to medium-high and then to the little guys because we'd like to be productive on my channel in the meantime we are gonna be making this McDonald's fry box and my mom's actually gonna be making it I bought some [ __ ] marker to do the shading so mom when you can't make something yourself guys you got to get your arts and crafts mom basically if you want to make anything into the magic shape anybody watch Wizards of Waverly Place cuz I [ __ ] did I love that show okay I don't know if you guys know but Justin Bieber got his instagram back so you're gonna be like Justin Bieber got a finger back touch it in a [ __ ] turn into a fry box let's do this you do it I don't know what I'm doing recipe right yeah you gotta commit to it we'll do it together three two one Justin Bieber guts fry box just like that there's nothing over here you need to worry about nothing over my dad look we're gonna do the end on this box I know it looks better with an Emmy my mom drew this and that's definitely not this do the comparison this looks like Whoopi and this looks like a Ryan's reason not to mention it might not fit on the box guys the box is so blessed so let's go through the GI Bill I bet Raghu lon Eli beeline so as you guys can see the pot is steaming hot right now we're gonna put half the band in each pot like so and it's already starting to solidify oh we're supposed to whisk it this is the small way where's the biz Rick it's not apologetic you can never have too much gelatin I don't know if your science teacher told you otherwise they were wrong wolf he's always right [Music] now that the gelatin is a bit warm we're gonna put the sugar into so we're gonna use half of it in this one this is enough to give you instant diabetes so what is high laid everything out on the table guys we are gonna have to fill all of that up with do you like be alive heal I'm feeling the rest of the gelatin is going in this one and you have to whisk it right away otherwise it will get higher the amount of gelatin I got could feed six hundred families you know throw the bacon and we're gonna pour it into each of the mold so we're gonna start with the buttons tell me that doesn't smell yeah [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] okay we got the top button now the bottom button so now that the top and bottom funds are good we're gonna grab the middle one oh my god that's uncontrollable it's leaking every why is the price old brown so when you [ __ ] up guys don't worry we're recovering I did that on purpose guys I'm gonna teach you guys what happens when you [ __ ] up we're gonna pour this into this well just a nice yellow fry like so there we go so while that gelatin is cooking I'm just gonna add some food coloring in each thing fries need to be extra yellow so I'm putting a lot of yellow food coloring just to make sure they stay golden yellow crispy McDonald's fries you know how they are I also got a little bit of icing coloring but this stuff is super saturated super concentrated you don't want to use too much of this otherwise it'll turn oh I forgot to tell you about that your stained that's it no no no 100% staying for a week oh my god my fingers are now tinted yellow forever it's gonna put a little bit of that something okay guys we got the brown icing sugar I'm not saying my finger Brown I don't want you did you [ __ ] him wave your eyes it does not clean it we got to be very careful with the brown guys oh I said I'm talking about okay got my strawberry flavoring we're just gonna be flavoring the patty strawberries super strong yeah it's super strong okay so you use it all right tuberous Robbie said to crush me oh it's all gone okay so for the button we're gonna do a little bit of pure lemon extract apparently it's not sour I don't believe it that's heat units our boat holy [ __ ] that's bad next one we're preparing the lettuce the tomatoes and the cheese we're going to need our pan dusting can you take the top off for me please I like that nice and oily there can never be too much oil there as if you actually made that we're gonna be making the lettuce you want the legs to be nice and crinkly oh that's a good idea where he's pulling it through the door how is he still pulling it so like I was saying guys we're just gonna need about this bigger piece for this okay we need this lettuce shape number one BAM that's that romaine right there that's that good [ __ ] she's a little bit of orange oh that's nice that's what I'm talking well that's that expensive cheddar cheese that you get from the gums actually dogs are not about expensive stuff quality it's quality you know it's part to be pleased so for the tomatoes we have red food coloring and red icing color we're gonna use the food coloring because we don't want it to be too red three dots of that should be good enough those are nice tomatoes those are really nice no you would not so basically now all we have to do is leave all these to cool down for like the next eight to ten hours but I'm just gonna leave them overnight for a full day so I can make sure they solidified and I will be back when they freeze tomorrow all right guys day two we are back everything should be gummy let's go to the washroom and check it out as you can see you guys I told I'm gonna put a sign do not enter a gummy inside so that's how you know shit's important yeah so here's what we got it smells [ __ ] absolutely delicious actually let's see how one thing is that's [ __ ] gummy it doesn't even look fully gummy but that is way more successful than I thought so now what we're gonna do is bring everything out to the table and make the DIY biggest gummy burger McDonald's Big Mac burger in existence I don't want any of you guys telling me I'm not the goat I'm the DIY gummy goo right and I got check this out this is like some thin plastic looking material the buns are nice tomato and ketchup are nice we're gonna start with the fried okay so Dustin's working on taking out the fries we're gonna take them out and then put them on a cutting board and cut them after that's the way it's gonna go they just can't break on us if they break up this it's about to [ __ ] swing down and smoke you in the head yeah anyways like I say hopefully they don't break on us please gummy just come out in one piece I need everyone to smash that like button right now if one thing breaks then basically were [ __ ] so give me all the good luck guys I'm not good with gummies you know I fail all the time let's plop this over and see what this bad boy is saying three two one no nothing it's not coming out this is not good right now oh it's coming it's coming it's coming when you just suction it's gonna break let's go look at these McDonald's fries just finishing up on the fries guys we hold the knife so it is just gliding in like butter this fry is a little broken by the neck but we're gonna try and MacGyver a way to fix this but at least these fries are flawless so in order to get the fries to stand up we need to have a backing behind them otherwise they're just gonna snap off so we're gonna use wrist the board that I got but the thing about this is I wrap the tape around it thinking it was a good like life hack but it's now stuck I pull it and my mom gets pulled with it we're pulling the wrong way we got it off okay so now we are starting with the bird the first thing we need is the bottom of the bun three two one oh let's go okay so the next thing on a Big Mac if we look at this cheese we're gonna put on some cheese nice lay it on so that it hangs off the front oh my gosh delicious next is the Patty three two one oh yeah look at this concentration guys it needs a magic Wolfie top that is a patty if I've ever seen one that looks beautiful the cheese on the front of patty god damn what is next on this boiler oh yeah dehydrated drop cake okay we gotta be strategic with how we place these now we need to go a little bit to the left because it's tilting a bit to the right more cheese align it with the other cheese some lettuce because you know diet Wolfie is still alive and well so here we go let's go let us look at that so I'm over here too even though the weight will do Tomatoes next quick little yay whoa Oh tomato god this is just getting more unstable by the second yeah yeah I'm really scared we are limited on time all that's under the patty we have another yeah but the Patty's supposed to go under the tomato you have a Big Mac right there how did you yeah the party goes on top really patty goes on top confirm that it's the last thing the hell is Hattie bun Big Macs also don't have tomatoes do they don't but my Big Macs I've tomato this cannot breathe hi this is it too many I say we go over there right a bit there's a good balance drop panicky the ketchup does not want to move ketchup done three two one will expand kick the table world [Music] yes we're just taking the thumbnail but the burger is starting to crack my mom is behind me and trip me it's all good take the fries away this is way behind the scenes overthrown there looks like behind you the fries in front of the price where the burgers don't panic you're good you're good 100% you can you see my mom my right arm is numb I'm taking that time now bro it looks beautiful though it looks good it looks great Oh still looking great all covered so guys check it out basically we have the fries these are definitely hard to like just keep up we have to put some support sticks inside each fry just to make sure they stand up but compared to regular McDonald's fries and the burger I mean there's not much else to say compared to a regular Big Mac anyways we're just gonna get a nice cut through the door any other nice burger I feel like once we start cutting it's okay it's not sharp enough you got a machete guys be very careful okay yeah good I'll give you a fried first yeah here's your fries I need to have a McDonald's try to compare it pretty good cuz I wanted I don't want to eat too much down there yeah it looks good oh my god it's not bad yeah take a slice people are you doing that's been said you would take a slicer boom got some nice slices I've ever seen one that's all you need neat ketchup you need tomato can't stands on me if you got a compare so that's a Big Mac those for real good the badge real quick it's all good right Barry actually what it's just so good oh my god so the white bunnies like 2d fruity then we put that in that that was actually blessed this one this one this one this one and I see this one this one and this one and this one are all [ __ ] there's literally only one layer that was edible I mean top layer just to be sure no that was bad I'm not no guys I guess there's only one way to clean it up guys oh look at

you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "JDbazWjashQ": "[Music] but mr. gummy princess toy review hybrids and princesses it's a team I bet the president's missus fans today we are back with another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of today's video maybe like more signs experiments give you a big thumbs up and subscribe bye remember this is fine", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "B7WXjXs8L7U": "oh hey everybody we have another fun activity today what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country"}
