{"AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick

get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh

router it's my modem because the internet says where the the motor or the router sees me stays connected [Music] the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three

had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what do you say got water on my laptop i'm gonna take another dab

didn't start getting back into comic books until i found them cape and cal they're they're good heroes in their own right forty-five percent of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause]

market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "QavXt9ntmR4": "[Music] we're live rosin history greetings greetings and welcome to the town house here in Venice give thanks to bud gasm over here for bringing us all together my name is Nick Atia of essential extracts I'm joined by Phil Salazar of soil grown solvent list we got some other family over here give thanks to everyone who's shown up and come out shown support and is here to talk to about the history of rosin we wanted to provide a little education and throw it back to some of the people that have been involved since day one that have got us to where we're at today so Phillip did you want to say a little something about yourself before we get started I'm just here to talk about the history of rosin I'm super excited about it I like where it's gone where it started and where we're pushing towards so I'm just stoked to talk about it I don't well I'm gonna break into it I love giving credit where credit's due and I'm extremely blessed to have been here from basically day one from when this term was coined basically so a lot of this started before Instagram and before Facebook we had a lot of underground forums and the forums were where a lot of us growers and hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge so there was this gentleman named confession compassion Co mph a s o n I believe yes h o n but I also you know his his name is out there freely his name is chadwick Bastardo and i really like to give credit to this gentleman because back in the day there were a few forums that that I was on along with this gentleman compassion and he was really the one who started using this term the term rosin has actually been around for centuries it's been around for a long time in the adhesive and in that world the adhesive world just for a gummy substance you know sermons to like violins yeah rosin that term has been around for a long time it really was brought into the cannabis industry when confession started utilizing a stainless steel bowl with the stainless steel spoon heating up that bowl heating up that spoon and literally mechanically pressing his bubble hash into that bowl and stirring it around and he started noticing this ring of oil on the outside of that bubble hash and he was like huh that's interesting there's this separation and so he started pulling that ring of oil with his dab or tool off of there and back then it was knife hits and he started taking that oil off and taking knife hits and noticing that there was a lot less residue and back then the term full melt clear dome FM CD was a very popular term for when we got bubble hash or water hash so good and so clean that it would bubble up and make these clear domes and basically burn to very little if not no residue it wasn't until Chadwick compassion actually started playing with this technology of utilizing hot stainless steel instruments and mechanically separating the oils from the waxes that he took this knife hit saw these clear domes and saw zero residue and I really want to say that that's where rosin started but at that time there was no way to make that technology commercialized or scalable you know a lot of people in this industry talked about how is it scalable how do you scale this technology and that's where a lot of things are going and so you know back then it was the hash makers treat rosin started spreading that term you know this is back I want to say 2005 maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the actual date but this is pre dabbing you know so back then it was the hash maker that got to keep that ring of oil for themselves you know rosin really wasn't able to get out to the masses until people like this gentleman came along and I want to talk and I want him to talk to you guys about what really pushed rosin to be scalable initially what was the term that you came up with and what were you doing well I think I called it like solving this hash sha sha something like that but the way it started I was just really really into making hash and you know all my melts and stuff and smoking it and then like it got to a point where I ran solo on what I had I didn't have any more of my harvest and I got solo on my melts I was like literally trying to smoke like four star three-and-a-half star like low-quality melt hash so and I have to give thanks to you because I remember seeing a tip on your page back then where I would take Milo my like my low-grade melts and put them between parchment I'd use a hair straightener just to thin it out and it actually helped I was able to get a better dab off low quality hash and you know I got tired of that and so I'm trying to remember like exactly but fast-forwarding you know past like flattening my hash out and like just dabbing it like that getting to the point where I'm running out of my dabs so something went off in my head I remember just thinking like back okay okay going back again okay I remember I messed up doing that I pressed it too hard not in the hair straightener and I see it would be real shiny on the outside and dry in the middle and I wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold it up do it again phone I used to do that like I'd fold it up like three times so it'd be nice and like homogenized a nice good melt off of a low-quality hash you know what I mean the best you'd get off of it so light bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking back I remember that shininess I remember the dry so I didn't have a hair straightener laying there this is the longest story possible of it but didn't have a hair straightener laying there so I actually took a chunk of hash between a piece of parchment shoved it up against the email with my finger and I'd try not to burn myself or burn the paper on the side of the coil and sure enough I pulled it off and there was oil like I was hoping that would happen very little not enough to dab so I kept doing it doing it doing it took me like five ten minutes to get one dab hit it and sure enough my father-in-law family was there nothing it melted to nothing and it we were just amazed so from there it would that's where it started that's where the Hat I would say that's where the rosin for me started you know it started by a mistake that came back to me later on as an idea and I took it from there you know and so I was I was pressing hash so it all started with hash for me no screen screen wasn't any part of it at all so I was making low quality rosin still could still small contaminants in it for the most part it melted to nothing and so I ran out of all my hash and we got to a point you know we're just smoking bud so Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I did the same oh and actually when I was pressing the hash my wife had come out and she brought me a hair straightener cuz I had been using her hair curler and so she swapped that out for me so boom I get back to the out of the hash now I'm at the weed I pressed a but I think it's like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I pressed it on the parchment and crazy amount of oil came out of it like three of us got a dab off of like a little half gram bud so we were just amazed and they just went non-stop from there like nights of just pressing out eighths taking like five six hours just to press out an eighth on a hair straightener and that's where it took off and really I think that's where are all of our light bulbs turned on because we're like that's where it's scalable this guy is pressing flowers you know because before we you know us hash makers we didn't want to press the best-quality hash you know we've we got amazing quality hash and we wanted to keep it as that you know we might have started playing with a hair straightener to press it so that we could dab it but we weren't anywhere in the mindset of actually removing that waxy cuticle until I feel like flour rosin came about in that term I really want to give credit to Phil over here because I think that's what changed game for a lot of people especially on the mast level because kids all over the world had flour it was a lot harder for them to come by amazing water hash but they had flour and they had a hair straightener and that's what change game at that time is when I really believe we're pushing towards you know safe extraction you know everybody wanted to make oil we're all dabbers you know and when at a time when when solvent list was scarce and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt it's just a disappointment it was hard to come by six star five star even good hash to even know what it was so I lost my thought that hash split right before [Music] but yeah going back to it you know we came from somewhere and I'm just gonna give you guys a little recap right now we came from somewhere where we were watching forums of this guy named compassion taking bubble hash and pushing it on some stainless steel bowl to then playing with hair straighteners to then pressing flour itself into flour rosin and now look look where we've come you know there's been so many different advances in technology since then this man helped put out one of the very first rosin presses on the market there's been so many other rosin presses since and the technology just keeps changing and evolving and you know it's it's I think it's thanks to the education that we started the open forum education style that can fashion was pushing it on originally that we've continued that trend of really pushing education to our peers to our community and it just continues to evolve into something that I had never even imagined I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in a hot barn and now we're actually separating THC their THC a you know on a scientific level really we're seeing 99.9% THC a without the use of any chemical solvent so it's really really really come a long way pickup everyone that's involved in that movement we can talk about you know where it's going now so are you guys familiar with some of the new consistencies that we're seeing out there how many show hands out there in the crowd how many of you guys have tried rosin just rosin alright so when we first started making rosin was really when the consistency of earwax was popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna bring it back to like 2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit the market pho was called earwax back then so as us hash makers started to make water hash on a more controlled level a higher level we wanted to mimic what was happening in the BHO world so this is pre rosin but we started making hash on a higher level where the hash was coming out gold rather than brown and it was coming out smelling really like the flour that it was come from because we were controlling the variables of the water the temperature of the water our environment that we were making the hash in and that starting material we started really really paying attention to the starting material rather than using stuff at uncle's farm that had been sitting on the side of the road that he didn't want on his property because that was more weight on his property that's what we were making bubble hash out of initially up in Mendocino Humboldt County we started making bubble hash out of close trim and not just the close term mixed with all the fan leaf and everything else they were throwing away then we started making water hash out of fresh frozen material you know I think 2008-2009 was when I first did my first wash with fresh frozen material and at this point we're making water hash with whole plant fresh frozen material later on we're gonna talk about some of the amazing magicians in the crowd over here that can make fire with dry trim it's been sitting around but right now you know the pinnacle of water hash is using whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping around a little bit here but throw it back to that 2008-2009 generation when earwax was popular we start learning a little bit more and then chatter becomes extremely popular 2009 Colorado California 2010 and Shatter is the consistency so we started wanting to recreate that consistency of shatter so we started heating up our hair straighteners a little bit hotter you know pressing in between parchment paper just our water hash at a higher temperature to create more stability more of a clear see-through shatter consistency and I think that's another one of the variables that pushed us as hash makers to find out what rosin was we wanted more stability we're trying to create these consist we were seeing in the BHO world but we weren't seeing as much stability if you just press hash at you know 200 250 degrees you're gonna see it turn into shatter but eventually you're gonna see it start to degrade turn darker butter up some of those issues and it wasn't until rosin came along and rosin the actual art of rosin is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle if you look at cannabis cannabis you know is a plant that has a lot of these shiny trichomes on the outside the crystals if you will all plants have different structures of these crystals and as hash makers and specifically rosin makers we're learning about this structure even more with every strain that we run some strains have that longer stalk with a very small head with a thick waxy cuticle and they may not run as well in water hash they may not press as well in rosin you start seeing some strains that have a thick stalk in a really bulbous head with a thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them run better in water hash you're seeing the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less and you're seeing higher yields higher potencies and so you know moving forward we started seeing these different consistencies like shatter like the ear wax and then as we move we started seeing this sauce consistency in the butane world where we were seeing a layer of terpenes on the outside and it's pushed us rosin makers to continue this movement and to continue trying to create a higher echelon for our industry by pushing education and I think we've taught each other at this point that we can now separate THC a via different temperatures and different pressures to pull those terpenes and pull those the THC a separate that and now as we see these saucy and jammy consistencies in the BHO world we've been playing with pressure just like butane hash oil is utilizing these columns basically to pull pressure and then keep the butane and the trichomes under pressure creating separation we're now seeing the same thing in the solvent list world some are calling it rosin jam some are calling it solvent list sauce but we're seeing these consistencies now via ultimately means and rosin so rosin history just continues as we see different consistencies as we see I feel like as we see now hydrocarbon guys starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and THC v that's all with pressure and columns and temperature and so I think as we continue that might be some of what we see in the future as far as what rosin can really do you don't need a column you don't need heavy chemicals you don't need to possibly bro up blow up your neighbor's house we're seeing all of these different consistencies via solving this means thanks to rosin through the use of heat pressure and force right on I think that really kind of concludes it do we have any questions from the audience or anything else anybody think that rosin is going in another direction anybody disagree what what we talked about as far as the history of rosin it's a trip how far we've come really this started what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the commercial market heavy I just actually came from cookies in Maywood and there was a ton of different rosin brands on the shelf and it was amazing to see it started 10 years ago but I'd say realistically it took off about five years ago when when the masses started to learn and do it themselves at home and the more Minds that are able to focus and work on it and share the knowledge that they find that's why I think that's why we've quickly evolved this technique you know compared to has been around forever and it's taken so long to get to where it is but you know with the butane extraction and with everybody hands-on trying to do you know learn two new techniques and do the next best thing with solvent lists or with rosin I think that's where we're breaking through and and I think you're right we're gonna find you know all these different components we're going to be able to separate you know we're already at the point where we're separating THC and fats and terpenes so I think we're there it's pretty crazy to see some of the hydrocarbon companies switching over to solving this you know that's that's where I feel like that's when we made it you know like this education really did something we got the guys that have been known for making butane making solvent list now that's one of the cool things you know as of January 1st 2019 a lot of the new regulations came into California and it was very difficult to just set up a closed-loop system get the fire department out there go through all those regulations people are able to get to the end goal of a concentrate and a nice healthy alternative right one regulations hit and some of the first companies to come to shelf were rosin companies or solving those companies because it was a little bit easier to get manufacturing going licensing for type six via type seven was a little bit easier to push through she didn't have to deal with the fire burn nearly as much still do but a lot of factors have really really changed game I feel like when we started putting solvent list products or water hash products on the shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market was water hash and at this point I think we're definitely pushing 20% of the concentrates especially in places like California and Colorado so big up ourselves appreciate all the support and keep pushing education for real that's what puts the products on the shelves that are healthy that's what puts the quality on the shelves and that's what helps the consumer understand what's good well I mean the perfect example is the diamonds you know we kind of touched on it but I'll back it up a little bit just in case anybody didn't catch that one but in the hydrocarbon world right when we learned about roz in a year or two into learning really about commercializing and scaling up the creation of rosin we started seeing the butane guys make diamonds and we're like oh we got to learn we got to step up our game over here we're on shadow right now you know we're starting to make this butter and these lighter consistencies but diamonds oh how do we make this in the lab how do we compete and really you know it was all in playing with different temperatures different pressures different separations I feel like the first diamonds were not actually grown we're now seeing on the solvent side of things growing diamonds with pressure but the first diamonds to come to the industry were actually mechanically separated amorphous solids morphus solid crystalline yeah and you know I was gonna bring it up a little earlier I might have touched on the gentleman but I have too big up a man named Jeff or the cannabis Reverend this revenue because of church Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of the first gentlemen to bring in the actual micron screen to separate the oils from the waxes or what we later found out to be a lot of that THC a you know so that bag not only contained a lot of the waxes but it also contained a lot of the THC a so eventually we learned that pressing at higher temperatures would completely remove the rest of the the terpenes and actually are a lot of the rest of the cannabinoids and at those higher temperatures we were just retaining THC a right and eventually we learned that that white powdery substance was the THC a that we are seeing some of these hydrocarbon companies put out we started testing some of those that white powdery substance and hitting anywhere from 94 to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed labs in Colorado and then we were like whoa how do we turn this white powder into what looks like the diamonds more heat and pressure so we brought the temperature right back up to around 250 degrees people do it at different temperatures but basically to melt that white powder back down into a solid form and then you can mold that that form into whatever shape you want I think when we first started doing it we were just making very very thick slabs so we started with the white powder we heated it up into these thicker slabs and we were smashing it in the lab and in our parchment paper and it was basically just making all different shapes and sizes of crystal and we started getting that tested and even with that slight temperature up crease upwards at 250 degrees we were not seeing any THC a turn into THC which was interesting and our labs were telling us that it was pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of the labs that we were using not to put anybody on blast some of the labs that we were using for giving us test results back at one one hundred and eight point four percent THC a so we had to step back and say okay we can't put this on the shelf that doesn't make any sense you can't have over a hundred percent what's happening here and we contacted the lab they're like well we've never seen anything that high you know what's going on and we started looking at the standards and you know this is gonna be an ongoing issue in newly regulated environments but one of the standards came from res Tech and there's another standard that's put out with another company there's a few more companies that are putting out cannabis standards now but res Tech Stander's range from like ninety seven to ninety eight point nine percent their THC a standard and when we turned in our THC a sample is higher than that so we bumped the scale and I feel like they have to create some new standards at this point but we started leveling it out the lab started learning and we were mechanically separating THC a so to get back to the original question mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you know it started with the earwax we created solvent less wax now the rosin has really really given us the advantage to recreate different consistencies we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we saw diamonds become instantly popular with butane extraction and propane extraction few other methods to create diamonds and we had to find a way so we utilized heat pressure and mechanical separation how much a did you throw away before you figured out that's the craziest thing yeah well luckily we were actually using a lot of it in other products topicals edibles and other things of that nature because we were seeing the test results in our coconut oil and other things but we just didn't put two and two together it's crazy to think back on it but yeah we definitely threw a lot away we definitely use some for purposes that we shouldn't have been using it for you know in mechanical separation I always like to talk about allocations and this is maybe something we can take a little break on but allocations are extremely important and that was one of those allocations we were throwing away something that had a lot of value another allocation I talked about is when we're especially when we're talking about butane versus solvent list I used the strain blue dream for the perfect example you get a full indoor operation of blue dream you bring it into your lab and you've got the hydrocarbon guys next door butane extract guys and they're yielding 18 to 24 percent on this blue dream you bring that same exact blue dream into the water hash lab we might be yielding three to five percent on that blue dream and originally I just started this discussion about the trichomes structure whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a longer trichome stalk but blue dream is one of those ones that has a long stalk a very small head and a thick waxy cuticle it does not yield well in water hash and this is just an example you may find the very specific cut that does do well in water hash but for general purposes aloft in times the blue dream that we see is just not good for allocating towards water hash it's great for hydro carbon and so the same thing goes with allocations on the back end we found that that white powdery substance that we were taking away in our bags and keeping the clean clear beautiful gold rosin you know we were throwing that away as Phil mentioned and we've now learned to allocate that and utilize that THCA that we're thrown away any other questions we got lit up here so I don't all right so we're used to you know the full spectrum like 45min 160th you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus for separation because you know I I found some light goods you know find some good heads in the ones bigger heads who beat our dicks have you guys tried explored that so you're saying you know do we basically isolate the 160-180 micron and you know press that out and see the quality of that rosin and do stuff like that or separate or keep it like yeah I mean personally yeah I've actually just recently I mean it was some indoor but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG which is to me not a common thing to find for ice water hash a 180 you and it was incredible it actually put out about 91% return on the rosin so it was the most most impressive 180 I've ever seen when he talked about that return on the rosies talking about the actual trichome head being pressed into rosin and when you're talking about a 91% return that means there's barely any waxy cuticle it means you're barely losing anything you start with 5 grams and you're yielding about four point two four point five or four point six grams now I'm horrible with mass start with the gram and you know you're getting 0.9 one bag there you go but but yeah I mean for the most part a lot of strains I do I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it really depends on your methods you know gentle agitation depending on strains and knowing what you're working with the environment you're working in and controlling all your variables I think the 180 and the 150 are really good because for the most part I usually isolate everything depending on what I'm doing but I find in the end a lot of things end up just making it into the same batch because what I'll do is I'll isolate and then you know I'll press everything out and I'll separate everything by quality you know so not quality just by color but call you by terpene profile always have to dab it taste I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is usually not my favorite I like to keep that little separate because I don't know if it's more fats and lipids that are in it that's giving it a certain taste but I mean it's still great oil but to me I think keeping the 40 separated is better than keeping the 180 and the 150 separated because to me the 180 and the 150 have a high terpene profile to me those have like my favorite terms you know like if you never catch 150 or 180 those are just man lucky and to really you know summarize that it's so strained dependent you know I was actually speaking of your og cush that you'll did amazing in your 180 bag we ran some lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a strain that was brought back by a soldier friend of ours that we ran in Colorado for a long time this one round that one of my growers grew wielded over two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag okay so anything's possible and to go back on what Phil said I really like to emphasize that we actually do the same thing we separate all of the microns I run a couple 220 bags we actually run a couple there and in the washing machine just to make sure we've gotten all that plant material I then run a 185 a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the hundred the 90 that you know sometimes to run a strain that we've never ran before I'll put all my bags in there I'll try and separate as many as I can because each strain each grower each medium is gonna be a little different even from one row you know you might be running the same strain in a grow house but have LEDs in one row have your HPS and another you're gonna see differences even there's differences from the top of your plant to the bottom of the plant as far as the trichome formation the amount of oils in them the size of the trichome head so we really like to especially when we're running a strain that we haven't run before is run all of those different micron sizes you can combine them in the end I can't combine them you know if you've started with only three three microns you can't separate them sorry beforehand so we like to start out with as many bags as we can see where the heads are lying and then eventually on that next run when you're running that same material from that same garden you can remove some bags you don't have to use all those bags and I think right there I think what that is in my opinion is every strain has a different head and tell you know so it's like the heads the cream and the tail is gonna be your butt end it might be it's lower quality you know but for the most part when you see the head and tail together like a full-spectrum hash oil something it's a good product but when you actually pull that tail end out of like let's just say for instance a headband we're running and that you know you can run seven eight spins you know 30-minute spins and you're still pulling and you know five spins in it was just quality but you can see it's getting darker more contaminants but then you get to the rosin and you're pressing everything out and everything's just coming out gold regardless of the hash you know and and you know it's all about the yield so you got a hundred grams of high-quality and 10 grams of just some darker oil other strains you know you'll notice regardless of the yield you might got the same yield off that strain as far as hash but it comes to pressing you know you have more wax membrane to those heads so therefore you're getting more more tail in with that head so you know you're get looking at like let's just say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail in because that's the darker oil yeah and that's that's more when you're looking for like when people are separating their Roslin's you know having like you know their their heads - and then just the edible grade for me I kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I kind of like to keep everything together as long I like to keep the tail end out and I think that's an important part of extraction is the head and tell regardless of what we're doing rosin ice water extraction ahead and tell it's all about knowing when to poll and what to keep separated a mature grower as anybody here ever explored with ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash like definitely actually we've yeah the question is has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning with hash or ultrasonic technology and we've used on actually a number of scales and people companies that I know right now are utilizing that technology in a number of ways as well I'll touch on a few things we had a company come in to our facility we were one of the first licensed facility blessed to be one of the first licensed facility in the world in Colorado and so a lot of companies from the cold brew industry from the wine industry beer industry started contacting us because we were able to do license protected R&D and an ultrasonic agitation company or cavitation company similar technology contacted us from the cold brew industry and brought in machinery into our facility and we started playing around with it unfortunately cannabis is a lot different than coffee and hops etc and we just kept having clogging issues with that machine but I saw value in it so what we did use utilize that cavitation or that ultrasonic technology not to separate the heads from the material like we initially wanted to and I still do think that there's value there and I think that there is viability and I think that you could do that but instead we ended up because it costs so much money for the machinery and to keep making these diodes bigger and these passageways bigger because the cannabis had to flow but we wanted to get an exact temperature there were a lot of variables that cost a lot millions of dollars really in R&D that this cavitation company didn't want to just keep shelling out but we ended up finding out that on a very high level turning up that cavitation device that ultrasonic device we're able to actually fully homogenize the oil into the solution so for edible products for topical products there's a lot of value in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I still do think there's value in separating the oil via this technology if you guys aren't familiar basically ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so intense that it can actually separate oil from wall they've used it in actually separating rivers and things of that nature on a larger scale ie cavitation but we saw this value because we started turning it up and actually breaking the trichome heads in water which would be our solution and now we have oil and water in one solution we started going back to okay how do they get oil out of water and you know we started playing with some of the technology that they're using in the oceans to get you know spills out of the oceans these polymer tubes basically that run on the bottom of the ocean that are pulling the oil out of the ocean and we played with that but we weren't seeing the yields we wanted to see I still do think that there's a lot to do there and there is a future for it so keep playing that's what it's all about I didn't get to it I didn't get there yet myself but I think one of y'all could share share share with everyone put it up on the forums throw it up on Instagram tag these guys they'll put it out there that's what it's about man that's what it's about we found each other somehow we found compassion both both of us found compassion so keep spreading knowledge for real and stick around today because I think we definitely have some more discussions a little roundtable with a few more hash makers in the building but we're gonna take a little split break I think right about now", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to

gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted

night crowd screaming as awesome when you that for the so that she - yeah well you make it cuffing individual yeah because it's such a small in my office it's not gonna really benefit us to use a whole yeah absolutely honestly I find it to be maybe even race well with the bag I'm such small out because so much gets trapped in their horror scenes and [ __ ] there's got in there mmm both often hey thanks for joining us is a live Robin to us today with star shining a total ban against which I agree yeah a presence in high grade this is brought a resin ranch GMO so right now he's preparing the bag yeah [Music] ten little rap on it screw this heavy really productive oh this is abstaining thinking to the truth [Music] just test the speed nicely the press is still have enough in the speed of the plate clothing there we go this is dupe I'm just gonna blow out if I'm not careful he's gonna put on a wrap and a small small amount when you get in there and see this [Music] back it off a

the light are you falling on Tosh late look go eliminate some time for Hannah oh well yeah yeah totally now you can see those little squares here I figured it was worth its buy the expensive what can i yeah bamm-bamm spaghetti land no it's all right cooled off a bit now collect it up no but you just do right off the bat just take that one gram you're talking about mm-hmm put it right over yeah off these rips that's a purest of the pure 100 scale you do what I say I have to do a second pressing not focusing on very well it tried to focus on it for a second yeah it goes in and out I got to figure out what it's focused thing is the giving it doesn't have it one that you can choose but I found it and that's perfect well it's so good that you're and yeah it's just serious oh yeah that's a good view of it you sure you just saying have smellivision order oh man oh wow the odor of this Rand Paul mouth dude whoo oh no oh my baby sure of it just like that that stage Nicholas pull that off a bit a little bit simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh oh there's still more yeah boom there you go that's like a dream well I'm curious because if but like it should be one third of the ratio just cuz this is gonna end up being like super small amount of diamonds who want to get a fatty amount or like an even ratio or some Island right now what bank with some some good amount so it's like a pretty deep sea some diamonds and then like even it might be less than I have a grandma last time today know why empresa nice oh there you go oh well then gold out then some ranch farmers and definitely farming that resident whether that's fire two grams that's pretty good there was what was it on the way through 70 yeah that's two point seven half that's like stir-crazy out Jesus 77% whopping their services in Wildman oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I guess would be one still do this one again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it up right now yeah so yeah we got Graham to make the goods out of those may not be the better yet okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly you know one young put these into this much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be all right calculated okay so I'm really anxious to fight at this stuff yeah [Music] oh gosh here's a little trick associated to one if you lock your fingers you just take the glove off your finger [Music] yeah pretty honking way back [Music] hit honestly though we don't look that much better than his hash I mean I said there's more definition Oh Barry speaking yeah now watch week watching the watch walking with the [ __ ] oh okay there was very much done with him really [ __ ] activated now the bird about ten minutes oh really right there I thought yeah yeah that's literally the most gorgeous [ __ ] time the second squish real quick here 180 degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all that in just one blow real oh I figured this would have to go hi yeah but maybe we should have no such is who fear why rural Oh so he said why do you whip it for consistency people are commenting hell yeah well size micron byesies I believe we're using 25 right well I'm not sure what size micron bags of the hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149 there you go I know that and then yeah my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is a little lower than you really need to go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual but this stuff is really I just makes it really clean and then it's also double usable uh EE used as the thing that we wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA extract out of it the [ __ ] daddy so thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon it does it just kind of kicks in the nucleation process which helps to cause it to butter or change consistencies which you need it to be in that kind of tacky ER consistency or less less messy before you can actually make it into the THC a effectively otherwise most of it was booze out of the bag this one was on with right this is what the first grand that we didn't live yet this is the second ground that you whipped on camera and writing it so you can see the difference between the two clearly this one was just whipped for it you know a little while that one it was not whipped at all looks beautiful says hell yeah focus three people in the house now yeah those look [ __ ] beautiful thank you sir sup neighbors so these guys following Instagram resin ranch extraction yeah they know what they're doing yeah this is hella dense split in the house starting yeah gotta know they're easier than love well my limiting factors are out of my hands you know if people are knowing the product and they're isolating it clean methods then most pretty much just skate by on this end serious you know thank you John 4411 thank you very much this is donated lemon start out Thank You Man that's [ __ ] awesome when life gives you lemons you squish them muhfuckas into some dank but yet so one form this is kind of a nice little squarish shape book yeah and get it butter in the form that we want to wrap it in the final bag well that's the wait until the father to do that but you can get that shape oh dude Thank You lab max flashier than that [ __ ] yeah bro just enabling this little infants of it yeah well we gonna have some lemonade oh that is that fresh hmm gonna get myself a second time remember it's still beautiful color oh wow yeah it's still clear yeah how are you playing oh my god yeah I get the time yeah yeah whoo garlic comes out in 2021 I guess forget that so what'd you guys think can unicorn swim - or just fly the thoughts was a rosin master as the rosin teenage ones are the thoughts that keep you up at night yeah I mean obviously they can breathe in outer space but so that yeah of course they can swim in cool BAM there's the second press meat usually makes it a darker color but it's still yeah it's totally fun that's the same way oh my god we ready to go try to have with that yeah as I was thinking yeah [ __ ] yeah I know if we can just shut this down now

video is intended for people over the age of 18. so if you're not over 18 just do me a solid head out for me and if you are over 18 do not try this at home all right what's up welcome to smoking stuff that you can't today we're gonna smoke some hash rosin in a little snow globe so let's [ __ ] get it man big cheers pinkie's up everybody [Music] [Music] oh my god all right but yeah in all seriousness we are smoking on some hash rosin today i just kind of wanted to you know [ __ ] chill and smoke and just get really hot we picked up some nice flavors from colorado and so now we're gonna just [ __ ] chime on just talk about it and um yeah i kind of want to put you guys on if you don't know what the [ __ ] colorado's about with the [ __ ] hash bro colorado the best hash rosin at the best price you know what it means of like laser cat some of you may know them some of you may not they make some good [ __ ] they make some [ __ ] good [ __ ] you know and i know of a plug selling that's it like the same here for a hundred a gram and they were selling this at the dispensary i think out the door was like 55 after tax and everything what bro like hash rosin for 55 gram i know people here trying to sell shatter for like 50 grams and that's honestly i feel like only because you're getting it like it's made in colorado like if you're getting laser cat in like not in colorado you're gonna be paying a little bit of an extra tax because you got to think about it you got to pay for the [ __ ] because the person that buys it from colorado to whatever state needs to like pay like a little bit right and there and then when they sell it to somebody they're going to want to have to pay for the cost of the shipping and buying it from the person because they want to make money like someone buys it from them at a higher cost and then let's say your plug buys it from that guy at a higher cost and you're getting it for three thousand dollars a room let's get on to the concentrates we've got [ __ ] four flavors so yeah let's get into it this one first one from leafa leaf concentrate it's also this is these guys are also from colorado um i got puntang pie it's my favorite kind of turps too it's the fruit ones bro like the any any fruit like papaya cake because that's like that's cakey and fruity but citrus stuff like a lot of sativas like clementine lemon the best flavor for me at least um oh you guys have not seen this one oh yeah we can get this going ooh you guys haven't seen this piece it was a gift i got for my birthday from a homie big thank you and um yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] rips in if you go back and watch the california video this piece is just a bigger version of the piece that we had in california oh [ __ ] perfect him let me get the right angle a little too low temp but oh you can't go wrong with a little bit of a reheat for those of you asking like why why why is this [ __ ] always [ __ ] ticketed so high like why is it so why is the hashrats and so taxed briefly it what it's because of what it's made out of if you take like a good ass nug right and you look at it you put your flashlight on it a lot of people look for that little sparkly white [ __ ] that's on the on the bud that sparkly white [ __ ] when you zoom in on them it's called they're little clear balls and they're called trichome heads and it's basically everything that you want in the plant it has all the flavor all the thc and everything so what people do is that they take a freshly grown plant they freeze that [ __ ] and after it's being frozen for however long a bunch of nugs into a big ass tub filled with ice water take a stick and they stir that [ __ ] and through that stirring process and that filtration process all of those white heads are [ __ ] filtered out and you get like a pile of sand looking [ __ ] and that's all those little trichome balls and that shit's called hash and then you take the hash and you press into like a brick and then you put it between two hot plates you squish it and it's the juices of the [ __ ] trichome bed now you're probably thinking that because they use the trichome heads as their base to extract these [ __ ] juices and this uh rosin from it you probably want to assume that it has like 95 thc some crazy amount of thc gets you so [ __ ] high but in reality no i don't know if you can yeah so i don't know if you can see this is only 64 thc i think the amount of thc or thc percentage is honestly overrated it all depends on what terpenes are in the plant and how they affect your body because you can have some bud 18 thc and it has a lot of mercy in it which is the terpene and weed that makes you relaxed makes you feel like chill you might have a lot of that and so when you smoke it you're like super like mellowed out you're just like damn my [ __ ] i am right now so i think you can smoke an eighth that's like 31 thc and it's just like all right yeah like i'm high but like you know it doesn't give you that same like holy [ __ ] feeling you know so next up we got that papaya cake from laser cat a very well known brand and uh you're a connoisseur you definitely know who they are bro the smell on this [ __ ] is [ __ ] insane but that's another thing too like with a lot of the extra terpenes in there you get a lot more flavor it's a lot tastier a lot smoother look at this [ __ ] [ __ ] where's the cafe oh i got this new carp cap and it's the same one that i got my homie for his birthday the one that i got him fit all my bangers perfectly and it was fired that's why i wanted it and so i get this one and look look at that [ __ ] it doesn't even fit all the [ __ ] way that's worse on this banger like it still works the ball there's still like a seal enough for the ball to spin and [ __ ] but you know promise like this shit's like super like see that thing just breaks off not good enough maybe a little more oh yeah this is going to be super tasty [Music] oh watch this all right yes i'm highs i am as high as i look and i'm not ready to keep filming but we're going to keep filming this [ __ ] doesn't have any labels on it it's from true leaf it's a local dispensary here in florida and they've they're probably the best dispenser in florida i can't cap because they have just everything they have rosin but this is flower rosin so that whole process of like that whole extracting the trichomes and everything that doesn't go into this you just take the weed that you grew and you just press it all right it's a lot it's like a lot less steps right but this [ __ ] is still tacks i i don't really like to scoop from the middle i'm just looking at the camera is that good oh [ __ ] bro that's fat as [ __ ] hmm i think he's up [Music] all i look sober you get like the tingles right like i feel it my fingertips and my nipples we got another graham from laser cat and we uh we had to scoop up some gmo because we're [ __ ] nasty i think we're about to do something fancy for this one you guys remember this from the last video [ __ ] glare oh bam there's an insert in there and this insert kind of sucks to be honest because it's like a boo boo boo ass china one but what it is good for is cold starts so we're about to cold start this whole so you take your concentrate put that [ __ ] on scoop it up like some ice cream and drop it in there oh yep you carved a [ __ ] and then you just toast here [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] closed captioning not available [Music] okay all right i'm done thank you guys for watching the video um hopefully the next time i see you will be a wednesday maybe this one's a wednesday i don't know i hope it is maybe it is maybe just i don't know i'll see [Music]", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live

gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it

them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "MiaJTRLYTHY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] yeah we back at it let's go can't nobody hold me down how did you gopro [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] so oh the temperature down in the room right now so this is going to be very [Music] workable [Music] so [Music] i'll get it there [Music] [Music] do [Music] fire oh yeah let's get it [Music] [Music] so once your gloves warm up it's time to swap gloves [Music] i've been doing that to everybody i hop on their live stream and the first thing i say is daddy is here i don't care who it is i did it to me sonic i did it to [ __ ] uh pedro this morning i did it to josh last week [Music] remember it's not the twist it's the stretch that's my treat that's the secret you guys it has nothing to do with the twist the twist is just an easy way to stretch it it's the stretch though that's all it's about oh and that's the end of that i'm gonna start snapping on you [Music] actually not if i find that right now i'm gonna dab that [Music] i said nothing imagine taking the whole thing i mean you could just depends on where you want to take it [Music] [Music] so [Music] flew over by the rig oh no it's gone it's gone that little tiny piece is gone then because it ain't there it's all good it's like the tiniest little [ __ ] piece [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] me hmm hey not bad for a little 25 160. i haven't make one of these in a while now let's see what we uh we got yield wise right i'm curious are you curious i'm curious hello 0.0 grams 11.1 out of 17.7 nope it went down to 11. so we got 11 grams out of 17.7 that's a 62 percent return on the 25 and 160. not bad at all it's not bad at all hambone how do you want this you want this in some jars you want to do some parchment you want in some ptfe what's up what's up what's up tell me how you want it i feel like i should shove it into a couple of jars but right now i'm going to take a dab roni so beautiful [Music] break me off a piece of that [Music] oh i think that's a good enough dab i'm sorry hambone i had to do it don't get mad at me bro [Music] come on i love your dog but i'm about to dab it [ __ ] out of this i don't care how much it is i'm gonna store this here for now i'm sure i'll be back later how many different jars do you want that's what you got to tell me i don't know how many jars you want it's it's 11 grams so i can split it up into however many you want all right i'm sorry i'm gonna have to sit down for this this is a this is a a boy sit down it's like a dab this is the type of dab you take standing up and it's gonna tell you shut the [ __ ] down boy what's wrong with you all right [Music] coffee going and i found a little [Music] thca chunk to throw on there [Music] death [Music] step by dab i'm gonna give you some some [ __ ] love on instagram right now [Music] now bone garden that killer collab that y'all never saw coming what's up athena alex back burner what's up let's get it just pressed up a little bit of that hambone gardens this is the 25 and 160. yo yo yo this is the hambone gardens 25 and 160 right here hopefully you can hear me now that i turn the music down let's get it fatal tester dab we don't take no baby [ __ ] dabs around here oh yeah oh yeah i don't want to miss this one hmm jesus take the wheel um hmm oh yeah don't sleep on it that was the 25 and 160 let's go oh my god that felt like i was smoking some of my own [ __ ] ham bone you did it again you know what i like about hambone the first thing he told me i don't care about quantity i care about quality don't go for yield go for the high quality bet money homie that's what i like to hear [ __ ] me my bad i knocked you guys over that's what i like to hear my farmers say because if they're going for yield they know the quality is not good but if they know the quality is good they don't want you to go for yield keep the quality good oh my god yes sir that was like smoking on some of my own homegrown gave me the dab sweats it was smooth the entire time it cleans up extremely easy regardless of how big the dab was i mean hard to tell it is it's clean in there man it's nice so holy oh dab switch my turf caves are [ __ ] running but it's time to get into the full spec presses we're gonna fold up some parchment real fast for that and then have at it man good yes good dab good good good dab probably a little bit bigger than i should have gone for this early in the morning considering i still have work to do man [ __ ] turd caves sweating holding [ __ ] devil's ball sack it's warm in here now [Music] it's smoky in here too jesus louises i think we're gonna go with a 180 on the full spec see how it how it flows if the flow isn't there we're going up to 202. word word let's [ __ ] go all right so here's the plan parchment first okay and you guys are gonna get plugged in right now while i [ __ ] no every time i plug you in it [ __ ] disconnects when i [ __ ] unplug it so i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with that we're just gonna fold up our parchment real fast [Music] [ __ ] hambone [ __ ] ham bone good [ __ ] dude good [ __ ] [ __ ] hats off my hat's off i don't give a lot of props to a lot of people because a lot of people don't [ __ ] grow really really high quality [ __ ] like this i'll take it all day long brother you know something that's not often talked about is the uh the relationship how you have to grow with your farmer or hasher whichever way you're going you have to grow and collaborate together to improve the end product 25 and 160 mix micron test press dab let me add this real quick before i forget last time i forgot to [ __ ] do it um pull up my [ __ ] chat here god damn it oh my god that dab has my head spinning right now like i just down the [ __ ] bottle of patron all right yeah man that's that's that's no [ __ ] i don't give a lot of praise to a lot of people so ham bones my dude you crushed it and i got nothing but good [ __ ] to say for i can't wait to see what you do once i put a 20 kino in your head [Music] brick by brick by brick by brick by mother [ __ ] brick we are about to build this hatch house so something in my gut now is telling me to go up to my 202. something in my [ __ ] gut what is it what is it what is it it's in my gut it's in my [ __ ] nope it's deeper than my gut it's my nuts it's my [ __ ] balls my balls just spoke to me and they said why are you going to do something different than what you normally do don't change [Music] [ __ ] i don't know balls my brain is contesting you i just saw some [ __ ] on the press with the 25 and the 160 at 175 that was leaking but it wasn't a whole lot of it to leak so it couldn't really you know but then again am i just making excuses dilemma what say ye the people so i know i watched pedro's press this morning actually it was van ness how much pedro and i have very different styles of pressing but we both get very very good results at the end and i think that's a very good example of how different paths can lead to the same house you know um and ultimately because we both are experienced hashers both he and i know how to end up working the material after the press to where we can make it look the same you know in the end anyways you know the post-press manipulation is just really stupid these days with what you could do okay there's this next to the largest one we're gonna do it now a small one and this is the one we might test for 180. but i don't know i feel like we're entering the doodoo zone those of you that watch my stream know about the duder zone at 180 uh really 180 or 200 it's kind of like doodle [Music] dude hmm all right [ __ ] it let's let's test it on this small one that's what the tester is for right if this tester doesn't [ __ ] bleed beautiful [ __ ] terps i'm turning up the tab mister [Music] the [ __ ] go is in the house bro we've been bumping your music hard you've been busy making music [Music] he was live on instagram this morning too [Music] [Music] so oh my [ __ ] oh i just got that [ __ ] my balls just tug doggy from the inside you're like don't do it it's not hot enough it's not going to bleed fast enough don't do it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] what's up elite welcome to the grow room gang homie i appreciate the support nah [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] by the way if anybody's curious my directional flow fold is the easiest most least complicated easiest to collect off of method that i found i watched all those [ __ ] videos on youtube and these [ __ ] origami guys doing all this stupid [ __ ] not real origami but i mean all these rosin press dudes that are just doing the [ __ ] most and i feel like man one piece of parchment right you fold it twice on the ends so that way you can pinch that fold in and it doesn't leak out right you fold these sides good put a good crease in them okay don't fold the back too hard don't put it too big of a crease in it you might get a blow out if you the bigger the crease the bigger the chance for blowout all right then for me i know i need to cut off a little bit right to get it to flow into the jar where i want it and then fold it in half like you're making a [ __ ] paper paper airplane all right you guys remember this old school [ __ ] paper airplane [ __ ] from no time but you're not making the regular slow glider you're making that [ __ ] that fast one so you want to do the the um right that's what you're basically doing you're making that oh that paper plane right now when you open that up you get these beautiful folds where everything leads straight to the middle okay and you open it up what can i say except you're welcome for the tech that i share on this channel there you go now when it flows it's just you open it up you collect off one sheet you don't have like three different pieces of parchment to collect off of i mean come on kind of [ __ ] that's not good tech man you gotta [ __ ] collect it off of like three different pieces of parchment just so you can make it look cool i don't like that [Music] oh no too much what happened let me lose please talk to me seamless can you talk to me calm down you guys it happens it happens you know how many times i've accidentally muted somebody or put somebody on timeout all you have to do is accidentally rub something across your screen for like two seconds of the charging wire your hand if it's in your pocket whatever and you can like literally ban half the [ __ ] chat it's ridiculous i've done it like three times to people ocean's account was banned for like a month they didn't even use that account anymore it didn't even use it he was like [ __ ] it i'm getting on a different account [Music] so crazy that is craziness all right y'all remember the tech all right paper plane tech don't fold it straight to the the halfway point where the the fold is because then you might jam your rosin flow up a little bit especially if you keep it closed like this i don't like keeping it closed like this then the rosin gets everywhere it's more messy right that's why i make these folds [Music] my boy came straight back to the car what is up you couldn't resist it my tummy hurts i gotta go doo-doo but i'm too embarrassed to go at work on the public toilet i go home i need to [ __ ] on my own toilet i have a medical condition you don't want me to sit on your toilet it might spread the doctor said i can't share toilets with people it's a medical condition i'm not allowed to talk about it [Music] all right 180 one shot at one eight with a small bag we got 33 left on the battery so now i'm gonna set up the tripod and get you guys plugged in and in a good spot sorry my terps are running in that last dab that [ __ ] really [ __ ] sent me to the moon for a minute [Music] i can't even [ __ ] can't in front can't even front i straight blasted me to the moon and back [Music] now i'm just trying to get a cool spot for you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] good all right good fresh gloves um all right [Music] so [Music] [Music] um so i've got to figure out where i can get you that you're not going to be in the way because [Music] what i'm doing is more important than what you're seeing so i'm not going to be dead but you know this is what it is players all right first press test press 180 fahrenheit wedding crashers full spectrum hashtags and this is the smaller of the presses first can be a test see how it responds after temperature [Music] so [Music] i'm not even using any pressure i'm just letting that the hydraulics go down and towing basically right now [Music] so [Music] oh oh [Music] um uh h [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is foreign [Music] this is at a 180 right now oh it's just get all the terps out baby is [Music] happy mess is [ __ ] beautiful let's go [Music] [Music] um okay so let's keep it at 180 i feel like even a 1800 six all right let's see how it flows again at 180. whoa is that a bottle of tomatillo so you can stop carrying around your bottle and head to am pm instead right now buy any hot dog and get a second for a buck only at 8 00 pm too much good stuff buy one at regular price get a second of equal or lesser value for one dollar selection may vary by site while supplies last fire i got it pretty damn dry too all right well i feel like that's all we're gonna get out of those we might be able to push a tiny bit more yield out at the higher temps but uh that's why i raised it two degrees to try and keep the flow a little bit higher um beard hairspray did i put something in there uh there's nothing where do you see beard hair is that bro what are you talking about [Music] [Music] show me [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so sorry guys i'm bumping you around i gotta get the bag [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] who's your daddy [Music] wow [Music] um uh [Music] quality over yield keep it as low pressure as you can slam in my throat from allergies keep it as low pressure as you can and uh get as most like the most out of it that you can i get 95 of it like at the lowest pressure you possibly can and then ramp it up towards the end and get everything else out like i'm just barely hitting one ton right now [Music] [Music] uh [ __ ] this flow made my balls drop i've never seen anything squirt like this before oh squeak now [Music] well at least on his like sound stream or sound files why you got to play spanish as just because his name's hotto what the [ __ ] what's up roots just barely hitting two tons now is division anger is near the higher pressures [Music] [Music] i cannot breathe okay now we're three and a half almost four tons low pressure low temperature low and slow remember you guys talk about this low and slow or hot and fast no do do zone she passing the doo doo zone you get dookie every strain has its own doodoo zone but a good starting zone is typically between like 180 185 you start hitting that doo-doo zone and then you come out of it around 195 200 usually increasing pressure up to 5. people want to know what psi that is i'm sure five tons on this press right well one one ton is 2000 psi this bag is a two and a half inch by four inch bag it's probably only three inches though um it was actually it's about four inches i can see right here so it's four by two and a half all right so here's that ten so if i'm at five that's ten thousand divided by ten so i'm at a thousand psi going up six times we're gonna cruise it on up to seven eight watch the flow see if it increases at all if not then we'll pull it bacon vape is giving you guys the [ __ ] honey terps straight from the flowers and nipples secreting the nectar straight to the bee that's me i process it for you turn it into the honey here you go [Music] going up to 10 tons 2 000 psi just give me the tips just give me the tips and i'll start the show i could take another dab of three more eleven thousand at 11 tons now 12. i think it's safe to say we've gotten everything out of there let's call it delicioso now if the yield is not what i'm expecting off of this [ __ ] we're going up in temperature i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] how good this looks but we gotta test it i think because and we'll see what the bag starts with the back i feel a lot of weight on the parchment which is not a bad thing i don't care as long as i got out of the bag it's all about how this bag feels right nope it's all it's all gone there's nothing that is full extraction mode right there let's go [Music] [Music] well 182 is all right [Music] and i feel like i want more you must know expect 20 yield or less what you're talking about [Music] [Music] one remember you have to evaluate each and every strain they're going to react differently right now whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i feel like 182 is good but i feel like i'm gonna give it two more degrees go up to 184 okay just because i want it to hold a little bit more flow [Music] for flour it's about freshness you guys you guys flour flour flour you guys wanna talk about flour rosin i'll teach you guys some flour rosin who wants show of hands class class who wants some flower rosin tech while we watch the flows [Music] so nice stoney hell yeah okay okay calm down calm down no no spamming no spamming let's sit in the [ __ ] hallway kid you're on timeout um all right here's the thing you guys the trick with flower rosin is this i'm going to tell you and this is i always have a lot of unpopular opinions but i always have flame product so take it for what it's worth if you have to process flour the trick is my quick dry method okay making sure that it is fully bone crispy no fresh green fresh hay smell whatsoever okay pack it into bags as soon as it's done don't put it in turkey bags and burp it and blah blah blah blah i mean dry it on the branch until it is bone dry almost too dry you're not smoking it okay and despite what a lot of hashers like to perpetuate without actually having tested themselves okay humidity when you're pressing quality material does not [ __ ] help okay it does jack diddley ball sack squat for you i will tell any hasher i don't care how popular he is or how good his product looks i'll tell him to his face that's [ __ ] okay what matters is how fresh the buds are okay if you get it properly dried and you pack it into bags really fresh i mean like that night the next night right and you press it either really low and slow or kind of on the hotter end to 10 to 20 and fast okay and i guarantee you your yield is gonna be [ __ ] amazing humidity has jack diddly ball sack to do with it because i press my nugs as dry as possible i purposely avoid getting them too humid okay so it's about how fresh the butt is how well it was grown and then you process it at the proper temperature so that it doesn't sit there on the plates for too long and you will end up a really high quality product i kid you not i've tested it for myself all the different types of boveda packs curing it blah blah blah none of that matters what matters is that you press it you press it as soon as [ __ ] possible off the plants as soon as it's properly dried you know that's the key that's the key i've had hash rosin or i mean flower rosin look better than some people with hash rosin because of that that's all you gotta do [ __ ] humidity packs [ __ ] all the [ __ ] press it fresh it only matters if you if you're storing it and you need to keep the humidity proper cool you're not storing it you're pressing it within 48 hours minimum i mean maximum i press mine within like the first 24 hours if i'm gonna be pressing flour but i mean what do i know what do i know we're not even at a ton yet this shit's on fresh frozen this is not fresh frozen either this is dry this is sbnb quick dry method this is what i talk about collaboration with your farmers i taught him the tech so that he could bring me high quality material that was prepared the correct way and voila we have a winning combination that's how you collaborate with your farmer to make each other better man people don't understand flower rosin can be really really really clean and good and almost as good as hash rosin the only difference is you know the flower is going to give you a more in-depth complete entourage effect and the hash rosin's going to be a little bit lacking in that department but it's going to be a more pure taste a more pure concentration of flavor on just the purity side of things no not even a three week dry holy mole i'll do a video on my quick dry tech i know a lot of people want to know about it but i'll make a video i think i'm on top chat am i trolling i'm on top chat [Music] [Music] so thank you [Music] [Music] low and slow and high and fast don't always have the same yield it just depends on how good you are and if you can maneuver the material well enough if you find the appropriate temperatures for the low and slow then yeah you can really get a good yield out of it you know and really extract everything out of it but just by by nature and science you're going to get a slightly higher yield using a higher temperature because there's only so much that you can make up for by applying additional pressure the rest of it has to come from heat those are the only two factors at play here well if time heat um and pressure right so you have to find the the proper zone for the low and slow the proper zone for the hot and fast so that you maintain yield air quality on equal planes up to six and it's like what have you done increase the pressure up to about 10 tons here start getting everything else out of [Music] that [Music] earth wind and fire get her get her get her get her get down 12. 12 and a half calling it five four three two you know nasty mcnasty september to fill out 30th is don't forget to respond and make sure to count all kids living with you most of the year even if they aren't family members when babies and children are counted the programs that support them and their families get more of the federal fund you may need for the next 10 years is that the full extraction there's definitely nothing left in there [Music] uh i don't know full extractions i don't know yeah winston yes sir doing everything i can to extract the most out of her and uh see if i can't help him get a good indication of you know its potential there's no better way to find out the potential of a strain in my opinion than washing it and pressing it um in my opinion that gives you the ultimate ultimate experience of how good it can be really what's the yield what's the terps what's the [ __ ] you know what's it look like is it mostly terps is it is it a high thc content as well is it a good ratio i mean you can really understand a lot of that just by looking at it come off the plates by looking at it and feeling it as it comes out of the freeze dryer i mean there's just so much information there if you know what to look for as a hasher you know yeah that flower was [ __ ] on the money no doubt [Music] [Music] [Music] so oh no you lost a leg hold on get back on there that's fine we gotta give you there give me the sugar give me that [ __ ] baby looking [ __ ] fine as hell in there come here go find us over here give me some sugar baby very good from the time dude look at that [ __ ] flow [Music] so so i'm going to slightly disengage this press that's fine that's just the handle i'm going to go up and move my ram over just a touch because it's slightly off center there we go and then we'll keep the press going not advisable to do if you're not an experienced presser is [ __ ] restarting your press mid press don't do that a lot can go wrong but if you see something's wrong and you have the ability to fix it fix it don't settle for less that would have resulted in a less than optimal yield the bag may have potentially blown out something that needed to be corrected and corrected back on back on track man it comes to flow again yes look at that flow though back to our regularly tuned program go go hashing waterfalls ah no high pressure doesn't cause blowouts improper packing of the bag and increasing pressure too fast causes blowouts i press my flower up to about 16 to 17 tons on this press and my hash up to about 12 and i stop around 12 usually um laughs hey morty you're back okay i'll pull up the girls one monkey down and monkey number two what's up we're gonna be asleep uh nope she's not asleep but what and her cameras move but she's not standing up she's laying down so i'll give her a minute increasing pressure up seven times um angie it's time to take a nap lay down please oh good girl thank you increasing pressure up to 12 tons there's some good stuff in there still this one went up to 13 tons on this one give the good old countdown one two we're counting up because i'm high three four five we're done yes very sexy oh my god oh oh oh oh gosh goodness damn bone make a good team keep this up this is beautiful but what that yield do beautiful extraction full extraction is a good one the terp fiends will be happy your terps will get you high a little sneak peek got a little sneaky peeky oh yeah check some work [ __ ] real quick i usually don't have any meetings on mondays but i got to just double check that we're good angelica lay down it's time to take a nap please darn kids um ugh drippity drip drip drip we're literally at one ton right now just barely at one time don't believe me look so so we're up to three tons now i got really [ __ ] spaced for a second um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] let's go up to five times i think we got just about everything at that low uh pressure we're gonna get five times now give me my terps my need mass [Music] don't eat straight rosin i've talked about it before it's not good it's a it's a really concentrated essential oils if you get really good terpene content in there and it can burn you pretty good you can get chemical burn i put decarb rosin in my uh you know mouth and i tried a little straight glob off the press underneath the tongue doesn't feel good going up to uh seven eight oh i'm gooey mortgage

change certain aspects of what you might be doing at that time pressure temperature how long you're washing how rough you're washing how long you dry it for etc etcetera etcetera there's so many things that come into a play even before you pull it down off the plant so tuning in to the daily dabs we do this daily not pressing every day but we're depressing washing doing some grow room [ __ ] dabbing and talking industry tech all right 10 tons now um 12 times [Music] and we're good [Music] [Music] i'm just getting [ __ ] highs again i'm just getting [ __ ] high again [Music] [Music] please

well hit it while it's ready it's nice and warm [ __ ] it let's get it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so now i'm going to swap up to use this end it's longer i can get further down so [Music] don't use no [ __ ] drills you guys jesus i've seen people using drills with the dab tool attachment stop knock that [ __ ] off put some [ __ ] elbow grease put some pride into your work and stop risking putting metal shavings into your rosin just please stop it i don't know who in here needs to hear that but stop it it's really worth it well i'm not gonna get it perfect right now i used a day or two at least push that down [Music] [Music] okay now we're going to take the rest no give me my glove back ah give me my glue back [Music] apparently that finger is too warm got most of it down now here's the trick we'll pop it nice and tight i'm going to turn my plates down to where's that 84 i'm just going to put it on 84 right now i don't feel like adjusting the singles but normally i'd go to like 80 but uh 84 is fine and then uh what we do then is once i see the plates um drop below like 150 i'll go ahead and put this whole jar on top of the plates and it'll allow everything in here to come down to the bottom and combine together so i hope that helped some of you guys show you my process you know what i'm saying rosin on my arm i know it was just a tiny little speck of that thca flaky [ __ ] i grabbed it excuse me no no no real like jar tech really it's just enough to um get it to settle down you know that's why i lower the temp and i wait to put it on the plates and then uh what else

tech and wait for this y'all don't even know", "dc9wL5oTNWE": "[Music] Cannabis itself has been has been consumed for thousands of years and ever since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "iNlZ66flp1o": "what's up guys today we're gonna smash an eighth of wifi cake and then we're gonna test our rosin thc percentage on our sage analytics machine after that we're going to infuse our rosin with some butter and show you how to do the math to properly dose your servings let's get started by setting up our bag bottle text style [Music] and now we're going to heat our plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit so we can decarb our rosin so we're going to head over to our tester we're going to start off by calibrating our machine next we're going to have to specify what we are measuring we're going to choose rosin we're going to input our strain after we set our parameters we have to clean the measurement window next we're going to measure the empty cell then we're going to add our sample raws into the empty cell place it on the machine and hit calculate wi-fi cake is definitely potent clocking in at 68 total thc now let's take the rest of our rosin toss it in our decarb capsule and we're going to decarb our rosin at 240 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes once our rosin is de-carbed we're going to toss it in the freezer because it'll be much easier to collect and add to our butter next let's add some water to our double boiler and bring the water to a boil go ahead and throw in your butter and let it melt when your butt is pretty melted go ahead and grab your rosin add it to your butter and make sure to stir occasionally until your rosin completely dissolves check this out this is how to do the math to properly dose the equation is pretty simple all you do is you take the amount of rosin you extracted you multiply that by your total thc content that gets multiplied by 10 and then you divide that by the number of servings we figure this butter has about eight servings so each serving is going to have a little less than 82 and a half milligrams of thc thanks for watching and please dose accordingly let us know in the comments below what you plan on making with your rosin infused butter hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at nugsmasher.com", "1nDQEqUiV_o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "SwWQeTwtC00": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the

just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that

little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "7_nwzupVrZA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] aha [Music]", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "LOElLD68v8s": "get a good life [Music] [Music] we're back we're doing another press with some xxx og we're at stage one move it overflow this is the quarter pound sum triple XL g flour rosin just straight flour we're only at stage two stead of two more stages to go we're at 2,300 pounds of pressure we're running this at 109 degrees or under 90 degrees we just breached up to stage three we're still pressing we're gonna scoop this to collect or again where if you guys just joined us one of bras endeavor so we're at stage three and counting each stage is about 53 seconds the liquify time was 30 seconds 160 second total stages total cycle 45 46 thousand 46,000 pounds on the on the game we just went up to stage four so we're at 7,000 pounds of force which equivalent to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds 75 tons of pressure under a hundred and thirty one hundred under 130 square inches of surface area it looks like this is definitely going to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the parchment paper under there when we are at Stage four we're fitting it fish finishing up this full cycle you guys just joined us is more we're here at a stiched area here shooting a function video this is what the will be you're going on YouTube the self collecting we're at ninety three percent ninety three percent runoff so you got eight percent maximum amount of oil being stuck within your your your parchment paper so there's no need for scraping it's almost all self collected yeah we just finished the cycle we're back at home so let's pull this out it's for what have we got in the oven here what do we got okay that's quite a lot of oil I mean that's a quarter pound JK there was a twenty eight grams per bag for bags let me lift this up and show you guys what it looks like [Music] it's just these pouches every single time they come out like this", "2Qk9HH3Qslc": "[Music] hey guys it's Eric from peer pressure thanks for tuning in we're gonna be checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as

guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "UJMcueXzl4Q":

sure does straight up cheers [ __ ] not a bad haul so far [Music] [Music] terps [Music] i don't know if you see that well but it's gorgeous absolutely go just hamburg i can't wait for you to be able to dab bro you guys believe this [ __ ] hambone ain't even going to be able to try this [ __ ] can't have some [ __ ] straight [ __ ] you ask me it's my tradition to get the [ __ ] cultivator high as [ __ ] higher than he's ever been on his stuff before i like to do it i'm not i can't do it to him can't happen but nine to five soon though soon though i'm about to find out right now on the returns did you get my my instagram message right now about the hash return about 120 grams i think we could get another 40 grams out of it on the next run but it's [ __ ] really good high quality [ __ ] like really high i knew from the moment that i pulled it out of the freeze dryer and started sifting it that it was going to be a good yielding press because um the density of the trichome was unreal i had 30 grams in one bag if i ever hit 30 grams in one bag that that right there tells me that those trichomes are dense as [ __ ] because on average i'll hit 20 22 grams right 25 on the high end and then anything over 25 and those trichomes are just [ __ ] solid sand and um you guys want to see a golden vagina i do look at that golden vajayjay a little beat up missing an ovary but you know so um yeah man as soon as i started bagging it and i felt how heavy and dense those trichomes were in my hand in the back i was like yeah this is this is it and then as soon as i weighed the bags out and i saw one of them was 30 and the others were you know 26 and they were only three quarters of the way full um very very easily you could have fit quite a bit more in there so you know let's my early yield without even seeing it just yet altogether i'm gonna guess we're at 100 grams on a return that's just my guess my raw yes at this point in time looking at the jar and just kind of what's here we'll see i haven't had anything yield quite like the runs yet except for the frost factory and the dessert a while ago those things [ __ ] dumped the runts did hit 20 uh 21 percent which was pretty good but back in the day the frost factory and the g6 were getting 25 on the watch which was just [ __ ] ridiculous it was just a big bag of frost it was like i didn't even need to wash it i could have just shook the bag out it was crazy but this [ __ ] quality is great this quality is the same as the runts which is saying a lot you guys because i've never given any collab um that much credit before on their grow to be able to produce a quality as as good as my single source like i'm not arrogant but i do take pride in my work so to be working with another cultivator that's putting out work just as good as my own i don't have to worry about the quality you know what i'm saying it's just crazy crazy awesome to know like i truly don't have to worry about it you know what i'm saying because as a as a processor i kid you not i've run across all types of people in this industry there's very very very few people that can like truly be transparent about everything that they do and still maintain their integrity and you know what i'm saying so it's like he's super transparent with his grows i know what's gone into him i know what hasn't gone into them more importantly and i can trust his word when he says that they haven't been sprayed or they don't have any you know this that or the other whereas other growers i've had tell me that i come back home and i process their [ __ ] you know and lo and behold the hash never lies i don't know if you guys have been into hash long but that's been a saying that i've known since i got into this game the hash never lies all these other vho and all that other [ __ ] it covers up whatever you did wrong during the grow but when you run bubble hash real clean like the truth comes out so it's really nice to not get back here and start processing something to find out that it had been you know covered in [ __ ] oils during the grow and all types of other [ __ ] so let's see [Music] i replaced the filters on my hepa filter from iq air today like 350 bucks to get all three filters i got a pre pre-filter a pre-filter and then the hepa filter i put them all in today brand new and oh my god that [ __ ] is going [ __ ] the air on the ground around it started getting sucked up and it started filtering everything man it was [ __ ] nice see that [ __ ] current so strong on there [Music] oh i got to take a picture of that for handy bone hammer bone oh my god jeez in my bones juice in my pants oh boy you guys are not going to want to miss this if you know how to tap in i suggest you guys tap in now i'm going to go ahead and give this the insta oh my [ __ ] god i just pulled back the top layer on this and eminem y'all aren't gonna want to miss it all right let's get some of that down in there though set this down now we're going to clean the spoon on this side y'all already know we have to i'm going to get everything i can off of this big dab tool real quick on this end using my smaller dab tool and then i'm going to do something that i don't usually do which i don't usually go straight in for the stir but i'm trying something a little different decent amount of little rosin on here we'll be taking a test dab here in a second now i'm gonna see if i can't get my long end all the way down into this to do a little stirring stir [Music] y'all want to see this goody goody gumdrop my [ __ ] goodness holler at your hatch man unreal this won't even last a week guaranteed this won't last 24 hours i am i i'm putting everything on that this is gone gone gone i already know it the heat this is not three weeks worth of dabs for anybody this isn't gone from me smoking it not for me sharing it ain't nobody in there no nobody's smoking this in a week come on now not unless you're rolling it up in a [ __ ] giant blunts and giving them out for free look at that chunk in there that big old juicy thc chunk oh get your song who's your hash man mm-hmm oh boy packing a meal i'm all yeah yeah this is stupid i think i found my new favorite temperature hey baby um yeah but i'm just wrapping up i'll be done in about five well come here give me what's up y'all see it in there just chunks 207 on the 10th trying to incorporate all this stuff on the side to this nice jello pudding apple [ __ ] sauce son you hear that wet wet gushing around in there so so got it at four percent oh how does that always happen like this is just dumb diddly dumb stupid dumb dumb diddly dum dum dum stupid make your video real quick sir [Laughter] bro it's it's just dumb just dumb dumb bro this is like honestly the best collab work that i've had hands down this is easily on par with my single source and this is terpier than the ruts came out yeah at least from the stir it's it was just straight boulders underneath there that's how i always get it to come off the plates though it always comes off like that where i the i get chunks that just develop and it's awesome because when i go pack them into jars people go through and they're like [ __ ] i hit something hard in the jar and they're like oh [ __ ] it's [ __ ] bolder oh dude it's it's like peanut butter consistency but it looks like applesauce with pieces of apple in it yeah yeah yeah so i'm gonna go ahead i gave it this stir right now i'm actually still on the live i'm gonna go ahead and um oh you're good don't matter about to take that dab right now son [Laughter] that is [ __ ] hilarious bro that's awesome so that's what i said what's up telling the other anthony hell yeah that's what's up all right bro later that was [ __ ] hambone she said he [ __

back to the canvas small EA I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis extract reviews it's so awesome that cannabis has been legalized in Canada and now we're able to have these new product categories like essential oils extracts all those great things that we've been waiting for with legalization 2.0 but luckily enough everybody in Canada has been able to grow their own for cannabis plants since October 17 2018 and it's totally legal to share with your friends and so I'm lucky to know few great rosin and hash makers now before we dive any deeper into that what is rosin rosin is the process of excreting an essential oil from cannabis using heat and pressure so under heated platen you squeeze cannabis and excrete its oil you could do that with hash as well in a more refined matter and these are ways that we've now developed a hierarchy of the quality of rosin and different names that are associated with them from flour rosin hash rosin and live rosin we'll dig into all those things later so today we have some wonderful hash frozen a full spectrum hash rosin I believe and this is from the Tom Cruise of rosin absolutely fantastic product here and what do we have ice cream cake number four an ice cream cake I believe is coming to us from seed junkie genetics and it is a cross of wedding cake at gelato 33 so now you with their back crosses you get a bunch of different cookies and mints in there I believe July through three has triangle mints or the wedding cake story and then there's some sunset sherbert in there some pink cookies bunch of different things that all add up to those great California strains that have put a lot of companies on the map so that's our ice cream cake number four hash rosin you can see in the bottom it just looks creamy and delicious I think this is handsome heat cure going on inside of it let's crack into it and see how it looks and see how it tastes mmm fantastic just punch it in your face right away doesn't that look awesome see it's wet and Turkey mmm looks so good on the nose it is just a gas bomb creamy rubber gas confectionary like cookie dough oh it smells almost like Neapolitan ice cream the vanilla the chocolate the strawberry ooh so so good so much gasps so much creaminess going on absolutely great genetics and so as a shout-out to the grower this is just incredibly smelling so bright and so fresh and excited which is crazy too because this isn't a live rosin this is a cured hash rosin or a dead rosin because the plant isn't alive Wow and then I get lavender I get fresh lavender and and like sweet chemicals and that rubber and that gas and that fruitiness and that creaminess mmm smells just delicious delicious I can't wait to taste this mmm the smell is actually making my mouth water that's how creamy and fragrant and overall yummy this is I don't have a better word for it so an extract like this you know there's there's not more that you much more that you can get off the nose off the appearance from the that just looks so cool before I dig into it sorry creamy delicious let's have ourselves a dab shall we oh and it's just bada in there it's it felt creamy when I moved it will take a video of me really playing in it because it's gonna be delicious I'm sure that is popping up in the corner wherever right now probably this one that one I don't ever remember but here's our nice fat dab of this delicious gassy ice cream cake so I think everything goes back to a cut of OG the end of the day when I think about those lineages it's all just good fee knows of a G crossed over and cross over I got my puff coke peak we're set to the green setting and which is the medium low and I have a quartz insert inside of here for the best flavor and let's give this delicious ice-cream cake up Huff thanks so much for watching while you're here make sure to subscribe whoo it was a big dab we can fire it up holy surfer coughing everybody it's a lot of gas there's a lot of gasps creepy cookie dough petrol skunk ginger under ripe strawberry hmm it is so good and massive clouds of vapor - that was excellent absolutely no taste of what you might assume uh if you tried rosen's before great Roslin should have no taste of plant matter of any sort but should taste like all those amazing smells no we smelt it first and this one definitely does this has a great balance of complexity that's balance between the aroma and the palate it's unique its strong continues its flavor I would definitely be excited to puff more and more and more of this so absolutely fantastic great job Tom Cruise of rosin great job to the grower I apologize that I don't remember who the grower was I may have got that information somewhere but I forget so if I can remember that I'm gonna put a little shut up to the grower down here because none of this could be possible without the grower at the end of the day it's fantastic browsin absolutely love it high nineties score we don't need to break it all out kicks ass I want some more I got a call up Tom Cruise thank you so much for watching this cannabis extract review and unboxing I guess make sure to

Somali yay", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can

everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "xXSM2AHVEgQ": "[Music] saturday october 31st and me and clayton are back here at kenner herb farms and we're getting ready to press some rosin so come on in here and check this out together some flour to press some rosin yes this was fresh frozen and we're gonna work it over a little bit with the the blow dryer here to get some of the moisture out moisture out of it and then we're gonna get depressing right on yeah it's a little micron mesh bag so you can see you can see through the bag so as you press it the oil is going to come out through the bag onto the parchment oh yeah [Music] hey this time that's a great place [Music] and so right there's the rosin guys all that right around the edge we are here making some kiss my hash that is what we are making hell yeah well i am pre-weighing out our bricks all right what kind is that this is our cheese mix this is all dry sift dry ice crystal sift hash and you just don't get no more organic no moisture added back to it minimal plant matter no solvent no no chemicals in it hashes worldwide eat it you can make it in edibles you can top your cannabis bowls with it you can smoke it by yourself if you got that laid out come very very hot so that's your wax paper well this is this here is parchment paper yes same okay pretty much the same so brushing the excess off wow smell that i guess you can't smell it through the phone right here i can holy [ __ ] i wish i could just have that in a bottle and just be able to oh yeah oh yeah make that a cologne oh yeah hell yeah that's the end result right there and then we'll cut it into little one gram portions and so now those are zipped up and in there and then they'll be packaged later on all right that's our [Music] legal washington hash brand right on [Music] do [Music] you", "gDoH2jS4w3s": "all right how's it going everyone local joint a z thanks for tuning in just getting started here on today's episode of solventless hash q a gonna be having grow sciences on the show their ceo and co-founder matt blum will be joining us here shortly looks like he's already here forget quick matt uh thanks everyone for tuning in just starting this up so i kind of say the same stuff over and over at the beginning what's up matt what's going on my dude hey looks like you're in a pretty cool spot how's your day uh it's going well listen i'm i'm gonna grow how bad could it really be not too bad at all well thank you for taking some time to join me today i'm gonna say this probably five times throughout the episode here uh got matt here with grow sciences on the show if you've got some questions pop them in the question box at the bottom and i'll sprinkle those in uh but we've been talking with growth sciences for a long time matt just for everyone who's on the show here why don't you give us a little introduction about yourself uh and grow sciences your business sure uh thanks for doing this uh stream with us yeah and sorry my head is is bad i got a bad head so uh hopefully it's fine you're a much better head than i do yeah i don't know about that but that's okay so uh yeah my name is matthew blum i'm one of the uh co-founders here at grow sciences along with my partner uh mike and john uh founded our company in may of 2017. um it's been the ride of a lifetime and i'm pretty blessed to work with the greatest team on the planet and come to this place every day living my dream uh i started growing in 1997. um so it's uh almost 25 years i cut my teeth in northern california and santa rosa southern california arizona built out a couple facilities in colorado arizona cali wow um just kind of doing my thing in cannabis been through the raids been through uh the good the bad the ugly and uh still here you know i'm still here and it's it's been a hell of a ride and uh you guys have been uh a huge help for us the past couple years as we've uh gotten into the solventless game and you know we're all about producing the best clean products we can you know our mantra is patient over everything quality over everything um transparency and that's about it i mean uh we're definitely not the best looking people so uh we gotta go on quality at that point of time don't beat yourself up too much man it looks like you're in a pretty good looking room before we dive into some questions here getting a lot of love in the comments uh sounds like you guys have a nice following people are stoked on your products uh what's going on in the grow room that you're in right now this is the first time anyone's brought it there so nice work okay well i gotta tell you man i know there i i know the term is follower that's that's right but this is our family no like you know when we jumped into the game in arizona it was a race to the bottom there really wasn't a lot of quality in arizona and uh with this family which is on this live stream with us right now some of them they've kind of changed it all and it's all theirs this belongs to them not us there's not a day that goes by i'm not thinking about them mike's not thinking about them and every person in this building isn't thinking about them um we are nothing without them and i was nothing before them and if they were to leave i'd be nothing without them so uh it's uh we're here and i've got one goal at grow sciences produce the best highest quality clean cannabis whether we do it in a greenhouse and we address a lower price quality tier whether we do it on the top shelf tier it's quality above everything and you know in arizona right now there's a lot of stuff going on because we're in a drought and no one can get weed and it's just all bad right now and this is all happening during kobit which who knew this [ __ ] was coming you know like right who knew this [ __ ] was coming and it's just times are really bad for people um i wish i could do more i you know i'm not that smart a guy that's the problem so you know we're doing what we can here at uh at gs um i can take you and show you a little bit of this room i i think i can flip the camera yeah yeah please i mean uh love to mix it up show us what you guys got growing sorry i'm not the best technology guy bear with me hey no that's okay even if it's not working out too well if it won't let you flip okay oh there you go let me move this lens over though because i got this really cool lens from method seven okay oh there we go so uh let me actually walk to the front of the room this is one of our 40 light rooms okay and we'll kind of do a an over overview here so this is what our 40 light rooms look like uh we are in week six here we've got uh in front of us here is some runts and this will be our second run with it and let's see if i can yeah it's hard to get the focus just right but i can tell they're nice and frosty and people were even shouting out the runts uh in the comments right when you started uh your explanation so clearly this is a strain that people are excited about what's the lineage on runs do you know it's a skittles and gelato um frankly with all these gelato crosses they're all basically gelato right you know but it's we wanted to bring the genetics to arizona and other people are running it here too um someone else just brought up potent planet in the comments they're badasses they're another company down in tucson bringing mad quality to arizona um and there's other operators here doing it doing it too it's really good stuff so uh arizona's coming up man people people think it's all cali in colorado let me assure you there's fire in az um this is some apple fritter right here um she throws basically the the biggest nugs i've ever seen yeah those coals are huge man it's unreal like it's bigger than blue dream and we don't we don't grow blue dream here but i certainly have contents with it right but yeah the bd bad word you know well it is because it you know it gets overplayed and you know what are you gonna do uh so there's a little bit more apple fritter and then we got some of the alien labs cut of dosie does and some wedding cake so uh you know that's this room here we're week six um looking really good you know people always say [ __ ] blue dream but it's like it's the most bought wheat i think so someone's buying it i don't know who it is i i know if you're if you're a real head then you say you like blue dream you might get disowned by the community but for the people out there who are business owners such as yourself and there's a lot of people out there that actually enjoy it and i'll even admit that i've had a cut or two of blue dream that was certainly pretty good it's just a touchy topic i think uh yeah i think it brings a lot of opinions up but it looks like you guys have a nice really modern lineup of uh genetics in this room do you guys have a couple of these rooms yep so we have 40 light rooms we've got a 24 light room and then i've got four 16 light rooms and uh i can take you through i mean um you know i can take you through all of them everything everything's in different stages here we can only harvest one room a week i've only got nine trimmers we hand trim here so you know that's what we're able to accomplish and um the room next door to this is uh cushman's mac and skittles um nice and the room to the other side of it you know we got chem dog and then you know everything's in different stages so uh you know we will uh i'll show you whatever man we're always down to do that you know sure yeah i know you're holding your camera too so if you get to a point where walking around is easier just make sure you're close to some wi-fi so uh we can we can keep up the stream but you know this this is a great way for me to ask maybe one of my first big questions is you know we're talking about genetics here do you guys shop around for genetics specifically for solvent lists what is your process for where your growers decide what you're gonna grow sure um so i run the cultivation um i have a cultivation manager and then there's about eight other cultivators here um they do all the real work um i'm a nothing um i basically laid out the plan feed you know i built the rooms um i walk them multiple times a day but the hard work is being done by the cultivation team obviously and uh you know the de-leafing the training the [ __ ] that makes equality is done by them um but yeah i'm in it all day every day and uh i can't imagine not being and you know my partner mike runs the executive side and uh you know the rest is history i like kind of developing new products and you know just all that stuff you know i like to work on the rosin cartridge that took us about 10 months to get going um yeah it's it's everything so i want to get into uh some solventless edibles stuff like that and it's all about building a bench and how do we do it with genetics i basically leverage the relationships i've had for 20 plus years to get clones but we'll spend upwards of about five thousand dollars a month on seeds wow yep we do massive pheno hunts uh we're about to feno hunt about 400 seeds spanning 28 different cultivars uh majority for rosin so majority for rosin um hey there's potent planet in there right now those guys i was talking about those don't ignore this dread pirate guy though he's one of those genius extractors but he's an [ __ ] a lot of personalities in here so one of the comments that we just got that i would like to dig into a little bit more is you know why do you choose the strains that you choose you know what are you guys looking for a diverse flavor profile across your strains are you looking for something specific in each one i mean how why do you do the strain selection and what are you going for so it actually so three years ago i would have answered that question with quality doesn't matter otherwise now i have to solve like five different things which are number one it has to be of the highest quality number two it has to yield at least a certain amount do i need to hit three a light on everything no but i can't hit one and a half right that's just not gonna work um it has to look good in our jar but here's one of the biggest things that i never hear people talk about with commercial it has to trim well i do not want to deal with my trim crew when i hand them flower they don't like trimming it's it's just [ __ ] bad it's real bad i mean they tell you and so it has to trim well you got to hit like five different metrics for it to be a winner here so you know i loved the meat breath we had a cut of meat breath we pheno hunted i loved it but you know it didn't yield for [ __ ] for us and because they didn't like trimming it and that was the end of the meat breath plus potent rocks the meat breath they grew it better than we did anyway and uh you know they're killing it so um you know it all goes into it though so like take runs right so we just did our first run with runs um we're actually about to start curing it and we've done the live rosin press from it so we only yield it on the hash side to some odd percent okay so definitely not even break even yep at two percent i'm not going to be able to run that strain uh that genetic for uh live rosin outside of the lowers so i can take the lowers and i could do live rosin out of that um but we're not going to do whole plant there's just no way whereas right next to the runts in that room was our willy's cush cake which was a sea junkie genetic ran at almost six percent hash that's great you know those are great numbers 83 on the rosin conversion that's a great number um and frankly you know that's what you're looking for is above 80 percent on the rosin conversion and really above four and a half percent on the hash side yeah and we'll still do stuff that's less like the skittles for us doesn't really yield more than two to a half percent but i love it that's all i'm sure the people love it [ __ ] turf profile is what i'm all about when you open up the little jar of it it just hits you in the face so i like it and because i own the joint i get to run some of those yeah so you can you can make some executive decisions on some of your favorite strains that make it through to the live rosin that's it you know and yeah we don't get to run a ton of it because you know i'm not going to tank our books because you know it is a business and and we have to do well here i've got big aspirations to just experience to make you know okay so you know how microsoft minted all those millionaire secretaries do you remember that story i don't know if i'm a lot older than you are yeah i am vaguely aware of that story actually yes you know they minted all these the original people that were microsoft whether they were secretaries or not all became millionaires if they did the stock you know i want to mint the first millionaire trimmers so i want everybody who's at this company to [ __ ] murder it like i want when this day comes like however long i'm in this for you know i want everyone to come with me and you know so i like paying for everyone's health care you know i like that stuff i i like getting food for the team all the time i like i don't know i just i wanted to have a certain quality of life and it is so we do have to run it as a business um we just have to do it the right way and be transparent that's all like owning all our [ __ ] because let's be real this company you know if it's being led by me it's being led by one of the biggest [ __ ] ups on the planet and the good part about me is that i know i'm gonna make a lot of mistakes and hopefully we we figure it out but this family you know we have to do another one of these streams where i just put them on it because you guys never get to talk to them and that's the story the story is the team that works they are just i don't know man i don't i don't know i just don't have words they're they're uh they're better than me you know and that's how it should be so uh i'm good with that you know well let me take your thought one step further and this is something that you know we spend we've spent most of our time on our solvent-less hash q and a's talking with cash makers who are also business owners but i think a lot of people in here would love to get some more perspectives you know from you as a business owner creating company cultures that are positive that people want to work in that is not a common experience for a lot of people in the cannabis industry there's a lot of turnover there's a lot of vicious you know business owners that only care about their bottom line and what you're telling me is that you know you guys take a different approach so you know is that you know the quality of the company quality of the product all tied together that's all part of your ethos right so here's the deal man we all in this planet love making money listen i love high-end alcohol you know i'm kind of a drunk in that regard like don julio 1942 you know all that stuff like i live for that so and i love food you know i love i love food too so drugs alcohol and food it's not cheap um so yeah we care about the bottom line but let me just tell you this is not a company that that nickels and dimes we could be making a lot more money um but it was the quality of life and i stand by that 100 and i'm going to stand by it until my last breath as the owner of this company um and these these family members if you meet them and i and i don't just meet like the employees here but it's like our patients you know we're not a rec state yet so for us as patients i'll call them i'll call them customers when we go wreck but they're in this with us they they know there's more to this i i really hope they do i feel like when i'm out there talking to them you know i've had the honor of getting to butt tent at a local dispensary here a couple of fridays just to you know kind of talk to people directly yeah i know there's more to this like they know that every state's gonna make a decision at some point in their wreck market and it's going to be am i going with the big corporate or am i going with the small corporate and let's be real we are a small corporate like yep there's 40 people you're not mom and pop anymore yeah man i mean i've got 340 likes we're outputting 400 pounds a month you know it makes me act better it's better for the people here but you're gonna have to make a decision in all these wreck markets like who are we going with and you know it's it's what it is and someone just said true med on the stream [ __ ] yeah true men man those are my guys i i love them to death i talk to them almost daily um true med is in the hall of fame and we're [ __ ] so lucky to have them in arizona um it's it's that simple we're lucky to have true infusion we're lucky that potent planet we're lucky to have nectar farms like you know enough of this it's only cali man like az's got it and why people think less of a z cannabis has a lot to do with packaging and it's something that no one out there for whatever reason is talking about and if you get cannabis directly from my building like if i know you or you know we get cannabis from the building like i put it through a normal patient allocation or whatever i have to do it is a different experience than when you buy it at a store you know it gets jarred we seal it in our custom jar then it goes dispensary then it gets sold it's not the same everybody in the industry everybody in the industry whether it's jungle boys alien labs i've spent tens of thousands of dollars traveling between colorado arizona california washington yeah and it's everywhere right so marijuana is meant to be packaged in a ziploc bag from your dealer's turkey bag and hand it off to you 24 hours later yep we're not able to do that um so we're going to do the best we can with what we've got yeah and it's dry out there too right i mean it's dry in colorado it's super dry down there even more so that's it you know that's it so um we're gonna do our best we're gonna try and continue to do the best and all that stuff so you know mike and i my partner and i actually invested in a packaging company to try and figure out our jar and i know 710 just came out with a vacuum sealed jar we have a vacuum steel jar and it's it's got to go uh it's we got to go further we're on the first iteration um but we're still here so uh we're gonna acquire some greenhouses soon because i want to address that 25 30 8 with clean cannabis and i hope arizona chooses to stay with gs like i hope they know that that we're with them no question about it because this [ __ ] keeps me up at night you know when i'm responding to the dms at 2am in the morning or when i'm on reddit and and y'all are giving me heartburn from the crazy [ __ ] you're saying or you know whatever it is like you know i'm here and you know let me know how i can make it better for you guys i'm [ __ ] that's it that's all i care about so let me let me throw uh a little softball your way we had someone ask this or comment this at the very beginning tell the people about your stimulus efforts that was a legendary commitment to the az community tell me about that what is what happened there what does that even mean um well let's just spend a little bit of time on it i'm not really big on talking about the stimulus okay when times were really shitty when covet first hit we decided to give away as much weed as we could i think we helped out some people for a very small amount of time it's something that i feel has to become a permanent part of our operation i don't know how that's gonna look um i think it helped out a little bit uh okay and just trying to get back to the community that's it man and and it's it but you know i'm not big on uh stimulus is over we did it and and let's move on let's move on to the next one it's an honor to serve the people of arizona that's that's how i feel about it okay let me throw another one at you then about growing what's the best week to start training plants cultivar specific for me so for rogs we just send them straight up for the most part um you know we'll put about 140 of them in a row which is about 16 a light and you don't have to do a lot of training with that uh with a plant like the runts we'll start uh week one probably day six or seven and then we'll train through day twenty um we'll do some minor defoliation but basically goal being phil every square of your uh canopy and we operate in a four by four area um that's how we rate everything is by four by four and that's it and we have high numbers we need to hit here you know we're sure we're shooting for 2.75 a light we've never averaged that unfortunately but we do shoot for it we get close uh but we're always dialing in the tech and that's great but to answer that question day one through 20 you're always you're training your plants out because by day 21 unless you're rocking like a gmo it's pretty much set in stone what you're going to be looking like as a plant at that point you know you're you're defolding along the way to open up sites to make sure the light comes in but at that point it's more about you know moving water throughout the plant it's it's not so much about blood structure okay i got you that's great and i mean honestly it sounds like your acumen when it comes to growing is probably so much bigger than most people would guess because there's a lot of people who run or own cannabis businesses that they don't get in the grow that much they're just more looking at spreadsheets and they're on their computer so you know for people who are on here that are trying to run their own businesses or thinking about doing it like what's the best advice you could give to new cannabis business owners who are interested in getting into the market you know whether it's in arizona or anywhere else sure sure um so first and foremost my ass does do a lot of spreadsheeting so i haven't had a lot okay you know doing production schedule and data analysis and stuff i never thought i'd see myself doing um so i am lame in that regard and it's not lame that's how you run a business the right way you know you gotta know excel sorry guys for everyone who's tuning in that's the that's the hard that's the hard truth is uh if you want to run a business learn excel can i tell you what my advice is to anyone trying to get in because there's still time to get in the capital markets have dried up unfortunately because of med men and these [ __ ] msos which i'm sure my partner is going to yell at me when he hears me say that you know the money's gone no one wants to put equity investments in because you know because it got [ __ ] up right i mean it's just all bad out there i mean what was the one yesterday bilzerian blew 50 mil of other people's cash you know i mean on cbd products that are basically nowhere you know it's like how on earth do you you [ __ ] i mean it just i don't know man that just makes me nauseous so um you know what are you gonna do though but uh this is my advice find your passion whatever the hell it is i don't care if you want to be a garbage man be the absolute best garbage man and i promise you you'll make good money because the people who make money are the ones that are the best at what they do it's they're the best at what they do because they love doing it and it's not a job you know i love coming to this place i'm here seven days a week um you know i get here at whatever let's call it seven am in the morning i leave at five at night six at night and uh i love coming and that's seven days a week i mean i haven't had a day off since a long time so i used to go to vegas but obviously during covid that's out i lost my 40 hour trips to las vegas so i've been here and and i got to be here because i i owe it to my team here i mean when covid hit this team stayed my packages stayed my trimmer stayed i mean these were people who were being threatened with eviction by unscrupulous landlords and i know that's a whole different political issue and people don't like hearing my my [ __ ] with that so i won't go there um but everyone was having a real tough time and these guys stayed they stayed and they worked and they worked in in the most stressful environments i owe them at least that much to be here you know like i owe them at least that much to be here so i'm here and uh like i said i don't know what i do without these guys frankly so uh i don't know so my advice to people if you want to get in find your team trust each other like you cut off a finger for the guy and girl to your left and right and go don't think about it just go okay that that's great advice and just kind of looking at my list here you know i'd love to talk a little bit more too about your guys's solvent-less efforts you know us being peer pressure and making solvents equipment you know did you guys just start off growing with the intention of doing solventless all along or did solventless come into the equation somewhere along like how did that become a part of your business and why yeah okay so two years ago i couldn't spell roslin so uh i was involved in a pretty high profile raid at the end of 2016 which is why i went to the state license system with gross sciences after that um with that i was kind of out of the game let's call it for a year when when this all hit literally couldn't spell rosin but my team you know like i was telling you about here are the biggest weed snobs in the in the earth as far as i'm concerned like they love telling me when it sucks literally they're like man this flower sucks so they were saying to me you gotta try this rosin you gotta try this rosin everywhere and uh that was that and i said well wait a second you know let's let's take a look and it just fit into our mantra clean cannabis i mean listen i know some brilliant extractors you know whether it's io whether it's you know a dread pirate who's with potent whether it's uh my due daisy extracts tanner these are people who make phenomenal concentrates with icy carbon no question about it but something about rosin you know just hit and we basically knew nothing and just spent a lot of money to learn and we made mistake after mistake after mistake um let me just tell you right now that january of last year i delivered flour rosin to dispensaries it was dark wasn't pretty it was pretty much [ __ ] and we were charging you know uh i think the dispensaries are charging sixty dollars a gram um yeah [ __ ] up right epic i mean you gotta start somewhere what are you gonna learn from it is it really a fuck-up right so um we've just learned and we've just barreled through like you know you know was we just barreled through and someone just commented uh smirk was a huge part of gs 100 he was so smirk whose actual name is john was my first cultivation manager here i hired him only a few months after i had got the building rolling and he was a massive part of this and he's over at loud lab in tucson doing great things and him and i talk about doing uh projects together to this day so awesome don and you know he's the dude sounds like you don't burn bridges yep and people listen man it's cannabis people are gonna move on to the next and greater thing and uh i'm happy for them you know and then we always make our way back later on so to get back into the solventless question you guys you know it was kind of a rocky start oh yeah where did you find some zen with your hash rosin it seems like that's where you probably had a big breakthrough basically it took us a year of beta testing we would run genetics and basically how we would do it is we would harvest it 52 days 56 days 60 days 65 days and 70 days yield color rosin conversion i mean just everything um absolutely everything and finally getting to the point we're at now but listen we get tons of complaints about lack of variety um i think a lot of people are really sick of gmo i get it um you know i i totally get it uh but we have a lot more new flavors coming out but it's tough to dedicate whole plants to rosin you really got to know what you're doing or you'll lose your ass and you know we lost easily a million dollars last year learning rosin simple wow no question about it easily easily so um now i know we're here on the quality side i truly believe that and now we're doing a lot of pheno hunting um you know a lot of the pheno hunting we do now is all for rosin and uh that's about it so you guys you know spend a ton of time money energy r d solventless and now all we're seeing in the comments are a million people saying how great your products are you guys have made carts you're making hash rosin tell me about your products tell me about your sku selection now that you've gotten over the hump of a lot of the trial and error or at least some of the harder parts you know you guys are making cards tell me about your sku selection with your solvent list so i kind of we like to keep it pretty lean here frankly okay so we did you know we spent about 10 months perfecting what we think is a great rosin cartridge we've had great traction in the market with it um you know we kind of went through various iterations of how to make it work um while adding nothing to it you know we we wanted a cartridge that was 100 rosin that's it and they're all live rosters um they're our most premium product um and now we're just doing different flavors of it so we'll take a base whether it's a wedding cake a gmo um and then we can add in so some of the new umami genetics the pink pellegrino the agua frescas we can add in our straight lemonade we can add in a purple punch which is like a fruit punch um all of that stuff you know we can you know we can do all that and that opens up some possibilities for us uh but really i think our next iterational product is going to be the edible side of it awesome i'm trying to we're in the middle of beta testing some solventless edibles um that's been a rocky process but we're but we're going through it um which is how we usually get things done here it's really never easy um and then this 7 10 friday we're actually we're dropping so i'm going to be butt-tending friday over at local joint which is this dispensary right next to our building awesome yeah it's the best stuff man our patients get to come in and voice their concerns and uh they don't [ __ ] right like it's it's no [ __ ] around crew that shows up for that but we're dropping a lot i mean we got runs live rods and hog with fresca's jam live rosin we got pink elegrino live rosin just a just a ton of [ __ ] um and uh i love doing that and we got a ton of new flavors coming and we're now dedicating two of our largest rooms here just to rosin so we're gonna keep everyone stocked but you know unfortunately no one's ripped the band-aid yet that you know this drought that's going on everywhere is because it takes so long to navigate this regulated nonsense we have to deal with and it's bad right i mean the regulation is is is tough i mean we're regulated harder than the food you eat at a grocery store or you know what you buy at a restaurant um the drought's only going to get worse in arizona no one's wanting to be honest about this scenario we're about to go wreck we're gonna vote on it in november they'll institute it by about may as my guest they're talking about january no shot i'd say by may and then it is going to be a [ __ ] show in arizona i mean 65 top shelf aids because let's be real who's going to absorb that 16 tax you know the dispensaries aren't probably going to absorb that they're going to pass it on to the consumer um we got to figure this out i mean growth science has to kill i mean growth sciences has to get a lot bigger um and uh yeah that's that's on my mind a lot you know i i know people are worried it's on my mind a lot and i'm worried about it and guys when you say the drought just so i'm clear you're saying that demand is vastly outstripping supply right now it is so when covet hit the arizona shops exploded so stores that used to order 200 eights a week from us we're ordering twelve hundred thousand holy cow so you guys are one or two x increase we're talking about six x increases here and everybody's in a drought right now so um we're gonna try and lead by example and throttle our pricing um you know we haven't raised our prices a lot of people have we haven't um we kind of stopped working with the vendors not vendors but the dispensaries that were fighting us on that in a certain sense uh which is fine that is their prerogative and they are fine to do that that's their business and they've invested millions of dollars and i do not uh blame them for that but you got a way that you run things and you're sticking to it i i'm trying my best you know and i'll fail a lot but i'm certainly uh i'm certainly trying my best so you guys are trying to grow then that's what that's what i'm hearing demand is going crazy we're expanding our indoor right now so we're going to be breaking ground hopefully here shortly the next few months uh we're going to go about two and a half x our current size we're going to bring our extraction solvent extraction in-house right now we outsource our bho product to the best in arizona to extract we are going to bring that in-house we are going to bring a kitchen in-house and we're going to expand cultivation by two and a half bucks but but that doesn't fix the problem because let's be real a lot of people on this stream probably buy your top tier but that's not what most cannabis sold is most cannabis sold is in that 25 that and it's bad right now it's real [ __ ] bad right now and it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be so we've got to get into a greenhouse and that's what i'm trying to do right now and we're going to grow some amazing cannabis in there and we're going to address those tears and that's it you know and and that's my plan and i'm going to try my best like like i've been saying it's the best i can tell you um and i just hope everybody hangs in there with us because i'm depending on them you know hey growth isn't always easy and that's something that we've learned here at peer pressure recently too because we're expanding like crazy and it's a really tough process are you guys seeing as much demand for your solvent lists as you are for flour or is the flour it's the same okay either and it's just the same and uh yeah now the salt the ross inside i think i can fix better because i dedicated 80 lights to it so instead of just taking random sections i'm dedicating i'm dedicating 80 likes to it um so i think i'm really going to to have that figured out at least for a better level gotcha then obviously when i have the greenhouse i can address a lower priced rosin tier um we're also trying to make the switch to organic living soil uh next year commendable yeah so we're in the middle of that uh we're in the middle of uh that test right now and it's going pretty well um you know it's it's what it is but really what i'd love gross sciences to be remembered for if someone was asking was that we were here for the patients when it went wrecked and we kept this state from going to [ __ ] in the sense of the battle became about quality on all tiers not not the quantity not the race to the bottom not you know not [Music] i'm not you know not [ __ ] not the stuff that none of us got into this for i mean you know i started smoking so long ago that i know that what i was smoking was probably toxic you know 25 years ago my weed had more seeds than an advil bottle did um it's better now and people should get better and for the people like me that have the honor of being in the industry after the raids and after all the the [ __ ] we owe it to the next generation to do this [ __ ] right and um i think we have an at that to do that and i'd love to to take this family to california and i'd love to take this family to wherever it wants to go and weed for me has been my life man it's it's not a part of me it's just kind of everything it's how i got kicked out of my house it's how i dropped out of college it's how i lost everything so many times it's how i would walk into random spots and smell someone else who had weed on them and we could like share a glance and know that we're in the [ __ ] together without saying a word [Music] all that stuff is real to me and i'm just i'm not gonna jeopardize it and we owe it to that next generation to show them what the [ __ ] is up from the older people like me and uh i'm gonna do what i got to do and that's it well it sounds like you guys have some pretty big plans at growth sciences you're talking about uh going out of state too what are some markets that you guys are looking into or is that confidential nothing here is confidential um so we're looking heavily into san diego right now [Music] i would love to be in nevada because i'm a drunk and a gambling addict so vegas is your home you know my vacations are usually i leave thursday after work and fly back saturday from vegas and you know yes and you know i i love that [ __ ] you know i i love uh i love it and uh so i'd love to go nevada california arizona but here man i'll tell you what you know i was in colorado picking up a lot of different products a few months ago and um i love that there's still rock and deli style there and i'd love to be a part of that like i love deli style like it's [ __ ] heartbreaking we don't do that as the normal anymore um but yeah you know it's uh yeah it's so i'd love that but california nevada arizona hell yeah all day nice nice that that'd be cool i mean a lot of people in the comments are sounding like they'd love to see you we had a question asking you guys about you'd be up in the northwest because they said that they didn't like too much of the solvent lists up there um it sounds like solventless has come really far in arizona was solventless a big deal even a year ago is this more of a recent phenomena for you guys it's it's the last year i would call it since basically june of last year to june of this year but you know i think that people took chances on us you know the community took chances on us and um it's paid off for both of us because it gave us the opportunity to get better at our craft and it gave them the opportunity to get into solvent lists if they weren't already um and let's be real most of the kids that were into the solvent list were going to cali and just getting it illegally right you know it's still there and i'm not gonna talk [ __ ] about the black market i was the black market and a lot of my friends are and that's that this this whole thing was on their backs and uh that's that we'll just leave that one alone yeah i think it's just worth noting very briefly that you know experience didn't come from nowhere as it were you know people had to learn the hard way and it sounds like you know you've been involved growing for a long time so you know where do you see solvent list going with your operation as the year progresses what what is what is your solvent-less outlook right now outside of edibles everything everywhere everything um basically i want to come out with some new consistencies and when i say i'll come out with the consistencies that means i'm going to take credit for my lab manager tanner's genius and he'll actually come out with the consistency and um we'll rock and roll that way um i basically just want to get solventless in arizona along with other players in the market you know potent planet should be in this [ __ ] uh true infusion should be in this [ __ ] who the hell wants to go to a dispensary and just see one brand that's not sexy no one wants that like going to jungle boys store they got other brands in there like you want to have options you know when i go to the dyspo i'm always buying other people's stuff yeah so other people need to jump in and the good news in arizona is we have this magical thing we're in a drought so there's no competition just come out with a good product you'll have a seat at the table we're making the table bigger we're making the table bigger we don't need to compete with anybody come on in let's [ __ ] rock and roll right so if there's a drought there's plenty of room here for other growers and other operations i mean one thing that i'll say that's incredibly refreshing talking to you is just your honesty and your humility i feel like there's so many egos in the cannabis in the hash world that are just absolutely outrageous you're coming at this very level-headed so you think that there's plenty of room for people in the market that's a perspective we don't hear super often there's nothing worse than an arrogant fat dude let's leave it at that it's not pretty it's like a fat man crying you just don't want to see it no one wants to see that yeah everyone's got ego i've got a huge ego you know whatever uh i think it's healthy and here's why i think it's healthy it's because people love this [ __ ] so much they love this [ __ ] so much and i love that they love it that much so i'm in let's just keep it going here's what i don't want i don't want people to lose their passion and if that means they'd rather be a snob or arrogant done let's roll i'm good with it okay i'm good with it so there's definitely a difference there between what you could maybe call uh a healthy obsession passion ego for cannabis being obsessed with quality versus just being so full of yourself that you won't even listen to other people and you don't even want other people to be a part of your market is that a fair distinction to make perhaps who the hell wants to live like that anyway that just sounds like listen i ain't donald trump i mean i don't know [ __ ] frankly what it is you know i'm aware i don't know [ __ ] so yeah i love listening to everybody and um i'll try to keep us as level-headed as possible and i'll fail i'll be better then you know it is what it is and you know i'm in my 40s now i'm too old is what it is well for everyone who's tuning in here uh we will have this full episode up on youtube soon and you can watch it on instagram after the fact for everyone who's tuned in late or who hasn't been here for the whole thing we've got matt with growth sciences out of arizona this is one of the biggest audiences we've ever had some of the most positive comments we've ever had clearly you guys have a huge following you're doing it right uh you know matt i'd love to also uh some of the time that we've got left here you know we talked a little bit about some of the advice that you had for people who are trying to start businesses what advice do you have for people that are trying to get their grows locked down you have a ton of grow experience and that's something that you know we don't often hear enough of uh with our extraction world but it's as soil grown said on one of our last episodes you know thank a grower what advice do you have for people to grow the best quality product possible if you don't love cannabis don't be a grower that's step number one stay out of my business okay like this is a business for people who love cannabis and love people if you don't love people and you don't love cannabis you're not a grower i don't care if you have 18 degrees from mit and you know everything and you can speak to any science i don't give a [ __ ] your cannabis isn't going to be for me so number one you want to love cannabis you want to love people once you have that then it's all about building your bench you've got to have a team around you that has the same focus passion and compliments your weaknesses you know i'm not a i'm not a businessman you know i'm not a technology guy i'm not smart you know but my partner mike you throw is a [ __ ] genius and he's a true executive and a good person and you know him and i agree on almost nothing and that's why it works that's why it works we find that middle ground together and i feel like there's like magic there you know um i think that you've got to have good legal on your side most of the criminals are not in the black market they're in the state license game let's not kid ourselves more [ __ ] goes on in the state license system that i can even talk about because i sell at all these dispensaries and you know it is what it is um a lot of bad people a lot of unscrupulous business people and uh you gotta avoid that you've gotta pay for your deal properly you have to have a proper lease on your on your cultivation facility you have to have a proper lease with your approval to operate with who's ever giving that to you because licenses in arizona right now cost seven to fifteen million dollars holy cow seven seven to fifteen million dollars is that to get operational break that down just a little bit for me because that sounds like illinois pricing no no that's the license that's nothing that's just a piece of paper that says you can grow sell or extract seven to 15 million and let me give you the worst news you want to know who owns them all harvest they've got 30 plus out of the 130 in our state and we're going to talk about that there's no monopolies come on anyway i got to get off that topic because it's not good so yeah so your legal counsel would advise you to yeah they've already i'm getting i'm getting the looks right now so it's bad so here's the deal though this is the deal though seven to 15 million to get a license 150 a square foot to build out cultivation once you've acquired the building two hundred thousand dollars in legal uh what else let me make sure i remember this all right then you gotta have a six-month runway of operating capital right so throw another half mil to 750 000. uh your insurance is going to be off the charts uh we pay for everyone's health care at our company that's off the track there's all these different things right i mean you know it's millions and millions of dollars so uh you gotta have your team you gotta have your bench [Music] and the rest is uh you know it's gonna be a mixture of luck drive and passion and uh that's it and yeah i wish i had something better to say but hey you know what i think honesty is the most important thing that people could stand to hear who are trying to get into this do you think that if and when arizona goes wreck that that will become more expensive or less expensive well i think it could stay the same because i think rack excuse me that's a weed cough not corona don't worry um is already built in to these prices because they're [ __ ] right so take a dispensary that's doing 300 000 a month 3.6 million a year let's say that they're running at 18 net which is about the average call it 20 right that means they're making 720 000 who on flux earth is paying 15 million for that your roi is 20 years down the road so yeah it's all garbage right but um i think rex built in but if you're like a a true med you know who murders the game right now yeah you're probably gonna be more than that um you know it's so i think it's all the ways but no i think for the most part wreck is probably already baked in to those numbers i certainly hope so because you know the iteration of growth sciences i'm looking for is us to be in the retail dispensary gotcha i want to have grow science as the dispensary so that mike and i can build out the customer experience the way we've always thought it needed to be and um that's the iteration of growth sciences that we're truly working on frankly uh if we were to talk confidential that's the most i'll say about it but we need to go vertical i need a place for patients to come in where they know it's gs and uh i'll be there for them to talk [ __ ] too if we make a mistake no that's awesome that you guys you know really have a vision for where you're trying to go with all this you know we've got about you know five six minutes left here um you know we kind of i i put a lot of questions together we've gotten through some of them you know i'd love to give some of this remaining time to you you know are there any topics that you want to cover or that you feel like you could educate people who are tuned in on uh you know we're really big on education and just trying to bring up the community with us um you know what do you want to share with everyone are there any topics you want to cover before we wrap up um i mean topics i'm not really uh sure i think a message i'd like to leave with everyone is people are really hard on each other in cannabis for whatever reason and i get it once again it's because everyone's passionate about it i think people think we make it look easy i i have to tell you guys we make so many mistakes getting to where we are every single day you know hang in there with us and if you're thinking you know whatever reason anybody can do this if you love cannabis get into it don't give up on your dream don't let the msos own this [ __ ] you can do it the people want to believe where they go to buy their cannabis we're not 10 years down the road yet where people are just you know maybe stop at a convenience store you know to buy their [ __ ] like we're still in a time where people want to care about where they shop and they want to care about what they're putting into their bodies and and all these different things and um if your dreams to be in cannabis go do it you know i i i lost my choices early on with all the felonies and [ __ ] like that you know i is what it is right you know my parents were both doctors i should have gone the legal way of life and you know i didn't have a lot of friends in high school and my choice was to connect with the people who connected with me over marijuana and you know it started you know when i was 13. i had cancer and i was lucky enough to have cannabis and uh that's my family like that's who i'm with my family are the cannabis people we speak the same language you know we share the same visions and uh that's it and and if you bump into me somewhere and i throw you a smile or or whatever like it's because i know exactly what you're thinking because i'm thinking the same thing and i'm absolutely with you so uh that's about it that i mean that's an inspiring story man and i i mean no platitudes with that and for everyone who's tuning in just to sum up that golden kernel of knowledge there you know if you're not already in it just make the jump make it happen that's what i did my story is not as interesting as yours is but i took the same leap of faith and i'm really happy that i did and for anyone else who's here i'm sure that they've done something similar and if you haven't maybe it's time that you should so matt i'd love for you to tell everyone you know where can people find your products uh what do you what so here's the deal we're dropping some fire sunset sherbert right now uh we're dropping 7 10 i'll be at local joint with a bunch of bunch of rosin um the following week we're going to drop apple fritter and runs flower across the valley um but yeah guys we're in the [ __ ] drought right all right so show up early wait good news we just harvested a whole room of amazing o.g and give us a few weeks on that and uh yeah that's gonna be some fire um but let me just tell you man thank you for for getting in the industry because your presses kill it for us they changed the game for us no question and um you got to keep that going when everyone depends on you guys for the new and upcoming tech i mean that's that's all you it shouldn't be underrated how hard it is to do that you got to deal with all the extractors all day i do not envy you one iota um you know i don't envy you on iota but you're killing it and uh you know we're pressure for life man uh we're with you guys and thank you support and you know uh as this stream comes to an end because i'm sure everyone's probably bored with us i just wanted to be saying um i did want to thank everybody who uh who uh signed on to listen to me ramble a little bit um and just thank them uh you know so very very much and uh i know that it's really tough in the world right now um and i'm thinking about all you guys the [ __ ] keeps me up at night so uh let me know if i can do something to help you all out i know i've thrown around my email address a lot it's matt i got my email address a lot it's matt m-a-t-t at growthsciences.com throw me an email uh jump on the phone whatever and uh i love you guys more than you know i really do so uh thank you guys for everything yeah that is a true mark of ownership uh thank you matt for joining us can't wait to talk some more hopefully we see you again in vegas at mj biz if it is safe to do so i kind of doubt it right now but we will see what happens uh and for everyone who's tuned in we got some really big stuff coming up later this summer keep an eye out for some new teasers that we're gonna be dropping uh some new technology covering everyone's way can't wait to share with you two matt you guys are gonna be stoked so we got some big new stuff coming out soon thanks for everything man i really appreciate you inviting me on this is pretty cool like it's really cool hey my pleasure love to champion our you know really our top customers all of our customers and just people that have good perspectives in the

[Music] you", "Wwy0yvQkMO0": "[Music] what a guy's welcome to the CCC I'm Shane and I'm Danny we're back again for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 laughs and this stuff looks fire man the rosin we've been getting our hands on has been super fire and it's a treat today we've got the doctor ladybug GMO flower to compare directly to one of the best representations of the concentrate that's a pretty rare that we get the chance to sometimes it's like we get a certain type of hats whether it be a particular strain and then we're able to try the flower sometime down the line or we may have tried it previously it's pretty rare to have a sample of some flour and some concentrate of the exact same cultivar for us you know lately but we have been smoking this GMO a lot we've been thinking about doing a review for you guys like we just haven't gotten around to do it yet we're good but we figured we kind of throw a little mini review of this in with this GMO rosin that was press Peron does it say what micron bubble hash this was I don't believe that I assume it's like nine here ones one or 73 so basically GMO the strain itself is a cross between chem dog and Girl Scout cookie as you guys know if you've been watching this channel for any length of time that we are huge chem dog fans this particular Cross Lanes super heavily on the chem dog side which is something I like hold on when you look at the smell the structure it's definitely super kendo Oh God that is crazy every time I dab GMO lately I'm just like what the hell it's like it's almost like it gives you a little heartburn it's so pungent I didn't think we could give you heartburn in a good way but it's just got that like back in the throat huh oh wait it's like a real really big it's not like a plunging like sour like fruity or like a diesel II smell it's very like dick and musk it almost like coffee you know coffee is like a really big yeah smell but this is more like a Sharpie turb kinda like I mean down there's a lot of hints of a lot of different kind of complex smells and flavors and Terps going on in here but I've been a huge fan of this weed since the first time I tried it and any time I can get my hands on a good batch like this dr. ladybug I usually do you got to try that robot really high but it's almost like that it's a little bit much a very high but it's not a bad jittery it's just like that I need to reduce them you know say like I need to go be active it's very cerebral in the head that it's also got a big body part it's almost yes it's definitely gonna lean heavier on the indica side in the normal sense of like what you think indica means as far as being relaxing superbee this strain is super good for pain relief but it's not like a knockout smoke it's not gonna you know make you super sleepy it's functional but it does have a lot of the good traits that we tend to think of as traditional yeah indica traits as far as the good pain relief appetite stimulant for me personally this has been a great like all-around daytime throughout the day any time of day textmode yeah honestly yeah again I hate the whole indica sativa thing kinda as far as from a marketing standpoint because I like like I said I like to judge everything as I hit it this one's honestly hit me like right in minute like you said it's a it's a everyday smoke morning noon or night to me it's pretty it resembles a hybrid to me I don't know what they're really calling it I realize it's kind of the best of both worlds yes it's the best of all worlds got me very creative but not too sleepy not too jittery so yeah I mean I love the high on it honestly it's really nice this stuff came to us as like a really tacky shatter almost and it buttered up from over 90 yeah those guys can see the close-ups it started off completely translucent thank you like you would see it pretty much right after it was pressed you know it stayed temperature controlled and you know they did a good job getting that from beginning processed the way they wanted to live it to the end consumer and then what we do with it on our end is on us yeah you know we kept it out we didn't put in the fridge or whatever it's completely buttered up now but when we took the close-ups yesterday a look incredible we goofed it guys we does n't matter literally this whole of joggers getting smoked in less than what 12 hours right you know so I'm not really too concerned with it but yeah I can already tell by smelling this it's an exaggerated version of that I'm expecting it to taste like an exaggerated version of that we'll find out yeah I'm gonna go out and I'm popping this jar on the dr. ladybug GMO so and I wanted to bring up that it smells very garlicky and I know that there's like garlic breath up there I know there's garlic cookies and others GMO cookies I'm not really quite sure they all smell they're very similar but this right here is the loudest and most garlic theme of them all this shit's got me super scrambled but this right here is the most garlicky all mo raw it doesn't just taste like that smells o3 airs I got even a smoke kind of smelled like that smoke smells amazing a little treat I couldn't hold back I'm gonna go home and we're going on longer for this right here so this is the kind of [ __ ] I don't care what the [ __ ] haters out there say this is the [ __ ] that deserves a little review oh so far this is so far the bug right here it's it's definitely you know I think it leaves more on the chem side it's definitely got that dirty feet funky fuelie fuming I don't know the best way to describe is just that funk that canvas where I got the word pom-pom when I yeah funky weed it usually has some Cameron this stuff this straight funky dirt I can we're getting the really good Kennedy from up north and then they kind of 91 chem over it's Ann Curry's the creme Buchanan for a while when we first got our medical carts back in the day that's definitely what I look for I'm looking for those nostalgic funky root Bewley crazy gassy Terps with the chemicals that takes me back to that a day you know and with this weed right here the reason we've been smoking this on us lately is because it's exactly what I want is this as far as the body smell it takes just the overall enjoyment when I smoke this yeah this is the exact same thing alright guys sorry gonna take a little halftime break there I guess this stuff the buzz on it is a little more strong than we were intending it's kind of like kind of like an OG it just kind of keeps going up and you don't know where the ceilings gonna be because I'm pretty high right now I take no more dad and then we're gonna rate this [ __ ] oh you're going in for that second Devon yeah I just got this so long I got a good one on a second one yeah it's a rarity for you these days I'd really like to take two in one video especially two bangers so that should tell you guys right there's something about this [ __ ] right here some day it's like the type of stuff were like you're already where you want to be but you end up I'm just smoking more just because you want to taste it I just need to flavor again and the flavors that's a real thing right sometimes you smoke because you want to smoke you want the field you know you want to feel I might as well let's just be honest yeah but then there's some times where you're already where you exactly where you want to be and I still want to smoke more it's because you just want to taste it I I'm stealing your gone I'm gonna take one of these blowing it up with two nice well my timers hitting this so we're just gonna race the music up in the window yeah this stuff is really smooth though it doesn't make it expands your arms and it makes you cop a little bit if you know what's on my first step there wasn't much of a cop this stuff is really smooth for some rosin so I'm digging feel like there's been a lot of tins being given out lately yes what do you think it's another one yeah goodness I don't do up the DJ Khaled oh no then another ten honestly there's some stiff competition on this string and I'm gonna say that I've had one representation that was a little bit better it was the Papa Berkeley it wasn't rosin but it was GMO it was full milk but it tasted just a little better than this I'm not gonna lie and there's some stiff competition so you know I feel like our ratings have to get a little bit stiffer I'm giving this one a nine point five everything's tens the flavor just to be a a bit more little more that stuff I remember that as some of the best bubble hat I've seen this year sure it's crazy it's crazy a time football mashup in this browser but I promise you if you tried both of them I think you would agree and yeah I don't know man I haven't find I would like to see someone make yeah I don't know if you could make better rosin from that bubble than this right here you know I'm saying yeah this to me is about you it's about as good as it gets because then the flavor on this is already crazy to me and the flavor on this was just like a slightly more exaggerated cleaner version of this and I like this dream because it it's one of those strains that tastes almost exactly the way it smells so like kind of gives you that he like ride the whole progress I've like smelling it breaking it down packing it is smoking it and it's like you get the smell and then you get the taste and there's like brings it full circle bias in there it's personal opinion all right for sure I tried that at cauliflower and it was the first time I actually dabbed GMO extract that could be playing on it could be the first time I just got that crazy GMO term and extract form but you know what this stuff is amazing I'm still giving this stuff a 95 percent rating so that's pretty good they built a and this stuff is awesome pickups in 710 labs now and they are killing it right Sutton standards definitely so I'm seeing from you know watching them out in Colorado when we were out there and you know seeing what they were doing out there and then watching what the way they've been able to transition out here and what they've done in the last like year and a half two years has been really cool to watch nothing up some 710 labs for sure yeah and we're far frozen they definitely smoke graves I think so I mean we're definitely going to have to get great be with them I love them linked up with smoked tons of curve GBP Swisher's all day do all the stuff down there that you're supposed to do right now like like comment subscribe turn on notifications hit the bill do that little thing yeah and let us know what your favorite purple strain of all time let's do it right now brilliant I'll be back next week with another one of these doing the same thing yeah same table same guys whatever different we though what's your name Shane mine Dan mm-hmm later see you know what just a plain row always give my day on all night but I'm the running back jet and you know I'm gonna run all know we have fun for the right price turning the Friday night we're going 18 dummy to the sunrise no wise from the dank smoke but I run a reserve with my tank for what we just trying to have some fun", "_BnAbBlMJwQ": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas somali a I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for a cannabis extract review I'm really excited that we have cannabis extracts back in Canada and that I have some great friends who are making them growing them with their allowed for plants and sharing them legal rosin how cool is that if you were here from the start of the channel you'll remember that I used to do all my pairings with extracts and only extracts and as soon as legalization happen ox ox 17 20 18 I shifted to reviewing legal cannabis just to make sure that I was playing within all the rules now we've come to a point where we could finally have these craft extracts again and some of these producers from that legacy market I'm lucky to have built friendships with and have them share phenomenal phenomenal products with me which is great I love legalization in Canada super super cool what's the first one we are going to try I have two today we're gonna do two of these new reviews and see how they go I was just in Vancouver for lifting coke conference and I was finally able to meet a very cool gentleman I had done quite a few reviews of his rosin in the past and it was really great to finally meet it's melt season if you're from the show I did a lot of great things about season he has a phenomenal rosin maker it does a lot of collabs with a lot of big wonderful companies in Canada so we have our label says Sunday driver 120 you let's just break that down a little bit so Sunday driver is a genetic from can urato genetics that went to jungle boys and that's where it became really really popular as soon as it was jungle boy then it was one of these really big hype strains and what is the build of it it is fruity pebble OG from alien genetics and then a grape pie and has just all these wonderful fruits and gases and all that great stuff all the Terps that really really like our in here so I've been waiting to open this and make sure that I opened it and could review it so that's the strain we have the producer melt season and then you can see that it says 120 you and if you're not familiar with hashes or Rosen's especially hash Rosen's or hashes that might make absolutely no sense to you and when we're making hash there are silk screen sizes generally they start 190 hundred and fifty and then you get to the Year 120 you and your 90 you then you have a seventy five a sixty a 50 and a twenty five but or seventy three you sorry but that 122 ninety you section of screening is where you get the most mature heads so your 120 you and this is just as I assume this is just a straight 120 you pull of this very specific a lot of people blend their 93 you and their 120 you to get a larger output but very interesting to see the 120 you and I'd really like to do some tasting differences to see if a 93 you would taste different than a 120 you because of the size of the glandular head would be very very interesting experiment to find out so you can see in the bottom we've got a nice wet delicious rosin nice and white absolutely fantastic let's dig in to the nose you can see there I'll get a nice closer video you can see how bright and white it is I believe this is a keyword hash rosin hmm and on the nose the first layer is like this almost creamy herbaceous gas that could only be related to hmm this one's quite confusing cuz it's very complex there's a layer of white flowers there's a layer of gas there's a layer of skunk there's a layer of Rudy miss mmm absolutely delicious super complex which is great and just kind of wet we'll break it up a little with my dab tool here and see if that'll release an aroma so I can really get on point with those mmm if I was gonna relate it to something it would be almost sweet lemongrass petrol some very fresh delicious earth that has some fruits some tree fruits some black and red tree fruits falling in it some plum some blackberry some blueberry but very creamy as well hmm very interesting aromas but a medium plus exaggeration of area it's a medium plus expression of the aroma sorry for my stutter very delicious smells very fresh smells very nice and knew and loved for so I've got my puff go peak here we're gonna load it in the puff Co peak and see how it tastes we'll get that big of a dab in there but a Bing C it is it's a big one but it's not a small one or it's a small one and a big one anyways let's put make sure this is on the right temperature we're gonna put it on medium on green and let's fire it up this is really great to be able to go back and do these types of videos I'm really excited to be putting out more bras in education more hash education because there's a lot of verbiage and vocabulary in there that gets quite confusing so already this lesson on 120 u-verse 93 is fantastic hmm it really translates well I have a quartz insert in here but the flavor really translates well from what I was smelling that creamy lemongrass there's a taste of ginger there's some citrus there's some petrol it's very mouth coating it's very mouth filling and delicious how can you complain about something like that big vapor clouds on green tasty confectionery a little bit of herbs gas everything that you could really ask for in cannabis I guess that's why this genetic is so famous sent to a very famous extractor why it's made its way around the world I totally understand I really like the sunday driver thank you melt season for the wonderful gift I really appreciate it I hope for anybody watching we helped to clarify a few things I should mention that this hash was made from cured cannabis so it's not a live rosin but it's just a hash rosin absolutely fantastic make sure like comment share and most importantly subscribe so you can see all the new videos coming out always working on lots of content I'm really excited to share it with you guys till next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "qXQTtjIjZ0U": "alright y'all how everyone's doing good today and in this video we're gonna be talking about rosin more specifically at least in this video we'll kind of talk about half rosin because really rosin is just heat pressure and canvas and really it's not that difficult to explain but when it comes to harsh rosin it's definitely a lot more complex and you can get a lot of different results light rosin with hash rosin you still need good herb but at the same time you can never judge a book by it's cover because at least when it comes to water hash and hash rosin you may not get the best yield if the bud you know looks super try come--and super frosty and all that you make like you may not actually get the best yield for all you know you may get a better yield from a bud that looks okay and it's kind of crazy with hash rosin because this process is so much more complex it actually costs you a lot more as well I mean it depending on the grade of the half-frozen it can be anywhere from like 80 to 140 dollars my obvious that's a big range but with cannabis there's a lot of different qualities so as for the two types of hash that they use for hash rosin it's ice water hash which most which really more than likely I'd say probably 99.9% of the time hash makers are going to be using ice water hash for their hash rosin but the other one is dry sift and that is basically just kind of you know the classic way of getting patched they take a drum that has a screen on the bottom or they have just a big-screen table and they basically just you know break down the buds and they just sift out the hash it's kind of like Keith yeah but in this case because the trichome heads and the glands are a lot more intact and because it's so fresh it's definitely gonna be more like hash because when you pick it up it's definitely gonna be a lot more sticky than it would be if you were to handle this Keith because it's been dried and cured and also until it you guys know what ice water hash is is it's basically putting all of your plant material into a washing machine with ice and water and then it just switches it all around you could some people use Wars or paddles other people use automated systems that just do it all it's itself which honestly is pretty cool I haven't actually seen one in person but these machines are crazy they can go counter clockwise or clockwise and you can set it for it to make two or three revolutions and then go the other way it's it's kind of crazy honestly and with ice water hash you're able to break off those trichome heads a lot more consistently because the way they agitate the buds and the plant material it does it so where it gets a almost perfect every time and then thus going into the filtration process it goes through micron bags which filters out all the plant material and the higher the micron number the more open the holes are and then the lower you go the more tighter than mesh gets there are different hash makers that make a 9bu a 73 and a full-spectrum but more than likely in that full spectrum they're not going to be using that 73 or the 19 I can just tell you that and then if you were really to only get just a single micron hash you really won't get as taste or full-spectrum effect out of it which is the reason why a lot more people like to use full-spectrum hash in order to make their hash process because that taste and the effect translates over so for most full-spectrum hash it's going to be anywhere between 145 to about the 25 range but really those ranges can all depend on the hash maker themselves because the highest amount is really not gonna get you a good yield and the very lowest amount will not get you a good yield at all really because by the time the wash gets down there goes pretty much little to nothing because really between the 70 to 90 micron range is really where you get most of your yield about 70 percent of it and a lot of hash makers they will just take off some of the top ones and the bottom ones and then use kind of everything else in between the reasoning for this is because with the 145 like 150 range even higher the look of it is a lot more green because it has a lot more of the bigger plant material in there so it's obviously not gonna look the best because people are more so looking for a like wider looking crumbly consistency and that's really where you get it from the 70 to 90 range so it's more than likely that they're not including every single micron bag that they use but if they're only doing so in order to maintain quality so like I was saying before how some strains don't really wash as well there's actually a test that some hash makers do it's basically just using a mason jar and putting in a half ounce of flour then ice and water and then kind of mixing it all around if you see the Tri cone heads fall off then you got some good but but if you see them kind of breaking off or the stock kind of breaking off halfway then it's not typically what you're looking for and of course most of the time these hash makers are going to be using live products and live basically means as soon as a flower is harvested they throw it right into a freezer basically or they just freeze it at sub-zero temperatures so it keeps all of the terpenes it keeps all of the cannabinoids and everything else intact as much as possible because if you were to just let it sit out and cure you will be losing most of that taste and the effect so I didn't even realize that there were even more forms of rosin there is a mechanical separation which basically is still rosin they've just extracted some THC a crystals from or they extracted the THC a which turned into THCA crystals and there you go so it's almost looks like a nice like sappy rosin with some diamonds in there which is kind of crazy I'll probably show you guys a picture somewhere because I got it I got this off of High Times as far as this article goes so so I thought the High Times for interviewing for pretty knowledgeable hash makers and providing us with this knowledge and the other method is called jar tech which basically makes the rosin look like a sauce and it's kind of crazy because I don't even know that I mean I mean know that rosin can come in different consistencies like that and then for you to make a rosin and then turn it into a sauce that's pretty cool so I think that's pretty much all that I wanted to talk about at least for rosin anyway if you guys can get your hands on it definitely try it out it is it can't well I mean it can be pretty expensive like I said it can be anywhere from 80 to 140 done 40-plus dollars so if you are able to find some for a good price hopefully not too cheap because you know sometimes the prices are too good to be true but you're able to find some good half-frozen definitely go out there and go try it and I'm also not promoting any underage or you know illegal use but yeah but you know if you found this video helpful you don't be sure to like subscribe comment do all that good stuff and actually today is Friday so every Friday we actually do a canned verse Asian at 4:20 p.m. Pacific Standard Time where me and the community have a conversation about the various topics that are the cannabis industry as well as they asked me their cannabis related questions and me as you are maybe cannabis consultant will do my best to answer them it's already all if I don't see you in a few hours then I'll see you on the next video juice you [Music]", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's the big trip guys this is our vinyl that's going on our new distribution spreader bands you see a rendering of what this stuff looks like over here on the computer we got on vinyl and graphics right here at the next measure factory but you'll see these out now I'm starting at Southern California and then you'll start to see it in the rest of the country hey guys check it out this one one of our many pioppi cards that you'll see at a lot of retailers starting here in Southern California then across the nation has all of our products on it all the units they all work on it's kind of the ultimate smash lab that tells you about everything see so this is a what a lot of the retailers where you see like our units this is what they're gonna have and then the other side it has the sifter and it's accessories tells you all about that whatnot so check out hydro store smoke shops and other stores in your areas dealers retailers in your areas that carry an egg Smasher product [Music] [Music] got the bag all loaded up here bottle textile the reason that we do that you can see the bottom how its folded in the two corners are inverted we reason we do that as it holds the proper surface area so we can get a consistent measurement every time so we know how much pressure to put on this thing so that's how it's measuring the touch of measuring the bottle textile via the surface area so if you don't fold it right load the bag right you're not gonna have a proper surface or any of you to know inconsistent results so tip of the day the surface area of model Tech's top [Music] [Music] do [Music] you [Music] [Music]

believe and this is a wax that actually had on a previous video I wanted to do a video based on this product alone out of the four grams that we picked up from that one video but yeah this is the only one that I picked up the rest was Randy's but this one stuck out this was $36 a gram and it says live rosin you guys can see it you're gonna be using my trusty utility in five which has been good to me just show you what this look like so it says right off the bat you got the live rosin right there I mean it's big a sticker the brand is 1111 which is I guess the time I know eleven eleven supposed to be in like when it's that time you supposed to make make a wish or some [ __ ] whatever I don't know but you can see right here they consider it a rosin Jam and the strain is orange creamsicle rosin you know I've had a few videos on my channel where I've made some rosin rosin is basically when you squish with heat and pressure with the nuts and then on the sides it seeps out all the oils that are actually in the nug and this one's live rosin lunch I've had live rosin before I'm not sure what they do to make live rosin but if I were to guess it was they probably freeze it's basically the way that they make live resin but instead of making live resin and like running it through BHO they squish it after freezing the the dried material I could be wrong so if any of you guys know please correct me in the comments below let's just open this game so I already smelled this I've really know the smell and everything I've actually tasted it in that video and what this gave off was that salt lemon line like Mexican candy like smell but when you take a hit it definitely tastes like that and much more it's like a fresher I don't know how to describe it but I mean just it's a bit darker than I my rosin would be because I've had 7/10 labs before and you guys know like that's just you know the apex when it comes to Rosen's and all that I mean it's not bad you know but doesn't look like it's worth now it was but then again looks can be deceiving see just how good this is my trusty Dan tool so as usual I'm gonna take a hit blow it into a camera and then we're gonna see by blowing it into the light how much I actually take because I know me hitting a beep in is not like the most prettiest sight I know there's no thing where you can see it fill up which is I pleasing you know but as long as I could blow him to life and prove to you then I'm not taking small eyes just so right at the back consistency it's a very stringy [Music] very stringy but I feel like this is much easier to pack on she's here that's worth it to have we I also got some tea well yeah so I had a rough night yesterday well not a rough night you know I was just like in drinking and smoking till about 5:00 a.m. and I woke up at 11:00 so you can see my hair is all [ __ ] up but disregard that Cheers so you could definitely taste like that lemon salt paste but there's like a orange freshness to that hit and I'm I'm guessing it's because its life rosin and basically most of the Terps that are from the original plant is still in there and it makes it gives us a unique taste I don't know how to describe it but initially based on looks I was kind of upset even though the budtender she did help us and she said that was fire it is fire never like you know it based on looks itself it looked like some [ __ ] brown ass pho but I was definitely wrong and uh yes different good stuff so I'm taking another hit for you guys blow it into the light we're talking a call in a video hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately and you know I've been doing like in five four or five videos a week which is a pretty good scheduled for me I don't have to you know stress too much about getting a video on every day it's been like four or five weeks where I've been live-streaming consecutively so be sure to check those out on Tuesday hammer talked about hey Cheers the taste is unreal like it's definitely like then tastes like weed but it you can def it so it's a weird weird taste but I I think I've [ __ ] enjoy it it's not like your typical salt lime taste that I've seen from others like products and stuff and other strains like that Clementine from friendly farms they say exactly like that but this one just adds to something more to it I'm not too sure what it is but it could be just because it's live rosin not too sure if I'm adding million all right hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music]", "p7xm9Y8P-Y8": "don't y'all just [ __ ] love it when you wake up to the perfect funny Roy sent me that challenge like two days ago right before it blew up but I was gonna do one just completely spaced it and I woke up this morning to that and it killed me so [

unknown Terp and Tobiah Minzy Bobby both are producing cash so we're gonna get to tour their facility which is something I'm really really hyped on I think the only other hash facility move toward is Bo's down in Southern Oregon always such an awesome thing to see where they produce the hash because it's so different from pho where you have all these big cylinders and you can't really see what's going on no the hash you can just pop your head right on into those rosin presses and see what the [ __ ] being squirted out there I gotta get up I took the coldest shower ever this morning so I'm

system to you know really try to form a uniform canopy this isn't probably the best example of the uniform canopy but this is more like what we go to fill you know and pretty much on the top and each one of these little squares and have as many jobs as possible you know periods are really uniform you've been holy [ __ ] it smells insane in here people these are huge yeah yeah yeah let me see your

eats their own eats their own oh let's keep tipping that banger oh guys cushman's constellation cannabis sub x another eight out of ten this one [Music] flavor processing all of it's at least a seven out of eight [Music] high not all that strong nice chill i still nothing to put you for you down but i give it like a six maybe seven seven for a high it's cool though i like it i'm chill i can talk to you i mean you guys can see in previous videos how much cannabis influences me when i smoke it uh sometimes i don't see that in other people i've been smoking for years like just 74 since i was 13 35 now you know it's funny you should just get high still good and stuff am i in my 30s man everything started changing like let me know if you guys noticed this stuff like you guys ever smoke so long that you notice years later like oh damn the strain or the way it was grown now don't get me wrong strains all have independent terpenes and the effects but when we have people that are always pulling things early or not pushing the plant to its full potential it's just kind of like you're only getting some of the psychoactiveness that comes with it you only get like that uh high anxiety like heart race [Music] everybody's like oh it's a sativa sometimes it's it's not probably seven times out of ten it's not even if it is a sativa i mean there's sativas that will space you out so hard and you won't know what hit you and there's sativas that will make your heart race and make you think you're having a heart attack [Music] but when the plant's grown and the resin isn't to its full potential in full maturity um you start getting those lesser desired effects in my opinion i personally like heads that are a little more amber in color because that's when you know they're good today we're getting a lot of heads that are clear and white and you're seeing that super white beach sand bubble hash or the [ __ ] super gold bubble house or the super light in color almost white level hatch and aussie let's do [Music] uh prachum not maturing and honestly it's okay i mean some flavor comes out better that way in some aspects but you know you kind of why not drop some of what you like but you get full uh full spectrum full grown uh full time or full sun full term plants wow that's a different experience man uh you want to talk about getting stoned i mean that's what that's what put you down this is very good though nice chill i like it just kind of cruising to the music but yeah that's my thoughts in my experience with all that uh do one more tab with y'all i mean i can't really get enough of this stuff it's just you just want to eat it it's like tasty terps [Music] all right turbans little turbans i don't think i'm gonna go with the name tarp anymore i don't know why i actually used it uh it's because my dog's name is turt i like saying terp a lot let's go with my old [ __ ] uh nickname smoke uh so i'll be like what up guys it's smoke here to get smoked out or whatever i don't [ __ ] know some [ __ ] like that but it's better using my real name my opinion real name is kade kind of uh doesn't roll off the tongue to me i don't know [ __ ] it [Music] together all right guys hope you have a good rest of your day let's get lifted stay high stay medicated uh [Music] oh baby a little more oh get that banger done let me know if there's a stuff you like about the videos
