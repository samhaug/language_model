{"MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll

"vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "JkSDcNwhijk": "[Music] yeah tastes like weed tastes like gummy bear weed I'm chewing [Music] well I don't feel

definitely gonna hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one trending for a little bit boys

consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini course mini program that dancing walk you through

cbd headquarters hey today i want to try our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "J19-zx7HPB8": "i really gotta stop giving y'all such an easy like goal to stop damaging my body warning chili dilly is a trained professional do not attempt anything you see on this page what is going on people of earth my name is chilly dilly back at you with another dip ass video and in today's video i foolishly told you guys on the delta egg cart review that if you gave me 15 likes that i would eat this whole [ __ ] pack of edibles right here 200 milligrams of delta eight okay you guys obviously got it literally the first day and i'm gonna stop making such easy light goals for you guys um because you guys are [ __ ] awesome obviously that's why you're killing it uh we're gonna eat all this i mean there's nothing else to say effect send me these um shout out to them i'm just doing this because why not [ __ ] it right i'm probably not gonna eat them individually so i'll see them all okay uh yeah i have eaten three delta edibles before and all it did was just make me really lazy so i imagine 10 is just gonna make me dumb lazy i'm just gonna get really tired all right well let's get these open i'm trying i'm just trying to get right into this man honestly see what the [ __ ] these look like i'm really not happy about their candy because i just don't like candy that like sour candy and [ __ ] it's not a big fan of that honestly they smell fine honestly supposed to be um [Music] strawberry mango green apple which i hate green apple blueberry razz and mystery and i already off rip see like three [ __ ] green apples so that's cool bro honestly uh let's just go ahead and get into this man if you guys are new here make sure you like comment subscribe man we're trying to get we're so close to a thousand green apple terrible um but yeah make sure you subscribe all right good job we're so close to a thousand man i'm so pumped i'm so happy never in my life did i think i was gonna have a thousand subscribers on youtube i always wanted it but here's the blue raj of course that's delicious so i 2500 milligrams of delta 9 thc and uh i it was all candy and it was so much candy definitely go back and watch that video um there was it was just so much gummy candy and it made me sick like all that gummy candy so i'm going in here hoping to god that i don't get sick if you guys are dabbing smoking eating whatever the [ __ ] you doing to adjust the lovely thc do let me know in the comments um yeah i definitely don't recommend you eat a whole bag of edibles i definitely doubt they didn't tell me to do it obviously i doubt they'd even want me to do that but [ __ ] it the mango is good damn this kind of reminds me of those uh those scooby snacks remember the gummy scooby snacks that were super fire i mean i think you can still get them but um it reminds me a lot of that to be honest this is mystery they got little triangles on them no no no i wasn't good all right oh that's true strawberry not bad so man so if you guys have ever watched my edible challenges i'll generally just eat all these wait an hour come back to you it's gonna be the same thing all right now i was gonna roll up a joint for right now but um i think for the first hour i want to see just how i feel off these before i smoke just regular just so i can give you a clear answer and then go smoke i guess that's like the responsible thing to do i don't know i don't [ __ ] we might have to come back early and smoke all right all the edibles are [ __ ] done the mystery was garbage green apple garbage but i hate green apple if you guys like green apple let me know man that's crazy because i do not drink some water all right man we are going to come back in an hour see how we feel um i'm a little nervous to be honest because i've never eaten this many edibles on delta a um but i do feel like my tolerance is high enough it's only 200 milligrams like the whole pack is only 200 milligrams so that's why i don't really think it's that big a video to be honest so yeah all right we will be back in an hour boys all right one hour later all right boys it's been about an hour and a half now maybe a little over off of the whole bag of edibles and um you know man i will say i do feel a little high i will definitely say that i feel pretty focused man if anything like i had heard some people say that and i was like okay but i feel pretty focused man and honestly uh i just wanna smoke me a bowl right now and uh just share with you guys so i'm feeling pretty good about an hour and a half got some [ __ ] done around the house did all that [ __ ] sorry cheers so yeah man if you guys have ever eaten uh delta edibles let me know in the comments um i've just been big chilling right now too my cat's over here chilling my dog downstairs is chilling uh yeah it's been pretty fun man honestly i don't ever recommend that people do that i will say that though i don't condone it even though it's legal i still don't condone it okay all right man well like i said i'm feeling pretty good i edited a video did some [ __ ] around the house gonna chill around with the pets uh let me get you a shot at the pets this is scully she's on a pet couch right now she's pretty tired man she's been playing all day she's been growing up this is butters by the way our cat she's very cute yeah all right boys uh i guess i'll check in in another hour and a half

been like another hour and a half uh yeah i think i'm gonna end the video here now i feel completely fine uh if anything i'm hungry honestly anytime i have smoked delta it has made me really hungry i also did smoke uh you know some regular delta nine so that also mixed with it so um overall it wasn't bad experience at all honestly it wasn't hard kind of chill um i got a lot of [ __ ] done was pretty focused i thought i'd maybe be able to i just like sit down and watch movies all day sorry i just sit down and watch movies all day no did all my [ __ ] still kind of high gonna eat some food and now i'm gonna go watch some movies uh yeah so i'm gonna end the video here guys thank you so much for watching remember to like comment subscribe all that good [ __ ] and i will see you guys in the next video all right man be safe [Music] [ __ ]", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "saNb3mEjFG8":

This Is What Happened To His Spinal Cord. GC is a 55 year old man, presenting to the\nemergency room with a broken hip. His daughter Kaycee tells the admitting nurse\nthat GC had been moving kind of funny over the last few months. She heard a loud thud in the stairwell, as\nher dad cried out \u201cHelp!! I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d Earlier in his life, GC didn\u2019t pay attention\nto his health. When he was younger, he had some problems. His classmates made fun of him because he\nwas bigger than everyone else, and so he withdrew in to his food. He developed in to an adult who couldn\u2019t\ncontrol himself, as his family found him hoarding excess food, and secretly eating every last\nbit. In his 30s, GC had health problems. He had diabetes and gout. His big toe would hurt all the time. \u2028As the years passed, GC started losing\nfeeling in his hands and feet because of his diabetes. One day he stepped on something sharp. It cut his foot, and he didn\u2019t realize anything\nhad happened until he saw red puddles in the shower. He realized he couldn\u2019t keep living like\nthis. One doctor he saw wanted to start him on a\nvariety of medicines. He refused after looking online and found\na doctor who recommended and would do gastric bypass surgery. This doctor would cut in to his abdomen. They\u2019d create a small pocket of his stomach. Then, they would reroute his GI tract in to\nthe end of his small intestines. The small stomach pouch limited the amount\nhe\u2019d eat, so that he\u2019d feel full while eating less food. And the reroute would limit the amount of\ncalories he\u2019d absorb. After surgery, doctors warned GC that he would\nneed to control his nutrients, because the bypass can cause some deficiencies in vitamins\nand minerals. GC\u2019s diabetes cleared up, but he started\nredirecting his excess habits. GC started getting cocky with his health. Fixing his diet, made his blood sugar control\nbetter. Those doctors, were trying to pump me full\nof meds for my diabetes, but I fixed it myself, he thought. 2 years ago, GC caught the flu. This was the sickest he had been since changing\nhis life. He vowed to never get ill again, and started\nreading online forums about boosting immunity. He remembered doctors telling him he might\neventually have vitamin and mineral deficiency because of his gastric bypass. He came across some online videos that told\nhim zinc and vitamin C were absolutely the best ways to keep the immune system strong. Everyone in this internet group made it clear\u2014\nthis was undoubtedly the best way to prevent any illness. And it\u2019s simply impossible to take too much\nVitamin C and Zinc because they\u2019re water soluble, meaning that any extras will dissolve\nin the urine and be excreted from the body. And that\u2019s a great guarantee that the kidneys\nwill always catch any extras that the body doesn\u2019t use. He went to the pharmacy and started buying\nas many bottles of zinc and Vitamin C as possible. He joked that he was reliving his past life,\nbut this time was different. Instead of collecting high blood sugar, he\nwas going to collect the strongest immune system ever made by humans. GC started with the combination Zinc / Vitamin\nC gummies. These were delicious, just like candy, without\nthe calories and with only all of the health benefits. If there\u2019s no limits here, might as well\neat the whole bottle, he thought. Anytime GC felt a runny nose or sore throat,\nhe\u2019d eat an extra handful of Zinc Vitamin C gummies. Sometimes the pharmacy would be sold out of\nhis favorite brand of supplement. He read online that denture adhesive cream\ncontained zinc. And, if it was good enough for grandma to\nput in her mouth, then it was good enough for him to eat as a zinc immune booster. Anytime he was out of his preferred vitamin\nbrand, he\u2019d eat a tube of denture cream instead. 4 Months ago, GC started feeling a numbness\nin his hands and feet. But it wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t feel anything\nanymore, it was that all he could feel were pins and needles, like his hands had fallen\nasleep, but the pricks were 100 times more intense, all the time. He had experienced this earlier in his life\nand thought it was familiar, but it wasn\u2019t. This was on top of him losing his sense of\ntaste. His sides would start hurting. Sometimes it\u2019d pulse, and he\u2019d feel like\nthrowing up. But he was usually able to keep it all down. One day, Kaycee noticed her dad was walking\nkind of funny. She asked him about it but he didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was talking about. Everything seemed to be ok, and he told her,\ndon\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s fine, as he chewed on more Zinc Vitamin C gummies. As the days passed, the pin pricks and the\npain in his sides started intensifying. He had trouble not only walking, but also\nstanding. And finally when one day he struggled to walk\ndown a flight of stairs, he fell. Instantly, he knew something was wrong with\nhis hip as he cried out for help, and he\u2019s brought to the emergency room where we are\nnow. At examination, doctors find that GC is alert,\nand oriented. He was clearly in pain, but he was coherent. His brain\u2019s in tact, so maybe he really\ndid just slip. Doctors\u2019 main focus was to fix his broken\nhip. And surgery appears to go smoothly. GC is going to need physical therapy, but\nsomething\u2019s wrong. A blood test finds that GC\u2019s red blood cells\nare larger than normal, called macrocytosis. They cant ask him to stand because he just\nhad hip surgery. But they find that the reflexes in his arms\nare more responsive than normal. His arms were also weaker than normal. His feet had some trouble sensing vibrations. And his daughter confirmed that this had been\nhappening for at least a few weeks. Since he was alert and oriented when he presented\nto the emergency room, then it means that his brain is fine. But reflexes in the arms go through the spinal\ncord. Feeling certain things in the feet also happen\nin the brain, but those impulses have to go through the spinal cord. All of this indicating that maybe he didn\u2019t\njust slip by accident, but that something is actually wrong with GC\u2019s spinal cord. And because he has a history of gastric bypass,\nthen that problem could be caused by a vitamin deficiency. Another blood test finds that GC\u2019s Vitamin\nB12 levels are on the lower end of normal. B12 is needed by the body to help the mitochondria\nin the cells make energy. It\u2019s also needed to make DNA, explaining\nhis big red blood cells. Without enough Vitamin B12, the nerves start\nto get damaged. And cells don\u2019t form properly because DNA\nparts aren\u2019t being made. Nerve damage explains why he fell while his\nbrain\u2019s mostly in tact, because his gastric bypass surgery didn\u2019t allow him to properly\nabsorb nutrients, the doctors thought. They gave him some vitamin B12 injections\nto fix this, even though it seemed to be borderline. He got better, and he was discharged as his\ncondition started to improve. When he heard about having B12 deficiency\nin the hospital, GC took this as instructions to double down on all vitamins and minerals. He needed another boost to his immune system\nanyways, because hospitals are dirty places, so might as well eat even more Zinc Vitamin\nC gummies to prevent any infections that could be from the hospital. As the days passed with after several hundred\nZinc Vitamin C gummies, GC\u2019s side started hurting again. His sense of taste started fading, again. And then Kaycee started to notice he wasn\u2019t\nmaking as much urine as before. GC started acting funny while stammering about\nnot being able to feel his hands and feet. And as Kaycee walks in on her dad in his room,\nshe finds him rolling around on the floor, confused, and he\u2019s brought to the emergency\nroom again. At examination this time, doctors find that\nGC\u2019s kidneys are shutting down. Quickly, they find out that he has calcium\noxalate crystals in the little bit of urine he\u2019s able to make. These crystals don\u2019t dissolve in water,\nand they can build up and stick in to the kidneys, blocking flow, not only causing them\nto fail, but also causing the tubules in the kidneys to necrose. Asking his daughter, what GC\u2019s been eating,\nshe was hesitant to say, because she knew that her dad didn\u2019t trust doctors. She downplayed the Zinc Vitamin C gummies\nand made it seem like he took the daily recommended amount. Peanuts and spinach too have a lot of oxalate\ntoo, and maybe that could be the cause if he ate a lot of it. Maybe he drank antifreeze, or a lava lamp\u2014\nthose get broken down to oxalate too. But this wasn\u2019t his only problem. The nurse noticed that GC\u2019s movements were\nspastic. Neurology consult finds that his reflexes\nin his arms were more exaggerated than normal, and his feeling in his feet was diminished\nagain. All of this looking like Vitamin B12 deficiency\nagain, but something\u2019s wrong. He doesn\u2019t have low B12 levels in his blood,\nand all chemicals associated with vitamin B12 were normal. And while his levels were low when he got\nhis hip surgery last time, they really weren\u2019t low enough to be causing his problems. An MRI of his head was normal, but imaging\nof his spine suggested some kind of neurodegeneration. Specifically, the kind that happens during\na long term Vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide if GC had been doing balloons\nrecently could cause inactivation of vitamin B12 causing deficiency. But this isn\u2019t what happened. He doesnt have a Vitamin B12 problem, and\nhe never did. This same degeneration happens when someone\nhas certain STD\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t seem to have those either. Doctors order another blood test and find\nthat GC has low copper presence in blood. They ask him again about what he eats, and\nthey especially want to know what kind of supplements he takes. And when his daughter hears the question,\nshe finally blurts out about her dad\u2019s excessive Zinc Vitamin C habits, eating hundreds of\ngummies daily and even going so far as to eat Denture Paste to get additional zinc,\nand this tells doctors what they need to know. GC was in kidney failure. Specifically, kidney failure caused by calcium\noxalate. Vitamin C is broken down to oxalate in the\nbody. In massive doses, it COULD cause kidney stones,\nin men. We say \u201ccould\u201d because this comes from\na study involving a questionnaire about taking vitamin C supplements. And those men who said they did take those\nsupplements, had a higher incidence of kidney stones. So is that strong evidence? Maybe. But there is some scientific rationale that\nVitamin C does get broken down to oxalate in humans and that could form a solid crystal\nwith the calcium floating around in the blood, and these crystals can collect in the kidneys. But based on the data we have now, it\u2019s\nnot entirely clear Vitamin C always does this to everyone. There are cases where someone receives a massive\nmegadose of vitamin C in the hospital and then going in to kidney failure hours later\ntoo. But sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt. The risk, and the variable incidence, is enough\nto at least say, don\u2019t eat 100 Vitamin C gummies or tablets everyday, and this could\nbe the cause of GC\u2019s kidney failure.. But kidney failure, wasnt the cause of GC\u2019s\npins and needles feeling in his hands and feet. His kidneys didn\u2019t cause him to walk funny,\nto fall down the stairs and shatter his hip. Kidney failure usually causes build up of\nthings in the blood, because if they were working properly, the kidneys would be filtering\nthings out, so that wouldn\u2019t cause low copper presence in blood. And the kidneys are NOT the reason why part\nof GC\u2019s spinal cord appears to have degenerated, bringing us back to zinc and copper. Both of these are metals. They\u2019re not heavy like mercury or lead,\nand that\u2019s a good thing because it means they\u2019re generally more stable. More stable means less reactive so Zinc and\nCopper are less likely to rip, tear apart and destroy things in the body. Copper and Zinc\u2019s place on the periodic\ntable of elements indicates that they can have a positive 2 charge, positive meaning\nthey\u2019re missing 2 electrons, a particle that creates a negative charge. The body doesn\u2019t like it when things have\ncharges in the body, because that makes them unstable and reactive. And so if copper is plus 2, then it means\nsomething with a negative 2 charge would act on it. On the periodic table, counting back from\nright to left, shows elements that have negative 2 charges, so, they have 2 electrons to give. Oxygen is one of them, and that\u2019s everywhere\nin the body, but it tends to behave in a way that doesn\u2019t give out 2 electrons in this\ncase. Meaning sulfur is the chemical that binds\nto zinc in the body. And because sulfur is in proteins, then this\nstarts to explain all of GC\u2019s problems. Actually, metals reacting with sulfur is a\ncentral idea for why things like lead and mercury are toxic in humans. In the cells of stomach, and the small intestines,\nare proteins called metallothioneins. Metallo referring to metals and thionein deriving\nfrom thio- (\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bf) Greek meaning sulfur. These sulfur rich proteins neutralize metal\nions that come from our diet. In normal function, some copper in the stomach\nand intestines bind metallothionein and get excreted in the feces. The remaining copper gets absorbed in to the\nbody and is used for essential processes. If too much zinc is around, it tells the body\nto make more metallothionein. It has a plus 2 charge too and it\u2019s not\ntoo different from copper, at least from this standpoint. And more metallothionein means that all the\ncopper is inactivated by it and none of it gets absorbed in to be used in the body. This is a problem because the brain is the\nmost copper rich organ in humans. We know the brain needs copper to develop\nproperly, because there\u2019s a disease called Menkes\u2019 Disease, that prevents copper transport\nto the brain in young children because of a genetic mutation. People who have this disease see their brains\ndeteriorate, atrophy, and never fully develop. And most of those patients never live past\nchildhood. All of this explaining GC\u2019s neurologic problems,\nthat he developed since eating excess zinc everyday, it simply forced his body to deplete\nall copper stores, and without copper functioning in the body, the nerves start to degenerate. The damage could be permanent, but we still\ndon\u2019t know exactly how all of this works. If GC is a fully developed adult, and hes\nbeen eating zinc supplements to the tune of hundreds of Zinc Vitamin C gummies daily,\nand going so far as to eat denture paste for additional zinc, then that excess zinc is\ncausing copper deficiency. The solution is to give him to copper, and\ntell him to cut it out with the zinc. You want to take some supplements to boost\nyour immune system then fine, but dont do it by eating denture paste out of the tube. Or by eating whole bottles of gummy vitamins,\nevery day. As the days pass with copper supplementation,\nGC\u2019s condition starts to get better. He\u2019s discharged from the hospital and is\nable to go to physical therapy for his hip. And as he finally learned a lesson about his\nexcess, he made a recovery. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself. And be well.", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it

them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you

another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "ztvQhTfAVgY": "hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "8z5bUfY2fJ4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing roughly eight milligrams of THC and CBD per coming one us our gummies are flavored like strawberry lemonade it is worth noting for diabetics that these gummies are not sugar-free containing sugar pectin and corn syrup the bottle itself is fairly easy to open and is 100% recyclable design for this Ohio medical marijuana edible is appealing with a colorful photo of fruit on the cover and a striking wanna logo inside patients are treated to ten swear gummies crafted into the shape of the THC warning logo the gummies are a deep shade of pink almost like grapefruit and are covered in tasty sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if you've been searching for a good gummy edible be sure not to miss this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or

review on these edibles you guys so this is gonna be a first impression one the other one that i tried was the pink lemonade indica uh gummies from them and i did not like the taste of it it was freaking gross i just felt like the lemon with like the wheat taste did not really it just it was really like bitter so i did not like it so hopefully these ones are better i'm hoping but i'm not gonna lie they still hit like these are definitely really potent i did 50 like in one setting so i took five of these they're each 10 milligrams uh per piece and then it's 100 milligrams thc in there um there are 23 calories per dummy and then they have 2.9 grams of sugar 0.4 grams of protein and 4 milligrams of sodium and then zero cholesterol zero fat no yeah total fat is zero and then saturated fat is zero so i guess that's good um basically the ingredients in here is just like the basic or whatever you know they're not vegan or anything they do have vegan gummies uh from this line uh they're like their nano line but um it's not the one i got i got these ones they were on sale i wanted to try them so yeah and they did smack so i'm gonna open these and we're gonna try them out together [Applause] you guys i'm having such a hard time i don't want to cut them because of the scissors so okay i think we got it i think so stop my dog is like what is this their bag is like hella child proof because i can never get these open like so this is like my thing i just kind of spread it and it always works so okay let's see they smell like mango they definitely smell more sweet it's like orange in the inside let me show you what they look like a piece they're kind of like small they're like small and like kind of like thick thick and they're kind of thick but like they're small and they're coated in sugar and everything this smells like lemon but i don't know how they're going to taste i'm kind of scared but let's try them so this is 10 we're gonna do five and then i will come back and show you guys how high i get in like it says 90 minutes i feel like for me it takes a little bit longer than 90 minutes i don't know why i feel like to hit me a little bit later than that and i'm like [ __ ] stuck so here it goes [Music] [Music] these ones are definitely less bitter than the pink lemonade ones those ones are way more bitter and this one still has a little bit of that aftertaste that you get with edibles so they do have that i feel like the ones other ones that i tried were the smoky ones and they didn't have that bad of like the taste after but it's not terrible but it is there a little bit i know with some you don't really taste them at all so it just really depends so yeah these are the indica ones and they're mango i was kind of excited for these but now that i kind of had them already they're like i wouldn't try this flavor i think i would try something else like a different flavor but [Applause] i just feel like they're not like the best i mean they're good they're potent definitely so i guess that spectrum of it does work out but as far as the taste goes i would give them like a probably like an eight or something like that seven like a seven and a half so i'm gonna have four of these i'm gonna eat one more on camera but i don't think you want to see me eat edibles i mean i guess but i'm just it feels like i'm chewing forever so i'm gonna eat these off camera and then i'll see you guys once i feel the effects and then i will let you guys know how i feel i'm gonna get pretty high i mean i already know this it's already gonna happen so but i will see you guys in a bit br b okay guys i feel like i was kind of bashing the taste with these they're not that bad um but i feel like i still like my smokies edibles a little bit better as far as that weed taste goes that aftertaste is kind of like i guess when you drink some water it'll go away but it's a little much so this is my number three i had the first one on camera i had the second one off camera and i'm gonna have this one with you guys because [Music] like that's the thing with edibles like i just do not like that aftertaste you know like i don't know i kind of feel like this is bad lighting but you guys it is i was gonna film in my car right and then i was gonna film in the living room but i kind of have company over so um i don't wanna do that and then i'm in my room now but and then outside it's so super windy and then in my car i don't really want to sit in my car because honestly i just i don't know i wanted to change it up so i was just like let me just go in my room let me just sit down it's warm because it's super windy outside right now so i just oh my god sorry i got interrupted so these so this is to be my third one and yeah i just decided to do it inside because it's super cold and everything and i just i don't want to be outside it's so windy today like i don't know why it's so windy but it's windy it's gonna be windy all day today so whatever so this is number three down the hatch once they're good in the beginning and the aftertaste comes they're like super gummy like they definitely don't like just disappear like you do have to chew them down i feel like some gummies they just kind of like gone so they're more of like a chewy gummy i like them i don't hate them so i guess i've already had all of them no yeah cause there's six four five six so this is number four because i was like wait i what but no i have one more to eat after this one so there's six left in here i've already done 40 milligrams and this is my last one i'm so happy i love to get to the last edible if i don't really enjoy it i feel like it wasn't that bad i would definitely rate these for the price point and everything um i got them for like i think 15 and then i got them like on like a special promotion deal on edibles so it was like 13 but with tax it was still like 15 16 so for the price the regular price i think for them is like 20. so for the price um would i get them again probably not i would probably get the other ones that i enjoy more but they're not bad they're definitely not like horrible or anything i just feel like that aftertaste is kind of strong it was really strong with the pink lemonade ones for sure but with these ones it wasn't as bad so i feel like i just gotta try maybe different flavors and i will enjoy it a little bit more so i don't hate the guys i really don't but i definitely feel like there's better out there but they're not horrible they're definitely i would give them like a nine no seven to eight eight and a half kind of thing so i was", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they

do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage

well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "VWrYRMJQJVA": "[Music] is it true buds TV edibles review we're looking at the Chiba choo 100 milligram caramel hybrid it looks delicious I got a discount on this one I think I got it for like 10 they retail for around like 13 bucks which you know for the price that's a little steep I mean there are other ones I think the tootsie roll type the chocolate a fees are around the same price point if I'm not mistaken so let's open this baby up comes a little foil wrap let's see if it's broken into segments or knots okay just like the other ones a little widow can be a little tricky it's not broken up but that's all good so it's a hundred so what I'll do is get about half of that more almost three quarters Panama's case is down pretty strong actually has a nice caramel feel to it though but let's see if it actually really does a trick for the price point taste is good there are no other products are cool too but the price is a little high I'll come back to you in a little while and I'll hope I am just that so it's about an hour and a half later and it's pretty chill laid-back nothing too crazy no anxiety not two blades honestly I thought it was gonna be a little stronger but still decent I'm sorry to say Chiba Chu I will not be buying your caramel again I don't think it's the best bang for the buck but if you are a caramel enthusiast suggest trying it as you can see though I did an evil thing I probably line it up on the chart here I ate probably about 70 milligrams which you know but still cool and I'm not completely hating keep it choose a legit brand this is just the least favourite out of your products for me what if you like [Music]", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below and tell me what you thought about them again guys my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will see you guys next time you", "ks2Cc1fykuE": "[Music] that wasn't that good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show will be help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is one I am particularly excited to share with you guys it is one of the most popular brands out there for edibles and that is cushy punch and today we are taking a look at their brand new flavor and now compliant with the new edible regulations here in California we are taking a look at their Private Reserve that's right it is a hybrid blend so this goes up there with their other hybrid they're indicated sativa and now they have a private reserve it is about one to two dollars more expensive depending on affability dispensary you can pick it up from and I am not sure what makes it Private Reserve I don't know what that even means maybe it's the fact that it's made with full-spectrum cannabis oil whatever that means or maybe the fact that it's not a food product means it's what it's a the Private Reserve I don't think so but we're gonna eat it the whole thing just like normal so this is as they say it is sixteen by sixteen 6.25 milligram doses which is compliant with the regulations and you can see on the back it's got all the information you want to see it shows the dosage ml 10 pieces wait 60 minutes ingredients nutrition facts and on the side here we've got gluten free dairy free fat free peanut free and non-gmo I was really hoping there was gonna be some gluten in there I'm a big guy peanuts can take I'm sorry if you do have a peanut allergy though I must make your life really [ __ ] so here we go here is the package on the inside like the old cushy punch it is divided and like the four squares but then they say you should divide those four squares into four squares of six point two five milligrams each I'm gonna guess nobody ever does that now I just have to figure out how to get this little foil little off here I don't see an open here anywhere oh I think I got it I think I got it guys just delicate easy and there we go oh yeah it is it is very easy to pull out twenty-five different little individual slices no it's not it's just one big glob yeah I'm sure somebody's gonna take the time to take a little knife and cut this up into twenty-five little squares and not do what I'm about to do right now and just plop this whole thing in my mouth actually I'm gonna eat about half of it right now and then plop the other half in in about half an hour come on out no come on daddy's hungry [Music] my camera person just laughed at me I'm gonna get fired for that nothing this is a paying job god damn all right we have our gummy it is for squares they're mean you can really taste the Private Reserve that actually does have I equal considerably less weed flavor than in the normal cushy there is a wee taste especially in the aftertaste it's not as strong as the other cookie punches it has a bit somewhat present like kind of fruity punch taste to it oh it's not bad it does again it does have a strong cannabis aftertaste but far from the worst in terms of gummies it's not pleasant but it's small enough and easy enough to chew down POC down that I'm not looking not dreading having to eat the whole thing so I'm gonna eat this other little half in probably about half an hour and I will see you guys two hours after that to let you know how this cushy punch ride that reserve is Landon thanks for watching wheats guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] johner matey [Music] yo jerks welcome back two weeks it's been about four hours since I checked in with you talking cannabis in ears cushy punch Private Reserve and it's only been four hours four not any particular reason largely just because I am lazy but I am happy to tell you that the cushy punch Private Reserve is at least as good as the normal cushy punch I'm not sure we declare it any better it seems to taste about the same maybe slightly better and I'm about as high as I am a hundred milligram cushy punch which is pretty good and high for a hundred milligram edible so I'm altum Utley quite pleased with this I picked it up for a cheaper price I believe only $12 which is a very cheap price I assume you're gonna have to pay if you're paying full price plus tax on this closer to 28 places and for that price I mean it's right in line with the other gummies it's probably worth it I'm not sure it's worth a premium over the normal cushy punch but if you're feeling fancy and you want to donate an extra dollar to the fine folks at cushy punch go for it I think I'll just stick with the regular ones from now on and that guys is gonna do it for this review thumbs up for me but before I go I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that can be enjoyed with or without weed something you could just watch and enjoy throughout your week and this one guys I do definitely definitely recommend that you have weed because you're probably not going to make it through without it and that is my favorite music video of all time and that is Corey Shores crying for America it's a bit hard to find I'm not gonna lie it's not easy son but I will be sure to include a link in the description so that you guys can check out this music video and feel inspired and maybe for the first time in three or four years believe in America I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it Wow again um this review is cushy punch Private Reserve it's pretty good but my cherry on top is [Music] I'm praying [Music] Cory you know what's gonna have trouble with this it's Cory shores crying for America and Wow Wow thanks for watching weeds guys we'll see on the next review", "pRUcYVvUkBY": "hello stoners and stoners welcome back to stone alone today we're going to be talking about some [ __ ] today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh you know maybe hit that subscribe button if you will stay tuned for the movie", "ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "pv82IEKMyxk": "guys Laver here I got a hundred milligram Medi bear bye I don't know who but Cheers hmm 100 milligrams of THC tune-up real [ __ ] good Sam are you chewing up the bagging case to be a Joe in it we pitch our winterized he definitely did some beer chilling it now oh yeah", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie

"[Music] hi friends welcome awaits the marijuana review show we help you determine which products are worth your money and which ones should be left on the trash pile of history we're not necessarily history I don't think any of these products are gonna make history but if there is one product out there that is guaranteed to make history it's the one that I've got in my hand we're going to be doing another edible review today and my heart of hearts my favorite of favorites Kanak oh that's right guys we're back with another Kanaka review we are reviewing their chocolate chip cookie today and I'm really delighted to see that these have are already compliant with the new regulations they've got this little sticker on here saying ten the ten milligrams scored pieces per package so that means they're good to go with the regs theoretically so that hopefully that means they'll be in more areas soon hopefully that means that you guys can find can't go play in your dispensaries and start enjoying the products as well now um if you've never seen a can't go review before I heart them I love them they're my favorite edible manufacturer in the world I've got no doubt some thinking this one's gonna be great this one here is a hundred milligram variety as you can see from the sticker on the top lovely packaging as always from Kanak oh nice box nutrition information on the back just great great stuff to see love it as always so let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste here it is in their traditional sort of teal greeny packaging for their 100 milligram varieties and I'm interested to see how its scored to be ten different ten milligram pieces of course this is wheat so we're eating the whole thing not just a single piece oh wow yeah this is uh this is their idea of look it's ten different it's ten different pieces because it has ten different little cut marks on it fine by me fine by me better than Corollas mini cookies which you have to eat so many of I'd rather just have one big cookie that's sort of haphazardly scored into ten different pieces scored let's go ahead and get a taste it smells great oh my god it smells so good let's give it taste here it's great oh my god no cannabis tastes really good cookie I'm most vibing eating this quickly I'm gonna enjoy I'm really truly a.m. Wow they're miracle workers I don't know what else to say I didn't know what else to say I do actually matters it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and if I have any guess it's gonna make me feel pretty good but you guys will have to wait a couple of hours well actually you guys just have to wait us a couple of seconds I have to wait a couple of hours to find out but through the magic and Wizardry of editing you guys will know in just a couple of seconds whether on highest buck or not thank you for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a few please deuces it has been Oh two and a half hours since I completed that wonderful wonderful can of coke and guys it lives up to Kanako's reputation I was gonna tell you about where I am and what I'm doing what I just saw oh I just saw I Tania and woo I'm not sure what to say about that but here's why I am sure I want to say Jericho's chocolate-chip cookie while it's ridiculous they're split into 10 pieces strategy is the little preposterous it's still as amazing as it ever was and hopefully always will be because even at 100 milligrams I'm I'm like a seven five maybe and it tasted delicious couldn't recommend it more highly and I picked it up my dispensary at a discount I believe for an average of nine bucks I say average because I got two for a discount see that's how good Kanaka is is I'm trying to explain my math of purchasing to you all you need to know is buy it if you see it you're really gonna like it just don't split it into tenths just eat the whole thing you'll be happy ok thank you so much for watching guys you're wonderful and and thanks thanks so much deuces", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next

so because they've created both a strange\nand unapproved solution to ED. True, there are Kamagra pills, but that feels\nso formal when you could be slurping down Kamagra Oral Jelly, available in an assortment of flavors like strawberry, kiwi, and ...\nbutterscotch. But don't go slathering that jelly on\nyour toast just yet. Kamagra, which is manufactured in India, presumably uses\nthe same active pharmaceutical ingredient as Viagra \u2014 sildenafil citrate. For this reason, Kamagra is frequently marketed as generic Viagra,\nconfusing many consumers into thinking that, like Viagra, it has been approved\nfor use. In most countries, it has not. You may ask, \"If the active pharmaceutical\ningredient is the same, what's the difference if I pop the little blue pill\nor take butterscotch-flavored jelly shots?\" The FDA has not approved Kamagra in any form and in fact, in 2017, issued an import ban on Kamagra pills. Without\nregulatory vetting, Kamagra may not be the same quality as other FDA-approved\nversions of sildenafil. Furthermore, if a drug is not approved, that means it is\nentering through unofficial channels, which may increase the likelihood that\nit could be counterfeit or adulterated. If you're a payment provider or internet\nplatform, keep the artificial fruit flavors relegated to gummy worms and\ndon't onboard any merchant selling Kamagra.

asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other

classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after I finish off this whole bag see you then [Music] big Pete's welcome back to wheats guys it has been about two and a half hours since I first checked in with you and I am ready to check out because big Pete's is a big ol win and the potency column look at them eyeballs red as can be man I loved big Pete's guys the cookies tasted excellent this is on the top level of hundred milligram potencies I mean this is about as potent as it gets great packaging I mean look at this you know tons of information not and not terribly ostentatious do not feel like you're spending extra money on it big Pete's man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you guys without a cherry on top with something this exciting right that would feel rude I got it I got it I got it I'm gonna share with you guys a novel that I share with a lot of people that I quite like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that was a really long cherry on top and I just plucked that one out the sky love that book love big Pete's and their indica cannabis infused peanut butter mini cookies 65 million thumbs up way up in the sky but-but-but-but boom guys oh love you big Pete's I'm not a crook oh I don't know what's going on I'll see you guys on the next review", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "Ycpkm2BjNb8": "oh [ __ ] coding my name agile welcome to dab gaming TV I'm your host vory and in this video I have a very special edible for you guys personal favorite of mine I'm so glad we found a box of these hiding out my work because these things are [ __ ] fire you guys heard a keep Cola yet if you have it keep an eye out for these products look them up check them out I mean look at [ __ ] color come on this sells itself people are like what is that I want to I want to know more about that item all the time all day long so this to the best of my knowledge it's like some sort of like blue cotton candy blue berry something whatever I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] flavor it's supposed to be it's delicious it's really really good you guys a lot of cannabis drinks have a heavy flavor in the background this does not this is super enjoyable I've had their their Cola I've had the root beer I've had the orange cush they're all awesome this is the best one so I bought for today it's like that I just I had to swoop I'm not gonna miss out again and neither are you guys so let's get a little poor upshot here hopefully my camera's gonna focus fire guys be one sec let me check the camera here oh yeah we are in focus and let's go in for this poor now I know it's gonna throw up like a ditch but at the same time I just you know I wanted this shot look at that color that's a [ __ ] trip uh-huh it's just screaming blue right looks like something out of Fallout right let's get you a cola or some [ __ ] it's too cool so my favorite thing about this product is not how it tastes but how it hits it says on the bottle 100 milligrams of THC that's like did I I don't know according to whose standards but this [ __ ] hits like a 150 160 even like a 180 would you know if you guys have had a lot of edibles in the industry right now you know they vary greatly 100 milligrams in one brand is nothing and then 100 milligrams in another is really [ __ ] intense this is one of those heavy ones this is one of this ones it's gonna [ __ ] hit you I'm really really impressed so had one earlier off-camera starting to feel it now we're gonna go ahead and consume two more um um I'm getting set to have a great night yeah so let me finish this one with liquid because I think the cold ones gonna be harder to drink but it'll be more pleasant so trade offs Cheers yeah warmer you definitely taste the canvas isn't it but it's still good it's still really really good Cheers mmm that is the [ __ ] spot oh yeah so I wanted to make this one more of like an official review because of how I feel about this product you guys it's really just super nice it's price point and I don't really want to say well we sell it out if you want to check it out we're on weed maps you know check out some stats a dispensaries would keep colas and it's just one of those things where I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck a lot of canvas drinks are they're pretty expensive this is one of the more affordable ones I found and it just just works and normally doesn't work but it's really enjoyable to consume and that that for me is just a huge win because there's so many edibles out there that you just kind of have to get through or get through it and then it gives you bubbly guts you know like nasty just feeling like it's just too much so much [ __ ] you know it's just cheers to keep Cola you guys are doing it right much respect from dad even just shits fire seriously super fire so you guys can check out the bottle you can see it's a lot of information on it got this story there it says born in Colorado Keith's Cola and all of its products are intended to provide a breath of fresh air into the world of Medicine we infuse each of our products with premium California cannabis we hope you enjoy oh damn you know [ __ ] anybody from Keith Cola sees this small chance of that but you know if anybody sees this you guys as far as I'm concerned you guys have succeeded in what you set out to do this is truly a breath of fresh air to me it's so enjoyable I love selling it love having hot in the sales room just to show people especially people who dab because they have a higher tolerance and they're not that ain't a bull's a lot of times because they're a flavor person and then I can show them this and honestly say hey you're gonna really enjoy the [ __ ] out of it and it's gonna step very high up to a whole other level you know you're gonna feel like you just dab for the first time again or whatever you're not really even gonna smoke that much and they'll be like what I'm like no really for real come back and tell me what you think and they always come back and in life clock you got any more of this one or whatever it's just like it's just one of those things I love I love it it's so [ __ ] good you guys pop this second one shake it up because if you notice stuff does kind of tend to settle on the bottom I've seen that in like all candidates drinks I don't know what's up with that it's just something into the process and how they infuse it it tends to settle out huh but anyway I had to give these guys a rating out of 10 they're getting a solid nine like not to be [ __ ] with I haven't really had anything on their level and when it comes to a cannabis beverage in terms of like like this is this is dangerously good type [ __ ] like I should say that on the pond start slow dangerously good you know it's these are fire so [ __ ] it's something where if we have them in stock it's this gonna be like god dammit here take my money it's one of those situations for me where I like it I like it so much I like it a little too much dangerous Cheers yeah look at that [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna take a quick death because I just got home from work I'm ready to [ __ ] have a dad all right hopefully I can make this little duct work taking a rip out of that Otis today stuff so [ __ ] good there's just not a lot of edibles out there that I can truly truly enjoy yes you guys I understand you feel me let me know down below in the comments maybe there maybe there's something else I need to try tell me what's up my dad you know kind of awkward but is how we do it purity pure THC a dabs Cheers well that hits the spot after a long day alright so I'm gonna save this last one for my day off tomorrow not tomorrow next day for work tomorrow it's been a long week tomorrow is my Friday so at least there's that huh I look forward to having this one I'm gonna finish this one off camera you guys sigh don't rush it too much but [ __ ] this is this is so far I get if you see them anywhere do not hesitate pick this [ __ ] up it's gonna knock you on your ass and she's really just [ __ ] good my name is vory and I'm the dad demon thanks for watching peace [Music] you", "LGxMyTPPCDY": "[Music] hi guys welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at our second drink from the company that I just found out their actual name up I called them dozers in the past because there's the only labeling I saw was this little dozer guy right here I have no idea why it says dozers because the name of the drink is actually G drink by G pharma labs the same people who make the candy bars liquid gold the liquid gold candy bars same people make these make the drinks I didn't particularly like my dreams during class time but I've heard enough good things that I figured maybe I'd give you a second shot so this is a hundred milligram edible excuse me drinkable two servings hundred and ten calories per serving so 240 calories in this bottle it cost $12 as you can see there but I got it nine bucks so about what you would expect for a drink edible they're usually a little bit more expensive and edible but let's open it up here give it a taste and then I will come back to you guys after I drink it two hours is not good there's a very strong marijuana that astringent sort of acidic burning right at the top [Music] so I don't think it's as good as the Cannabis winter or be partly rape or excuse me the habit sparkling sodas but I'm gonna finish it and I will let you guys know how we're feeling in two hours because that's the most important part of the animal review so let's hope this it's us a little bit better than the G drink from last time and I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be two hours guys it has been two hours since I had the G drink pink lemonade hundred milligrams of THC and I apologize for the sort of construction going on behind me here doing a little bit of remodeling so I've got the closet covered down so I'm sorry that you guys can't see our fancy star system that's will be back there and I apologize that you're seeing all the mess that's back there as well but you know wall do one thing that I'm not happy to deal with is how unhide I am yeah this G drink is a total total bust just like the other G drink I had before I really don't feel anything at all and it tasted terrible so this is a this is a total bust for me again I can't say I feel high in the slightest and again and it was just the most awful taste going down the worst drink I think I've tasted so far and so yeah even though and it's it's not super cheap at $12 for the for the drink I think I'm gonna I would have to give a hard pass to the G drinks I do have one of their higher potency drinks to review think it's 210 milligrams so we'll see we'll give them another chance on that one to see if maybe they can turn things around but for right now I would tell you guys to avoid the G drinks if you're looking for a drink go with the cannabis quenchers like there's a lot and we'll definitely get you high these here so far the two I've reviewed major duds from me well guys that is going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on our next review peace", "kjWKarTcMuk": "[Music] well hello friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review ship again only because we are the only edible review show on YouTube so today we are taking a look at another product from TKO edibles we are taking a look at their s'mores krispies I've been reviewing a lot of krispies recently this one looks pretty good from the outside a lot of marshmallow a lot of chocolate a lot of crispy a lot of um so um this is I think the fourth or fifth thing we've reviewed from TK edibles this is my first hundred milligram er I've never quite liked the taste from any of them but I've always found them to be rather potent so I am hoping that this one tastes better it looks better than any of the others but we shall find out good and open her up and give it a taste here that is better tasting than any of the other TKO animals it's not great incredibly thick incredibly chewy well Arviat room it's not bad I actually kind of liked the taste of it very little we taste whatsoever I'm not bad at all thick and chewy if you can imagine it's like almost like graham cracker in there which I guess it makes sense for s'mores brownie or s'mores crispy and then the chocolate and marshmallow I like it quite a bit but guys as we always know it's known about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and for that I want to see you guys in two hours to let you know how this bad boys heading [Music] [Music] well guys it has been 2 hours welcome back two weeks has been two hours since I had the TK oh hundred milligram s'mores Krispy here and I got to say for a hundred milligram edible I feel pretty high I feel pretty pleased with it as in edible the best tasting TKO edible I've had so far and for 100 milligram ER as I said I am feeling rather high I mean not outrageously high by any stretch but higher than it was expecting - for a hundred milligram edible it doesn't feel that much different than their 160 milligrams to be honest so yeah I'm pretty positive on the s'mores crispy from TK oh maybe my new favorite product from their sin terms of taste and potency and they're pretty cheap - I think this cost me six bucks at my dispensary so this is a pretty worthwhile purchase I think so if you see the TKO s'mores crispy at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something that's not gonna get you send you to the moon something a little bit more low dose feel free to pick one up it's pretty good and with that guys I'm gonna sign off here thank you so much for watching this review here on wheats we will check you out on the next one peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "q4vWPMzOrNk": "[Music] hola mis amigos and welcome to meets the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review guys we are looking at a new brand something we've never looked at before a brand new product and that is the nut bar let's upside-down nut bar with this bizarre little like little emblem there looks like two upside-down sevens kind of so this is the 100 milligram nut bar cannabis infused a mocha crunch milk chocolate four squares that 25 milligrams each let's see on the back we've got our nutrition information all that good stuff URL boring ingredients and on the back they say at nug we cultivate and extract all our own cannabis to ensure only the finest quality is used in our product line should have read that better all of our products are tested for quality and potency by CW analytical laboratories in Oakland California always like to see that that's always a good thing to see that they are being tested by an independent body because you know some out there can be shady and not selling you exactly what is on the package as promised but these guys seem to be honest and on the up-and-up and I like the fact that all their weed is sourced in-house what do you think frog you like that they're weighted sourced in-house she's indifferent I don't know okay so I like the packaging on it it's got this fancy little pyramid shape or I guess more of a cigarette cigarette shaped thing with a little open here thing on this side so let's follow their advice and open it oh and then on the inside we've got highlights let's go ahead and read it because it's gonna you know it's gonna be overwrought and sort of eye rolling what to indulgences do people love more than chocolate and Phee cannabis oil was then folded into produce an infused chocolate bar with a flavor that will put you on your grind our nut milk chocolate bar is elevated to the next level with the addition of a balanced Bend blend of ground coffee beans the smoky essence of a dark roast paired with the crunchy texture only a slight rose can provide and a bi slight I mean light how do you take your coffee we prefer ours in an ugh mocha crunch bar okay fair enough that was pretty done we are the work hard play hard generation that's also I Rowley we've got our golden packaging here they like the fancy packaging which is good with me as long as they don't take away from the quality of the product okay so here we are here's our mocha crunch bar nug-nug and then those little seven looking things or however you want to pronounce those so uh guys I'm going to go ahead and eat this whole thing oh wow that definitely tastes like coffee good chocolate - quality chocolate if you're a fan of coffee flavored things you're probably gonna love this Wow I actually don't like the flavor of coffee as a beverage but I found that I really like coffee as a flavor um like mocha flavored things or you know espresso - flavored things and I don't I'm normally like a bitter super taster so it's weird all right well I'm gonna finish this off Pete the next couple of pieces and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling but for you it'll just be a couple of seconds and I'll be right back to let you know how we're feeling after this two-hour break thank you so much for watching weeks guys and I will see you in just a bit [Music] [Music] [Music]", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're

about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the

from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with

Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "Xzvry5RWQIo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up

further ado let's do this okay hi guys sorry I'm using a gimbal right now that's making this very difficult alright we are back with our Reese's treat Reese's treat here a hundred milligram bar cereal bar let's give it a taste first give it a smell smells exactly like Reese's treat cereal Reese's puffs of cereal mixed with the marshmallow fluff how does it taste like a Castelli version of what you're measuring um the Reese's puffs cereal is not a good medium for crispy treat they're too puffy did you dick they're too hard to chew so okay I mean I like rice krispies treats and I like recent puff cereal but it's just not the best of those combinations so I'm gonna finish this off here because it's gonna take me a while to this whole hung down and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling if it's anything like many of the other dedicated to medicated it's gonna be a little disappointing I've reviewed a couple of their products in the past and film them all little underwhelming but I'm hoping to be surprised with that guys thanks for watching I'll see you in two hours bye [Music] hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had the dedicated to medicated racy Street and this makes the triumvirate three four three dedicated medicated that are not so good this hundred milligram editable excuse me has no effect whatsoever don't feel anything or I don't think I feel anything total total bust but as they only cost four dollars it's hard to be super super disappointed but you'd hope even for four dollars that you'd feel something anything but that that makes the third dedicated to medicated in a row that has been more than disappointing so I'll review one or two more see if they get any better and if not that's gonna be that's gonna be it it's gonna be curtains with a dedicated to medicated line for me you'd think three strikes and you're out but I'm a little bit more persistent than that okay guys and with that that'll be it for this episode of wheats we will check you out on the next review thank you so much for watching see you next time hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "61i7200ZjZw": "[Music] what is up slices of home otherwise known as home slices I don't know what that means that's a weird phrase I think but welcome home slices to wheats the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary we help you cut through all the [ __ ] and garbage that is out there in the edible world and the packaged goods edible world we help you cut through all that [ __ ] and find the best products the ones that are worth your hard-earned money today we have a product reviewing another hundred milligram cannabis syrup blackberry flavoured this time and I would say so far cannabis has definitely proven to be worth your hard-earned dollars but we'll see how this one fares the BlackBerry flavor also I curiously I know I pledged not to do this again but I tried a different variation maybe the fruity color combination and the fact that I think I had too little sprite in too much syrup precluded me from enjoying the sprite mix before however this time I went with the sprite cherry even though I swore it off last time said it still was gross because it was I had only a lot less sprite and I had double the amount of syrup mixed in so this time I have half the syrup and I'm gonna have more sprite and maybe that'll make it more palatable we'll find out so I went ahead and took off this annoying little packaging here alright thought I did okay yes there goes uh let's pour the sprite in first or cherry sprite I know black berry cherry sounds like a weird concoction but uh you know might be good we'll give it a try alright cherry blackberry it this sounds like a coke freestyle machine right here sprite cherry blackberry soda all right I got my sprite in dumping the blackberry stuff in it looks very purple um looks like cough syrup I mean of course it does um nothing can be worse than the taste of that yeah I can be I can be comforted in the fact that I know nothing will be worse than the chocolate syrup I took straight and let me get something to mix this with actually I'll be right back who cares Yolo alright let's see how this sumbitch tastes this is cherry sprite mixed with blackberry cannabis 100 milligrams well that is significantly better still not good necessarily you can still taste it in the aftertaste thing this sort of heavy sort of cannabis in that thick syrup sort of taste but it is significantly better than the first time around yeah significantly better and the flavors match pretty well cherry blackberry who would have thunk alright guys well I will I'm gonna drink the rest of this over the next couple of minutes and then I will see you in two hours but you will just see me well I should I won't ever see you presumably you'll see me in just a couple of seconds but I will be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review alright guys I will see you then peace [Music] whoo-ahh guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis syrup a blackberry and I am pleasantly high maybe six and a half maybe a six somewhere in there my tolerance is still a little bit lowered but I I would I would definitely recommend it it's another winner from cannabis cost me eight bucks normally ten dollars again at a discount so it's pretty affordable you know right in line with a know normally costing one hundred milligram edibles and as you can see my slurred speech I am actually pretty high and I thought the sprite cherry sprite and Blackberry combination worked pretty well it definitely definitely helped that I had a better ratio of sprite to a better proportion of sprite to to syrup in the cup that certainly improved improved it I wasn't necessarily just the cherry flavor but yeah another easy recommendation for cannabis the blackberry flavor man you know it is what it is it's not not my favorite I think that would go too well actually no that's the blackberry with the cherry is the best way I've experienced it it was the best flavor so it is my favorite what was I talking about yeah I liked it that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching it as always and if you see cannabis at the dispensary nearest you and you're not afraid of a thick thick syrup you know something a little different go for it go for it thanks for watching weeds guys we'll check you out in the next review peace", "JmPIAQmsX6A": "[Music] a drink for the first time dozers we are looking at dozers cannabis infused strawberry lemon-aid comes up consumption advice on the back we're gonna ignore all of that comes with some nutrition facts as well but you're always handy to serving size 120 calories so there are 240 calories in this 16 fluid ounce bottle so this dozer has 100 milligrams of THC serve shake well serve ice-cold just came out of the fridge looking forward to it first time trying to drink on wheats so let's see both how it tastes and how it makes us feel and like with all our wheats mini-reviews what we do is we take the entire product down it and then I come back to you guys in two hours I'll let you know how we're feeling so not further ado let's open this bad boy up shake well again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you so much for watching guys and we'll catch you on the next video", "LMTzxpmUDlA": "hi everyone you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope you enjoy this video as much as if you know did I enjoy it though you know when you guys thought in the video under the honking time other brothers [Music]", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "4AIAdjvu4N4": "there's like not even a slight taste Wow hey youtube today we are reviewing spoken by loud pack and Smokies they're edibles that are sour blue raspberry and we have what's the other one we had our watermelon focus there we go look at that wow so pretty and you're so pretty - baby look it so we're gonna try one of each it's the other taste and then update few hours down the line see how it was let's try it watermelon window vegan and there where'd you find that oh yeah yeah they're both vegan they're both being and their dairy-free how do you open this Oh locate two green lines locate tab and pull towards the side of the bad boy how do you open that how do you open it so easily leave that how did yours look like this oh wow it's like really it's like a booty song we kind of look like those son kids like with warm Sun yes you know green reminds me of the peach a movie they say bud Wow Wow that's really good fire they taste like those found like the sour patch kids on occasion they do softener I have had Wow he stays really good touch smokey these are probably some of the best gummies I have so blue if it focuses I don't even know ready all right well this is kind of like mid video so the last video got cut off because of me being stupid and putting this too close and then it didn't or the camera being stupid cuz it didn't focus back in on our pretty faces so it's actually the cameras fault not my fault but anyway so we're just hi I decided to do it in like better lighting and redo it a little bit so you can see it all better see our faces better but this is the Smoky's blackberry I found out that loud pack it's only made with loud pack in California if it's an Oregon or like some other places made with some other distributor so depending where you live changes who makes it kind of so I don't know that makes me wonder if it's like different quality do you want to rip it open do you want to do the honors that's terrible yeah they're like make it okay purplish I know I like it never goes back again thank you how many we having - okay this time we're gonna update all three you're gonna have for for which is it's a little of 40 milligrams 40 milligrams and then we'll update we're about to watch Hellraiser and then clean our cars so we're gonna clean our cars and watch how rays and we'll update you through the process but uh cheers guys [Music] they're so nice just even as a regular candies I'd eat them like even if these how many day - right they do kind of look like morning regatta maybe I'm having 80 milligrams you sure 80 calories are you sure you way late to film yeah I'm sure eighty calories of glycerin of corn syrup of corn syrup and dextrose do you think that's really good tell me ladies cool see what happens now let's go watch Hellraiser are we gonna duck couldn't cursors oh yeah well it's still light out painter cars I've been probably update turning Hellraiser update so it's been about what an hour-ish maybe about two hours two hours yeah how's the edible feel I feel productive I know I felt pretty like lit but productive I feel like so we cleaned the car and we cleaned the car we clean the living room we clean the bathroom I clean the player with the girl we went to eat well yeah but that was earlier by like since we took the edible and now we're about smoke but yeah I feel like pretty productive not tired like though so we're gonna smoke and anyway yeah we're probably gonna update after we watch how we raise or something so far so good so beautiful baby [Music] long as it then three hours I'd say it's been pretty productive three hours I made some dink so meal it's oatmeal art and inside this peanut butter and doing stuff and it's like layered but the outside is that they just look like candy Cantonese - yeah they do the packaging gon point that tastes at some point like if you saw this on the counter you know these yeah take these oh we should take these to the movies 30 milligrams does the temper better [Music] what would you recommend this oh yeah for sure ten Blake a lot of scale to one detail [Music] recommending this like never or would you recommend this like everyone who smokes weed probably at night yeah because some people can't handle it but if you can't handle it alone these are definitely not or even this everybody yeah see you there go yeah we'll be fine I unpacked some packs of these because the flavors you got terminal anyway good job Smokies good job lab pack a plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest of our day so you should have a Zen rest of your day to do and comment your favorite [Music] I guess why not just comment your favorite out of it we'll just call me whatever you like the most and the craziest terrible story or at least impact [Music] a lot of crazy yeah Meitner probably be when I took the 5150 me curls apart and ended up on a doom starving [Music] that was little curly things and it does that it was one of those for $20 you're getting a really high-quality edible the flavor and everything is on point well we'll see you about the effects I guess what I'm excited yay we should take these in movies though definitely yeah let's do it or at least before is no if we do is doing movies by the time the movie ends will just be stupidly just eating the whole pack of it yeah", "8EqPg0dG4BQ": "yes with a lip your chin deed and its gala my

the cherry lemon yeah Tammy ferry landing and the bear alignment okay yeah that's right okay so we wanted to try the root beer today and we're gonna tell you how we feel as we are and usually when we've tried the other Dixie products the elixirs we've mixed it with wine and champagne champagne so didn't have any alcohol or like any anything to make it more dangerous yeah I've done it with water to it like they loose it just that gives it a little bit of like watery I normally just drink it straight out of the cap do you really yeah I've never done that straight out of the cap something that's gonna be my first time I drink it like a little bit right so there's six milligrams of THC per serving off a cap as a serving and there's seventeen servings in here so should we do a full cap uh yeah for us if you knew maybe start with one stop with one but typically I always think like starting with around ten milligrams I'm starting things and I like work your way up I know I always say roll the dice she can test you know just take a few things just to die and I think I'll do that one time we should like you know can G it's done it's done forever hey sister you know that no one's

beer we have three testing labs here in Nevada and every prize has to be tested out of one of them and this one was done by Silver State wellness and they do a lot of the things that we use they test

you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll

edibles a good life smoke shop rice krispies treats with some cereal they contain a hundred grams of CBD great treat and get medicated good life smoke shop bye", "gyRC7ek0Dlw": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheat sweets on vacation this is a wheats mini-review and we are coming to you from Denver Colorado today our first trip out of Southern California and we are gonna look at some of the edibles here available in Colorado but first a mini rant Colorado I'm afraid in comparison to Southern California you do not hold a candle when it comes to edibles so for example I've got the Dutch girl caramel waffles I believe those are a stroopwafel this is a hundred milligrams of THC and it cost me $23 so roughly if you go milligram two dollar ratio about 300-400 percent more expensive than what you get in Southern California but I don't want to judge too harshly this also is Dutch girl stroopwafels promises to have feel it faster with n.ex.t technology whatever the hell that means they say nano extraction technology and that you fill these edibles faster than traditional edibles now if you guys have seen weeks before you know we traditionally do 30 60 120 pip updates not gonna be the case on these sweets vacation review I'm just gonna eat these bad boys come back to you guys in about two hours and let you know if we're feeling anything at all so here we go without further ado here is the product open up here and it's a little waffle cookie a little stroopwafel if you ever seen these German type cookies this is what they look like mmm smells delicious smells like a caramelized little Stroup cookie stroopwafel cookie but let's give it a taste no problems on the taste phone I apologize in that regard Colorado but for $23 is this gonna get me [ __ ] up I'll let you know guys in two hours thanks so much for watching we'll catch you back on weeds welcome back to wheats wheats on vacation here I'm back talking about the Dutch girl caramel waffles the stroopwafel it's been just a little bit over two hours and I just wanted to come back and tell you guys how we're feeling so for one hundred milligram edible I'm feeling a little high not especially high but for for something it's 100 milligrams probably right about on target but for the price I am not familiar with the Colorado market as well as I am the California market but I'm gonna guess that's probably right in the wheelhouse of an average price but these things are delicious so wheats on vacation if you find yourself in Colorado looking for an edible and you've got some money to spend and you like the way things taste you like your caramel waffles don't be afraid to pick up the Dutch girl it's good it's just not gonna put you in the hospital which is also good because you don't want to be in the hospital either but it's also not gonna put you in your bed so with that being said thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you guys on the next review hello and thank you so

bloopers so Nelson just spilled the soda like over this friggin over the table", "kVI6X3fVnQY": "hey guys this is girl hermes welcome back to my channel says today we is getting lit if you are not 21 over please click off this video but today you guys i'm going to be eating some edibles so i decided to copy stoney gummies but i actually had these before but honestly just one like tab is it is enough to get you you know buzz or feel high but i'm gonna have more today okay i have it in watermelon i have it in papaya and i have it in cherry lime so these are all of the different flavors you know what i'm saying and this is how they look like so it comes with five gummies it comes with five gummies and it's extra strength 350 milligrams of thc so i'm guessing that the whole entire package is 350 milligrams my friend gave me one tab before and i just felt a little high i don't know i don't know you know what i'm saying but i'm only gonna have two today so i'm going to pick two two gummies that i want i'm gonna have two of those i'm also gonna have these nugs so these are medicated chocolate cookies and cream nugs you know what i'm saying so we'll see how these look like once i open them so i'm going to pick two of these i'm just going to pick two random ones and those are the two ones those are the two i'm going to try for you guys all right so i have these two in my hands so let's see what they are this is the cherry lime and this is the papaya i love you want to try the watermelon but it's cool it's cool so i'm gonna try the papaya first y'all my hardest raisin a little bit because every time every time i eat edibles y'all it literally don't work for me i either don't feel i either don't feel nothing either i stepped through it whatever the case may be i've never like had a full-blown high off of it edible but anyways this is the papaya it looks orange it's orange and like i said before these are little tabs i do not suggest consuming this whole entire thing y'all but 350 milligrams isn't a lot for me you know what i'm saying so it all depends on your tolerance we'll start off with start off with one and then move on so we rip one off this is the papaya one so let's try that it's currently 6 37 and yeah it usually takes an hour or so for edibles to kick in way longer than smoking you know i'm saying way longer time than actually hitting a joint so there we go and you just gotta suck that bad boy out you know what i'm saying so this is i don't know how many milligrams in here but not bad at all no wheat smell no we taste no saying very discreet if you're trying to be discreet so no issues with that now i have the cherry lime one i want to take that i'm so scared i'm looking getting scared i don't know if i should just have one of these and then one of the nugs all right how about this i'm gonna have two of these right and then in an hour at 7 30 i'm going to see how i feel i don't feel like you know super lit then i'll take the i'll take the nugs as well so i'm gonna take another cherry or should i just try the nugs right now right all right i'm just gonna try the nuts instead the the nuggets then but with the nugs you guys this is 450 milligrams you know what i'm saying 450. it's definitely higher than the sony gummies so i might not even need another stone yummy i might take notes for me don't i might take another stoney gummy depending on how i feel so these are just chocolate bars in here i thought it was going to be those nugs that are chocolate but it looks like weed you know what i'm saying that's what i thought those were going to be but i guess not but anyways these are some pretty it's like a pr it's like a cube it's like a chocolate cube and this is cookies and cream cookies and cream is my favorite if you did not know because in korean my favorite chocolate bar it's one of my favorite chocolate bars and yeah so let's give this a try don't smell like weed i don't think it's that good it has it tastes like cookies and cream but it has a like an aftertaste to it it tastes a little like it tastes a little spoiled you know what i'm saying i don't know so with the nugs you get six you get six chocolate um bars and these have and there's different flavors of these also so i got cookies and cream and yeah you guys it's kind of sexy it's currently 6 40 and i'm going to come back in an hour or so to other you guys so stay tuned you know i'm saying all right so i was pretty comfy in my bed as you guys can see but i don't care about the setup right now but anyways you guys it is one hour later you know what i'm saying where's my phone right there it is one hour later and it is 7 38 you know i was saying i took the idols around an hour ago and i honestly don't feel anything like i don't feel abuzz i don't feel slightly nothing so so with that being said i'm going to try the other one of the gummy sony gummies i'm going to try the cherry lime one now since i don't feel much at all i'm going to try the cherry lime one now and yeah the 75 milligrams per chocolate bar and with the gummies it's 70 milligrams per gummy so i've had i have one stony gummy i'm about to have another one so that's 140 plus the 75 that's 270 milligrams yeah i don't think that's much for me so i'm going to take another one i'm about to take another another tab this is not good cherry lime but anyways you guys it's 7 42 now i'm about to wait another hour and another hour i'll be right back if i still don't feel nothing i'm gonna have another chocolate bar so let's see y'all by the way i paid 20 a pop for these so i'm pretty sure i could find these cheaper online but i paid 20 a pop for these and for everything but are they worth it i don't know because i don't know because it's like i have to eat a lot for me to feel anything so watching some youtube videos about to go back to that i'll see you guys in a little bit okay honestly i feel a tad bit like i felt have a bit high you

we are taking a look at a brand that I have seen taking long beach in Southern California by storm and that is Miss Mary Jane's edibles and we are reviewing their cookies and cream cake pop both the first time we're reviewing a Miss Mary Jane's edibles and a cake pop period these are very popular Mary Jane's is very popular I've seen her everywhere her mug and smile and face I don't know how much more we'll be seeing her after all these new rules take effect but for now we'll review what products they've got and hopefully they get to survive the upcoming at apocalypse so handsome packaging here on the outside nice little cardboard box but well labeled well decorated nice packaging I like it quite a bit it shows what the product looks like it's got the ingredients and my favorite thing to see it shows the lab rating from SC labs 100 milligrams of THC and here SC labs you know you're always getting a quality product when you see from them I've never actually eaten the cake pop period before I know what cake pops are I assume that they're like cupcakes with a stick in them I've never had one edible non edible anything in between so I'm kind of excited about this and I'm excited to give this Miss Mary Jane's a try I hope its ubiquity means it is it is good but that SC Labs has already got me pretty pretty pretty hopeful so here we go packaged in there as well there's your little cake pop in an additional little wrapper and this wrapper looks like it's gonna be annoying to get off here let's see there's got to be an easier way to do this but I'm gonna make it difficult there we go finally got it okay oh [ __ ] I just broke the cake pop up a little bit it's a little delicate so here is the old cake pop let's just do it in one cuz it's about break oh wow wow nice delicious wow that's incredible I loved it the taste was incredible no cannabis taste whatsoever good moist cake I know some people hate that word I'm sorry good what's a synonym for moist good vaginal secretions cake that's [ __ ] up to say to this good cake good icing no cannabis taste love the taste of it now the most important part how it's gonna make me feel for that we're gonna have to wait two hours to see for sure and I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back to week guys and we are talking cake pops from Mary Jane edibles Miss Mary Jane's edibles this hundred milligram are here this multiple award winner I liked it I liked it quite a bit I love the taste of it really really enjoyed the taste that it was truly excellent and it got me pretty high not outrageously bad a you know somewhere in the average sort of 5 range mid mid still pretty high from it these and oh it's been longer than two hours which you should articulate it's actually been closer to four hours we got to dinner with some friends I got lost track of time but I'm still high four hours later from this but never got outrageously high at any point and as I would like to reiterate one more time I thought it tasted in credit no cannabis taste whatsoever and it's definitely a hundred milligram er in terms of potency so thanks SC labs for verifying that and again it's just a nice little package I think I neglected as well to mention the price I got these two for fifteen which is a pretty good deal 750 each for 100 milligram edible it's not bad especially for one that tastes as good as this one does so guys I think that's gonna do it for this review if you see Miss Mary Jane's cake pops or at least the cookies and cream one yeah maybe give it a shot I think he'll be happy that you did I'm gonna do another Miss Mary Jane's review in the future just to make sure everything is a-okay but asked right now that's going to be a pretty good endorsement from me so guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will see you on a future review peace", "CpV7wPw6edU": "it's going

me [ __ ] I'm in the club which battles here's stuff we'll have this a couple bottles off yet in the past walruses [Music]", "kZjm7U_RJkc": "hi guys welcome back today I have a fun snack planned for this video I'm going to be making some healthy gummy bears so if you want to see how I made this healthy and delicious treat just keep watching so the first thing you'll need for your healthy strawberry gummy bears are of course some strawberries after washing them I'm just going to take the strawberries and cut off that leafy top part and then begin by cutting each strawberry into smaller pieces it doesn't have to be perfect because we're going to put these strawberries in a blender anyway so just make sure that each piece is small enough for the blender to puree after you finish cutting up all your strawberries you're just going to place them in your blender I'm using a magic bullet it's all I've got so it'll do and then I'm going to put the lid on and start blending so this might take a while depending on your blender but you want to make it a really liquidy consistency so definitely make sure that those strawberries are pureed after blending it is time to measure out two cups of our strawberry puree and put it in a separate Bowl don't mind that my measuring cups are Wales I caught them in anthropology and I love them so yes just make sure that you have two cups worth of pureed strawberries now we are going to measure one third of a cup of lemon juice and add it to our pureed strawberries and then you're going to add a tablespoon of liquid stevia extract to the mixture as well and the very final thing that we add are about 10 to 15 drops of a natural food coloring just to really bring out that red color for our red strawberry gummy bears once we finished during the whole mixture together we are going to grab a straining bag this is a nut milk bag and then we're going to begin scooping our mixture into the bag to strain out all of the strawberry seeds you guys yeah okay this is gross this part is gross hmm looks like I just killed somebody okay now we bring our whole mixture over to the stovetop and pour it into a non-stick pan but you are not going to turn the heat on yet so you're just going to begin by sprinkling six tablespoons of unflavored gelatin on top of our strawberry pur\u00e9ed mixture and once that's all added you're going to start stirring it together it might get kind of chunky but I promise once you turn on the heat all of the chunks will disintegrate and it'll all mix perfectly together so you're going to turn the stovetop on to about a medium high heat and start stirring occasionally at first but then a little bit more rapidly once the mixture starts to heat up once you cannot stir out the bubbles and the boiling you are going to remove all of it from the heat and yeah that's it once our mixture has cooled down it is time to grab our gummy bear molds you can use any silicone molds they sell them all over the place but of course I had to get some gummy bear ones and then you start spooning the mixture into the cavities it's kind of messy at first but that part doesn't really matter just as long as each cavity is filled with some of the gelatin mixture we can go ahead and grab another silicone spatula to smooth away all that excess on the top so then each gummy bear will be perfect once they've cooled alrighty I'm back I let these sit on the counter room temperature for about an hour and then I put them in the fridge to harden I actually left them in there overnight and today is reveal day so I did take a couple out but let me pop one of these guys out of the silicone mold to show you it's so easy you just push on the mold they come right out and look at that look at my little gummy bear mm-hmm dude ants little guy are so cute and little taste-test let's do it mmm these are yummy and it's crazy that they're healthy anyway I'm super happy with how these turned out oops they're super yummy I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe I had a lot of fun making it it's actually really simple and yeah so thank you so much for making healthy gummy bears with me and I'll see you guys again in another video bye I'm fully determined to catch a gummy bear in my mouth straight up and down huh okay oh okay here we go room two let's do this thing no one was there oh well what the heck was that oh no he's on my shoulder I let him anyway ready one two three aw stupid toss to the top I got it mission accomplished", "Sts_DMj4IGU": "what of your db2 saucy back at it with another one today we're gonna be my bad I just woke up cold sick that up yeah today we gonna we're gonna be doing a review on Stoney Pat's edibles if you see it say I don't know if it's gonna focus but they say extra strength 300 milligrams 350 milligrams just starting packs Oh sour patch kids 350 milligrams usually just the packaging got these from the homie he said I can go ahead and have him up the plug when I had shot me these when I was picking me it looked just like a regular shower packs kits - the sour stuff you don't really look sour they kind of masked honestly they gross y'all gonna eat this you also have something to drink because you probably don't need it don't know if a so it tastes like dirt we are not even good we just won garbage it flavor like of three out of ten you come with a decent amount up in here still command like this meaningless just probably like 10 y'all about 10 of these left but it tastes super like tree it's not good after I finish these I'm gonna get back to y'all like an hour I'll let y'all know what it did if you did anything telling you right now they're nasty look I'm gonna go ahead and finish the recipes get back to y'all in like an hour let y'all know what it is if you did anything I have a high tolerance so sometimes edibles don't even do that honestly it's like 6:30 in the morning oh I'm talking low everybody's still sleep where these things are disgusting I'm gonna get back to you on the Alberto alright y'all so we back hour later and I feel nothing not high it was garbage wasting my time it tastes like we but no effects I don't know if my toddler and something cold but I feel nothing maybe my hair fell maybe my head feels heavy but I don't know that's just cuz I'm tired just looks early as [ __ ] in the morning so far so far these I know good the one that we're doing anything with them garbage Josh don't they still money if you got a hard taco don't waste your money bro please don't that's it negative reviews for me buddy negative reviews from me better just smoke some trizzie something I do don't fit around that something right now I'll see what time it is trade time on the road some get faded so yeah like I said edibles it's not the boom don't I am my review I got to get an F I'm not any higher than I was never buy those again please don't waste your money", "HBOaSjKZ8gA": "[Music] hello friends welcome weights the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and sorry for the view change here we're doing some rearranging here in weeks HQ and things should look back to normal again pretty soon so what are we talking about today guys we are talking about another edible and we are talking about our third product from the folks at Chiba choose this time we have picked up their strongest product they make to see if it's gonna do us the business or not so this is Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams it's about as good as you can get for Chiba choo and I'm kind of excited I never really I've tried to cheap and choose in the past both hundred milligrams found them a little wanting they were okay both of them they just weren't as good as other hundred milligrams and there they were kind of expensive for what they were however this 175 milligram cost me 20 bucks which is a little expensive but not too much more expensive than say a hundred eighty milligram chocalate bar or whatever but this is obviously less substantial than that from what I understand she Batu's is one of the more popular edibles I think they exist not only here in California but they're also in Colorado Washington there are hugely popular brand and they've been around for a very long time so they probably have a lot of brand recognition which is why they're probably so popular so as I said this is the 175 milligram version I like the back here it's got all the stuff you want to see it's actually got the lab testing batch it's got the nutrition information the ingredients all that fun stuff always happy to see it on any packaging that's available out there alright guys so let's go ahead and tear this open and see how this tastes if I remember correctly last Chiba 2 I had was a hundred milligram ER and it was not very good tasting so I'm a little afraid that this one might also be a bit delicious if I could even open it well guys that's something to keep an eye out for it is this packaging is it does have little tear slits but done they don't really work and that'll do it will just rip it to pieces okay so we have gotten our 175 milligrams chocolate taffy out and that is crazy to believe that's a hundred and seventy five milligrams of THC right there it smells terrible it smells like chocolate and bitterness oh here we go this is the hundred and seventy-five milligram Chiba choose deca dose extra-strength chocolate taffy Oh Oh God oh my god Oh oh good I wish I had some water on me Oh whoo well after Jason oh holy [ __ ] wow that is up there with the kirova salted-caramel blondie or the enjoy goldfish in terms of the worst-tasting animals I'm a rat that was disgusting I knew it was repulsive oh it was a tiny little package and it does have me optimistic though that that a tiny little package producing that much of it tongue twisting tongue turning vile taste result might actually be as potent as advertised so on taste you don't get much worse than Sheba choose extra-strength deca dose but we'll see about the potency and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours as I do with all our reviews or for you just wait a couple of seconds and we'll catch you right after the break thanks for sticking around see you soon the BAM we're back guys it's been two hours since I had Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams and it's definitely more potent than a normal Chiba chew but it's not quite as good as say a kiva bar or the Jose or a 4:20 bar I did not find it to be as good as that I am pleasantly hi ants in like a 6 but not where I hoped to do it been especially for how bad it tasted oh my god it is awful tasting guys it is who it is Dukey licious [Music] but it is a very small little thing and I always say I love small potent edibles and it's small and reasonably potent so that's a win in its category however I think this one costs roughly double what a normal Chiba chew costs and I'm not sure it's I feel twice as high as and almost you at you maybe it's hard to say I don't think it charts linearly you know I find what I'm saying highs higher high as in a linear relationship it's uh it's exponential maybe I don't know actually I don't know what the what the shape of the curve of a high is boy um this is not chiba choose that's making me talk like this this is exhaustion i have been up for i was looking at my watch which i dont even fun yeah I've been up for 25 hours right now so that's part of the reason I'm acting a little crazy but I am looking forward to this Chiba choose ability to hopefully let me get some a salamba because that is where I am headed to next to fairyland dreamland yeah if not fairyland dreamland boy oh boy if I had it and if I ever edited these that would this would be quite a job but I'm not going to so I'm sorry you guys alright guys but before I go and maybe cuz I'm just feeling tired and making you know being tired makes you feel a little pessimistic I want to share with you guys my cherry on top which is a terrible way of pitching that idea let me tell you something's gonna you feel awful no I want to share with you something might my cherry on top which is sort of how I should have started saying this something that I love to watch or do or read or see or whatever the case may be that is unrelated to weed that I want to share with you guys just a little something extra that I can tack on these reviews that hopefully you guys will enjoy and this review I want to share with you and this is why I said it's gonna be a downer this is why I said being tired might have influenced this but I saw in the bookshelf and I it's it's phenomenal it's it's another it's another game changer it's another one that will shift your thinking and thinking and that is the sixth extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert not Colbert but Cole Burke I think it is a book about mass extinctions and how there have been five mass extinctions throughout life's history on earth five times where what life was nearly wiped out and evidence suggests we are currently in the sixth one of those it's really good and and really well-written and and just a gripping read and it's short to like 250 pages so get on it guys I normally I'm not that forceful and I'm not that forceful about this one but if you if it sounds interesting oh my god I've been going on for four minutes and 15 seconds sorry but that does sound interesting yeah give it a shot I think you guys think you're gonna enjoy it it is pessimistic however I don't know if there's I can't remember if there's any optimism if there's any light in that book what am I talking about oh I am looking forward to some sleep hopefully provided brought to you by wherever the G Batu's wrapper is all right guys I am so sorry it took so long to spit all that [ __ ] out to anybody who's out there still listening thank you so much you're really kind for making the end of this one I not even I want to make it to the end of this one and I'm the one speaking have a wonderful day guys we'll check you out on the next review thanks so much for watching weeds we'll see peace", "3jGouD-hQ60": "[Music] friends love movies the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got with me bakery fresh goodness that's right guys we're taking a look at odd on clearance from rouse for a dollar forty nine double chocolate love [Music] that's right guys we are taking a look at straight from the Ralph's bakery about 24 hours old and I guess so actually about 48 hours old because it's already 24 hours old because that's why it was that the clearance section we're taking a look at the double chocolate loaf cake but that's not true at all we just got the duckling double chocolate loaf cake here because we are doing another gummy review it has been a while since we reviewed some gummies so I figured it's time to dip our toe back in gummy land and take a look at cushy edibles watermelon rings contains 320 milligrams I picked this up in my dispensary for 15 bucks so 8 L of a good deal which should be red flags sirens blaring what do we have here shitty packaging just stickers on a ziploc bag an exaggerated a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- Oh gummies obviously gummies are already outside of a few examples look at flourish look at occasionally cushy punch or tiki killers uh we've got exaggerated mode grammage and a cheap price so that all tells us that this might not be as good as advertised we're gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they're amazing but who knows when you see too good to be true pricing shitty packaging and gummies it's usually a recipe for failure but as I said we will give them the benefit of doubt and cross our fingers and hope that they are going to work so why do I have this double chocolate loaf cake well just to maximize my chances of getting high I like to take a little bit of fat before hand there's something to help process the THC in case it hasn't been properly managed so people bite of the double chocolate loaf I have a feeling it's gonna be the best tasting thing in this reveal this is dollar 49 at Ralph's on clearance it's still really good that's my dog nard hurting it real name's noop that corner okay I can upload a for now let's open up the packaging whoo these are stinky and ugly they're very green these watermelon rings look at how ugly that is it is just green all over if they're trying to win the contest for most edible looking most like looks like it has wheat in it they're doing a pretty damn good job but again it's not a contest about how it looks it's about how it makes you feel but before you have feel anything you got to try to taste it and I have a feeling I'm not gonna like the taste of these so here we go that's kind of weird it's like then what it doesn't that's kind of a neutral weedy taste but it's not terrible it's not as bad as at a pure infuse creations with their awful bitter gross after tasting this isn't that bad but the weedy tasting part is like the sugar on top it's quite odd each one of these claims to be a 20 dose 20 milligram edible really doubt that very curious again they're not great tasting but they're far from the worst tasting gummies have ever had I'm really intrigued by what is on top or whatever process they're using to get the cannabis infused it's really strange really strange you've never had an edible quite like this so guys well now I'm more curious than I was before when it comes to cushy edibles watermelon rings handcrafted in Los Angeles we're just gonna have to do the wait-and-see approach because I'm not sure so guys I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how it's going I'm gonna finish off this whole bag there's 320 milligrams we'll see and I will let you know exactly how we're doing thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace has been 2 hours since I had the cushy edibles of watermelon rings and ooh I don't it's definitely not 320 milligrams and we kind of knew that ahead of time and that's a huge strike against them exaggerating their potency but they're not totally devoid of potency I'm certainly a little high I'm kind of in the five ish range and I just don't know about the taste it wasn't disgusting but there was something very off-putting about having the sugar coating be the thing that has like the is cannabis infused it was it was very odd tasting wasn't disgusting but it was disconcerting in some way so I don't know I don't know how to articulate it exactly what does say lab tested on it again which is you know of course they're gonna say that oh it is infused coconut oil I'm seeing that now it must be the sugar that's infused I didn't I totally it's it's it's I'm confused by this one cuz she edibles because of this it does have some potency and it's affordable I got it for a pretty good price I just don't think it's as potent as they're saying and it's not gonna get you out rage ously hi I do have another cushy edibles to review and I am certainly going to review it so I would say hold off for now don't pick up any cushy edibles we'll see what the second one does if that review is favorable or you know negative whatever the case may be that's gonna be our final determination but for now if you see him at your dispensary and they are super cheap and you like gummy candy maybe give it a shot but I think I would tell people to hold off for now and the C for the second review if they're gonna you know prove to be good or bad hopefully we'll get a new termination in one way or the other alright guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I'm sorry I was a little bit wofully here I just I don't want to tell you to rush out and pick these up because again I don't think they're as I don't think there's 320 milligrams in there but they're not without their merits either and they just have a very odd taste sorry thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "5BXoeB5n-YE": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super super excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "obJwJv5JPzg": "[Music] what's up boner biters and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary decided to do a little bit of traveling today and buy travel I just mean about a mile away from my place here in beautiful Signal Hill California Long Beach right down there is looking a little hazy today so not quite the view what I was hoping but really I was here because I have a new camera that I want to play with so if the sound sounds terrible that's because it's just using the camera's native microphone and I suck and if the image is terrible it's because the sun's right there and I haven't looked at a few finder so we're just gonna do this one rock wild guys let me disturb hello guys and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I am sorry if I sound a little shitty I'm testing out a new camera that does not have an external mic so it's just the little microphone inside the camera today my apologies also I'm sorry if that sign sucks I don't have a viewfinder right now but what I do have for you guys is a really elaborate package one that I'm sure I'm gonna have trouble opening it is district edibles cannabis infused gummies indica raspberry hundred milligrams and as you can see this is some pretty crazy packaging and I was like these two little hooks here got a slide open I don't know we'll try to figure it out um I have had some luck with gummies recently like plus plus is great so my opinions on gummies are starting to change especially as like the shitty players leave the market like ed appears or infused creations I know they're still out there but they're not as present as they once were so now it seems there are a lot of legitimate gummy makers so I'm looking forward to this and guys I did do a little fad right before I took this bit or went on this video here so that way you are sure that I'm getting a hundred percent of this THC coming in so let's see if I can get this open here let's see it has some directions lift cap while pressing side tabs well it looks like one of the side tabs might be broken so well this is a bad scheme for for our guys at district edibles if they require such fancy packaging but their packaging is broken how are you supposed to get into the good stuff oh boy yes so this one is broken so you cannot get into it which means I'm probably gonna have to get some scissors for a crowbar because this is pretty solid plastic pretty shitty job there district edibles on your packaging I mean come on beer we all just want the weed yeah I've almost gotten it I'm just gonna break the damn thing tada we did it guys as a family as a team and here are our goodies that we are rewarded for all of our hard effort on the inside these 10 gummies right here in the back they say we are things like orbiter and gravity check and booster who knows weird little gummies they're kind of plush shaped and green as you can see and they've got just this little standard of lumen on packaging on the back of the top and guys like all of our edibles don't worry we'll be doing all 10 of these maybe not all 10 on cameras and won't bore you to death but I'm gonna let you know how they taste and then I'm gonna come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how they're actually because that's what we're so here we go taste test number one for the blue raspberry district animals and their shitty now broken ass packaging okay in terms of edible taste definitely has a cannabis taste still has that blue rat sour e blue raspberry taste not the worst edible I've ever had not the worst gummy I've ever had either but there is a strong cannabis taste to it which has me a little optimistic that it's going to be pretty poached but if you really hate cannabis tastes definitely want to give these ones a skip because they they have it for sure so here's a close-up shot of their little + or diamond dirt whatever you wanna call this cross shape do what second same as the first yep fairly strong cannabis taste but it goes away pretty quickly it's not that over overpowering style of cannabis taste either these are easy to get down they just pop right up just do them up and that guy is gonna do it for this first half I have seven more of these to get through which I will do in the next 15 minutes or so and then I will come back to you guys once we're all said and done in two hours but you know how we're actually feeling so thanks for watching wheat guys and I'll see you in just a bit deuces hey jerks welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two and a half actually I think closer are three hours since I last checked in with you and I am still talking district edibles blue raspberry indica and guys original intuition is correct in this new legal world of edibles in California gummies are pretty good now you can sort of safely by gummies that are securely vetted and lab tested all that good stuff I think a lot of the bad actors are gone um just because I don't think you can go buy a big bag of gummy worms at Costco anymore slather a couple of milligrams of oil on it and call it a product anymore that just doesn't work in this world for both good and bad so the district 9 or the district to start district 9 the district edibles is actually pretty good the taste wasn't too bad there was a decent cannabis taste to had not the cannabis haze was decent is just flatly pronounced but I am actually rather high I got up to I would say I almost even hit an eight for a second maybe that's because I was playing some Red Dead - and everything just felt a little bit more euphoric in that moment anyways but regardless I can tell you these are pretty potent I picked these up for 20 bucks in the dispensary in Long Beach which is about the going price of any easily and between this and plus it's pretty much a draw for me they're both now legal edible brands basically the same format each I think plus has five milligrams these have ten so these are about as strong as like the cushy punch hundred milligrams or the plus hundred milligrams so I don't have any problem recommending them I just think they're packaging sucks it's unfortunate that this one happened to be broken but you know it shouldn't break so that's one downside but other than that actually really really liked the district edibles I keep forgetting that name I keep forgetting that name so guys that is gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on a next review this is", "fLw9gFWrVAc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so you",

it's Nikki and I have another CBD oil video for you guys today CBD oil CBD products I have tried my first CBD product a few weeks ago over a month ago and I kind of got hooked a little bit a little bit not too much so I had recently ordered another trial of CBD so with all the CBD stuff I tried I tried the vape I tried the gummies I tried the honey and that's it that's the all the CBD stuff I try so out of all those I tried I really enjoyed and felt the most effect out of the gummies it gave me the best effect that I know so that's what I wanted to do I wanted to do a test this is an experiment I ordered two different types of CBD I was just gonna get the gummies but then I decided I saw this syringe oil that I wanted to track that it look so interesting so I went ahead and tried that so let me show you so this is from where's this from I think diamond CBD this is like one of my favorite CBD spots now to buy stuff because they have good promos and they have coupon codes and their stuff that actually works for me with like like it doesn't make me feel weird and it manages pain when I want to have it or I feel good so bubble wrap and box well I got relaxed gummies CBD a few sour bears a hundred mg and a daily boost CBD oil granddaddy purple a thousand 500 mg that's a lot let's just open the gummy seemed to come in these packaging for some reason always comes in this packaging so there it is it's a relaxed sour bears I love the sours I love the sours extreme strength extreme strength CBD a hundred mg's per pouch so 7.25 mg per gummy so this whole package is 100 mg s alright and alright it's it oh so they have take one two three gummies once or twice per day so you could take up to three gummies up to two times a day or as needed alright the amount of time it takes CBD to start working is up to 90 minutes so alright how long does the effect last up to eight hours and this is the other one this I thought was really interesting I wasn't going to get anything but the gummies for the test but look at this this is let me let this let me look at it daily daily high strength daily boost terpenes formulated that has a 500 mg granddaddy purp daily dose fully loaded with approximately 50 mgs of broad-spectrum CBD 18 plus this literally says 18 plus place up to 1 ml under tongue may cause drowsiness okay 1 ml up to 1 ml so this whole thing is 1 ml so you can place up to you can put this whole thing under your tongue Wow so here it is this is what it looks like it's a syringe it's literally a syringe it's awesome so here's a syringe and I thought like before I ordered it I was like wow you inject this and yourself the CBD but actually you don't you inject it under your tongue 1500 mg s 100 mg s it doesn't say how long this will taken it back to but like I said this takes 90 minutes I want to open the gummies up I'm gonna do a testy testy oh oh no unfortunately I'm gonna have to open this whole thing because I knew it it felt like it melted this didn't happen before I don't know if those my fault or their fault but it got squashed melted it melted it melted look at this I'm gonna eat it I'm gonna need half of it half of it should be like right there still taste go mmm maybe I should do um CBD ASMR hard to eat like this should I do this whole thing the recommended dose for chronic pain I like the face ID so I got time it I guess this is 20 mg for chronic leg pain uh-huh I'm to eat the whole thing I'm gonna be greedy I'm scared mmm I'm a candy person that's it's good very fruity I'm almost done I know it's not good to talk when you chew but okay I need to talk I don't want to stick here I'm chewing your face say anything so I'm gonna time it see I feel hmm mind you I ate breakfast it's like I had breakfast at like nine o'clock I ate some Farina like hot cereals that's it it's almost 12 o'clock it's 11 55 ohms so 11:55 a.m. I didn't eat lunch yet but I did eat breakfast so it's not on an empty stomach keep that in mind should I eat it in the morning but maybe next time I can do CVD of an empty stomach what is my syringe sour sour power I don't want to take the whole thing I'm torn I'm scared I don't want to take the whole thing this 15,000 M jeez I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna do the whole thing those teddy bears how was the how was it it said think I'm OD'ing this is seriously how 14 I just ate 14 gummies so that was only 100 mg okay sounds 100 mg so if I take this whole syringe that's gonna be how much was this one if I take that package Plus this is going to be 1600 M geez hold on let me look online and see if that's okay punch it 10 mg the CBD your body can only absorb before tea so I guess our body 1 absorbed that as much as what we're taking in syringe myself don't feel too scared there's no reviews no reviews I'm starting to feel something I'm starting to feel something and it's been 5 minutes so I think this thing's kicking in as soon as five minutes with a light breakfast a couple hours after a late breakfast I think I'm gonna do this but under my tongue okay oh oh oh this tastes like um frickin licorice oh I hate licorice mmm I don't like it I don't like it I don't have water Oh put the whole thing squirt [Music] this is disgusting look I did it oh I should've did that one first messed up my lipstick yeah now's disgusting I don't have water nothing nothing so like I said I feel like I felt the hmm I feel interesting I can't believe I did 1600 M jeez okay let's see let's come back in an hour I'll come back in an hour and update you on how I feel I think right now I'm going to do my fashion Nova on bagging unboxing so if you want to see me do fashion noma like right now I'm gonna in this video and I'm gonna do my unbagging of the fashion Nova that I bought if you want to see me do fashion Nova I'm bagging on CBD then I'll put a link down in the description boom I'm starting to feel it already I'm gonna go ahead and do my fashion Nova I'm bagging and if you want to check that out and see me unbag on 16 mgs of CBDs then be my guest I'll be right back in an hour and update you on how I feel in the meantime okay bye see you later whoo hi okay so guys it has been an hour and a half exactly an hour-and-a-half 90 minutes so I started taking the CBD gummies at 11:50 okay I started feeling it a hundred milligrams I started taking that I started feeling it now actually I took the gummies I took the gummies at 11:50 a.m. and the whole pack 100 milligrams and then I took the syringe the syringe thing a hundred thousand five hundred milligrams after that and then five minutes at 11:55 I started feeling something and then starting at 12 o'clock is when I did my fashion Nova I'm bagging video and it just was like I just felt like I was doing too much like I felt like I was just doing too much and I was just I wanted to talk more and be more lively like more like this like you know who I am right now I don't I think I'm just more like mellow and just like thinking like what the heck is going on I don't know I didn't even see the video yet but when I post it you know obviously you can check it out check it out if you want you don't want to that's fine but it was just like I felt like I needed to like lay down and just relax and stuff like that as for pain management I feel like it could do it's like could do pain management thing I you know I took like 1600 milligrams so I personally didn't have any pain really but I don't want to give myself pain so I don't want to give myself pain to just see if I could remove the pain so I just documented how I felt so is that it it could get taken to effects up to ninety minutes I guess it depends so for me it took an effect anywhere from five to ten minutes that's how fast it's such an effect for me with the light breakfast a couple hours before so it's like two hours before I had breakfast and then I took this and then I did feel something I hated I hated this syringe I really hated this this tastes disgusting I'm still have it in my mouth like the flavor it's like an earthy and earthy licorice I hate licorice I really hate it I'll never get that syringe again but um thousand oh but I do like the gummies even though it melted I really did enjoy it and that was it it's been an hour and a half and it said it should last for eight hours after this I guess I don't know I feel okay you know I'm still here I've been taking that much I'll you know like I thought I was taking too much I was scared if you see before but I'm better now so guys I survived 1,600 mgs of CBD edibles and I feel ok I feel good after an hour and a half I go back to normal I guess towards the hour mark I started to feel normal so let's say five minutes I started to feel something then 10 minutes hit me from 10 minutes to 30 minutes or so maybe 40 I was just like in like this height of the moment and then like after the hour mark I started winding down from feeling a certain way and then an hour and a half I'm back to where I was before and it's supposed to be still in effect so like I said if I had any pain I guess I could give me more like information but I don't so I guess if I have pain I pray I don't but if I ever do I will try this to see how it manages the pain that's it I don't know if this was any help to you but if you enjoyed the video then please like and subscribe to me

gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing

to the processed stuff that's out there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "JccjODeZjPU": "ladies and gentlemen Rose a gummy bears this gummy bears made from Rosie it's the coolest thing ever so we get some Rosie in I got in our and our measuring cup okay now you gonna have to heat this song because we need to melt gelatin into this so you eat it up all the alcohol it's not going to disappear you can start some alcoholic so we mix in our gelatin right add in some sugar sweep me a little bit okay stir stir stir stir stir stir stir add in some strawberry vodka okay beautiful now come behind it with a little bit of red food

family state MC state MC [Music]", "mgllweLNll4": "hey hey guys and welcome back welcome back to my channel I know it's been a minute but I'm back and this morning I'm coming to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work thank you guys for watching if you like if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel I'm sorry I've been away for a while but I will be more consistent with posting videos so I hope you guys have a great great day do great things for you and your loved ones and until next time see you guys later bye", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace

J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst

a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon bye girls", "xRmVXqKobMk": "[Music] Oh [Music] okay back and then cut it online right here [Music] hold it [Music] that's it okay [Music] yeah

[Music] oh my I'm good [Music]", "1tWIrhG9YGM": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make alcoholic gummy bears these are so simple so yummy let's go [Music] a small saucepan and put in a third of a cup of water one packet of jell-o or jelly crystals something like this then add 15 grams of unflavored gelatin and just let that sit for five minutes to glyco phi and absorb the water now the unflavored gelatin here that i use is this kind now for those that don't know what unflavored gelatin does that's what makes jello become gummy so if you just use jello it'll be very wobbly and fall apart you put the unflavored gelatin in it becomes gummy you get the texture of the gummy bear all right even now that this has glorified and absorbed the water turn the heat on to medium want to bring this to the boil and have this dissolve the crystals all right that looks ready now turn the heat off and we'll get to the next part and for however many colors you want just do this with each different color now get something else like a measuring cup that has a poorer on it and add about anywhere from a quarter to a third of a cup of vodka now add this to it now get your molds of little bears and just pour the mixture straight in just leave these here on the counter for about 15 minutes so they can set just slightly and then transfer them to the freezer where you leave them for 20 to 25 minutes if you want to only put them in the fridge leave them in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour and just take them straight out as you can see alcoholic gummy bears the gummy they wouldn't give to do that if they were only jello young and any other colors that you've chosen oh there you go now it's a party so you've got tons of alcoholic gummy bears look at them beautiful if you like these oh yeah this little dude yummy yummy [Music] oh so good he's drinking time I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "xbZluN0kMvU": "for this demonstration video i will be going over the zilla strawberry special cbd gummy bears so first off let's go ahead and look at the front of the packaging so right here you do see zilla's is a brand name strawberry special cbd gummy bears made with pure cbd lab tested to ensure purity and potency approximately 10 milligrams of cbd per gummy bear package contains 150 milligrams total cbd so that does mean there is 15 in here let's go ahead and turn it around so we can get a good view i really like the back of this packaging because you're able to see all of your gummy bears all at once and then also right here you can see the large grain sugar that each of these gummy bears is coated in and this strawberry special is a very bright red color looks really good and then each package is perforated right here on the edge so that you are able to rip open but also if you go up here you could pop it open and that's really nice too because it's a resealable bag and then there you go stays tight so that you can carry it around inside your boog bag purse or anything like that and nothing will fall out and keeps everything intact go ahead and take a look at those and there goes the gummies themselves okay let's go ahead and i'm gonna grab this first one here let me go ahead and close up the packaging and okay first thing you're going to notice guys this large grain sugar that's all over these gummy bears you can see it's all over my fingertips you can see giant grains on top of the gummy bear itself all over at the front the back the sides so it is very evenly covered in sugar it does flake a lot but that's to be expected but look how beautiful that gummy bear is guys look how big it is i feel like it's a lot bigger than a natural gummy bear like this is my index finger compared to it so it's about the size of the top part of your index finger and also they're very squishy it's not like a gummy bear you know where you squish them they're kind of hard and kind of you know you could tell that it's going to hurt to chew these are very squishy these look like they'll be easier to eat than traditional gummy bears all right let's go ahead and give it a bite okay so i went ahead and bit it so you could go ahead and see it's a very soft gelatin it is not like traditional gummy bears when you bite it and it's very chewy and hard this one is very soft and you can see that right there in the cross section after i bit it it is a very soft gelatin also firm to keep its shape but it is very soft it does have a very strong strawberry taste i absolutely love it i love strawberry that's why i chose this one to test out myself but it tastes very very good it does have a hint of that cbd oil flavor now that kind of flavor you can't escape overall the taste is very good really strong strawberry flavor it does have the cbd oil taste to it but that's going to be found in all the products because of course that's the ingredient that's inside of them so you will be tasting that cbd oil ingredient inside but honestly compared to other edibles that i've tried it really doesn't compare the strawberry and the large grain sugar does a very good job of blocking that cbd oil taste but there you go everybody that was the demonstration of the zilla's strawberry special cbd gummy bears and the 15 count y'all have a great day", "1PTvRxfVKKE": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty and there you have it some infuse gummies thank you guys for watching make sure you like subscribe to my channel bye", "UdlNSttS_tk":

So big thanks to Simple Health\nfor their continued support and for sponsoring this video. Now, today, I'm gonna be making a recipe from The Vulgar Chef and it is for ranch-flavored gummy bears. Ranch-flavored gummy bears. Let that sink in for a minute. Ranch, you know, that white saucy stuff that everyone loves to dip their crudites or\ntheir carrot sticks in. That stuff. I'm talking about that stuff. And I'm talking about gummy bears and making a savory\nversion of gummy bears. Sounds interesting, right? Because I've never had a savory version of a gummy bear ever, and I've always wanted to make gummy bears way, way, way, way, way back, back when homemade\ngummy bears was a thing, I think that's probably about\nsix or seven years ago, now. I remember when the King\nof Random made gummy Legos. And I said, yes. Step back a little bit. Actually, a few years ago, I did make homemade Sour Patch Kids, which is kind of like a gummy, but I've never used a gummy\nbear mold or anything. So, of course I had to get\nmy mitts on a gummy mold and I picked up this one right here. So I was thinking, I might need a little bit of insurance for this particular recipe. 'Cause what if these gummy\nsnacks don't taste good? I mean, I've made plenty of\nthings that don't taste good, but here's another ranch-themed snack that I've always wanted\nto make, but never did. So, we'll just put it all together. We'll make it a two-for-one video today. So, let me..... The rest -- other.... (tape rewinding) The other recipe I wanna\nmake comes out of this book. It's from the Backs.... \"Back of the Box Gourmet\". I've made other recipes from this, but these are all recipes\nthat are on the back of boxes of famous things, like mock apple pie, which I've made by the way, I will put the link down below. What other things? No-bake chocolate cheesecake, which was on the back of the Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips. Lipton onion burger sandwich on the back of the Lipton soup thingies. This is the Hidden Valley\nRanch oyster crackers. So while my gummy bears are setting up, I'm gonna make a batch of crackers too, because I think those are\ngonna be stinking delicious. So if these don't turn out,\nat least I'll have crackers. Okay, let's make the gummy snacks first. So the first thing we need\nto do is bloom our gelatin. Basically blooming means\nto rehydrate the gelatin. I'm using two packets of Knox\nunflavored plain gelatin. So we're just gonna take one\nthird of a cup of milk -- the Vulgar Chef uses a dry measuring cup, so that's what I'm gonna use -- two packets of gelatin; and sprinkle that right over the top. One, two. Kind of a cool thing happens\nwhen we have gelatin blooming. It kind of gets all\nwrinkly and shriveled up and it looks kind of, brain-like. Kind of like the surface of\nlike brain coral or something. It's kind of great. So this is gonna take about five minutes. So I'm gonna let it to do its thing and I'll be right back. So out of convenience, I'm using my little\nItaki Shabuki pot here. You could definitely use a sauce pan and do this right over\nthe stove, easy peasy. Or even in a microwave safe\ndish and just nuke this. Alrighty. So while we're waiting for the\ngelatin to bloom in the milk, why don't we prep our crackers? You're going to need\na bag oyster crackers. Now these are just like\nsaltines or a plain cracker seasoned with a bit of\nsalt and they're delicious. And, actually, I think, pretty\nessential to clam chowder. So you can find them\neverywhere here in New England, not surprisingly. So we're gonna need one\nbag of oyster crackers. The recipe calls for a 12 or 16 ounce bag. I have a nine ounce bag. So I'm gonna scale back the\nrecipe just a little bit. I have noticed just the other\nday we bought graham crackers for S'mores and my crackers\nwere significantly smaller. Have you noticed this? I'm not a huge graham cracker eater, but I noticed that when I\nsnapped the crackers in half, they didn't make squares,\nthey were rectangles. I remember taking graham crackers -- if you follow me on Instagram, you know I already talked about this in my story. I apologize for being redundant, but I really feel like\nthis needs to be shared. So the box looks the same\nin terms of packaging size, but when you open it, there is a gap between\nthe stack of crackers and the side walls of the box. So the crackers are significantly smaller. And my theory is that they\nkeep the prices the same, but you're getting fewer,\nless amount of cracker. I don't know. I've also noticed this on\nAnimal Crackers as well. They're smaller. I know that I've grown since I was, you know, five, when I was\neating animal crackers, but they're definitely\nsmaller than they used to be. Okay. So I think that's what's happening here with the oyster crackers. This book was written several years ago, back when oyster crackers\nwere in 12 or 16 ounce bags rather than nine ounce. Okay, enough of that. Dump 'em in. Two thirds of a cup of oil. Okay. Oil. We're gonna add one package of Hidden Valley Ranch\nseasoning, dump that in. Did you know the third\ningredient listed on Hidden Valley Ranch is monosodium\nglutamate known as MSG, which makes everything\ntaste more delicious? The more, you know. Deliciousness. That's why it's so\ndelicious, I'm telling you. MSG. I am not a huge consumer\nof ranch dressing, but when it's around, I like it. Quarter teaspoon, lemon pepper. Dill. Always reminds me of pickles. Dill. Half teaspoon of dill weed. I like how they call it dill weed. Boomp. Garlic powder. Boom, boom. Gonna mix-y mix-y that all up. Now, we're gonna pour\nall this deliciousness right on top of these. Oh boy. Get all of that in there. Now we're gonna toss to coat. This is like a bath. It's actually kind of\npooling at the bottom here. Okay, I'm going to have one straight up 'cause I can't handle this. Oh yeah. They're gonna be good. Yum yum, yeah. Hey, come back here. Okay. Get all of that in there. You will not escape. Now it says to bake these in a warm oven. Which I guess it's probably\nless than 200 degrees? 200 degrees? Guess whatever is the lowest\ntemperature on your oven. I'm gonna be using my\nhandy dandy toaster oven. Put them in a single layer. (crackers tapping) Spread that around. Now, place these in a warm\noven for 15 to 20 minutes. \u266a Do do, do do \u266a Our gelatin is pretty much all firmed up. There's still some dry gelatin on top. I'm gonna use this and\nkind of stir this up to get all that gelatin\nin contact with the water. I'm gonna close my window now because there's a neighbor vacuuming and it's kind of annoying. Can't go that way. Oh, I'm smellin' crackers. (whistles) Check on your crackers\n'cause they're gonna toast like lickety-splitness. Whenever you smell anything\ntoastin' it's probably toastin'. So, those look amazing. So I went ahead and\nturned off my toaster oven because it was getting\na little bit too frisky. Now we're going to make the gummy bears. Heat this up. Oop, see, it's already beginning to melt. And we want to heat this fully, so that all the gelatin melts entirely. It's happening quickly. Nice. Let me go in with my silicone scraper. Try to work out any lumpage here. Technical term, lumpage. Now we're going to add one\npacket of ranch dressing. Okay. That's looking a lot like ranch. Use some vegetable oil\nand give it a little bit of oil in here. My little gummy maker\ncame with this eyedropper. I'm gonna use that to\nsuck some of this up. Nice. Eyedropper of ranch gelatin. So we get some bears in there. Don't forget the lions. Let's get some monkeys too. Let's make some penguins too. Boo boo, boo boo boop. And let us not forget the gummy worm. So one batch of that\nmixture is enough to make one tray of gummies. I'm going to place this\nin the refrigerator. So let's snack on our\nwarm crackers, shall we? Look, those look beautiful. Hidden Valley Ranch oyster crackers. Itadakimasu! Pretty tasty. Mhmm. They could be a ranchy-er though. Honestly. The addition of the oil\nmakes them extra crispy. They're kind of light and airy and fluffy without tasting greasy or feeling greasy. So the recipe measurements include kind of a range of measurements. So I erred on the side\nof the lesser amounts because my bag of crackers was smaller. I would say if you make this, go full on and do the large amounts, even for the nine ounce bag of crackers. 'Cause I think these could\nuse even more seasoning. They're pretty good. In fact, I'm going to add some\nleftover ranchy powder and put that right on top. Now we have a more intense\nbuttermilk ranch flavor to them. (cracker crunching) Mm-hm. And it kind of coats your fingers, so you get that kind of\nCheeto, Dorito, experience 'cause you know, you\nget the powdery stuff. Yeah. That's what you do, people. Okay, delicious. How many have I eaten now? Like 20? Okay, girl needs to stop. It has been over an hour now since I put the gummies\nin the refrigerator and they should now be set. Let's go grab 'em. (Emmy vocalizes) Oh yes. Oh yes. Look at this. Silicone molds, man. I'm just gonna push them out. Boom. So easy and so satisfying\nand look at the detail. Oh, you gotta see this. Boom. Boom. Boom. And look how detailed. Oh my gosh. The monkeys are so cute. Boop. Yep, penguin's cute. Oh yeah, look at the gummy worm. (Emmy imitates spring boinging) Ranch-flavored homemade gummies. Itadakimasu! Mm. Wow. Those are strong. They have kind of a different\ntexture than gummies, though. They're bouncy. And I don't taste any\nof the gelatin, though. That's a bit of an aside, but, they are full of ranch flavor. They're actually very intensely\nflavored, pretty salty. Nice kind of buttermilk tang to them. The texture is a little bit different than a regular gummy bear too. They're not quite as soft. They're bouncy and chewy, but they don't have that\nkind of slightly tenderness and like, elasticity. I think that's what's really missing. There's not kind of a stretch. There's a bounce like\na rubber band bounce, but there's not this kind of nice little bouncy stretch to them. It's more just like ning, ning, ning, ning rather than that, heh. I've read in another recipe that sorbitol is what they put in regular\ngummy bears to give them that chewy softness. I think that's probably what these need. So final thoughts, are these good? They're fine. If you are a total ranch\nnut, you will love these, because they just taste\nlike ranch dressing. But they're in the shape\nof, of gummy animals. I think it's something\nabout that combination of gummy texture and that\nchallenge to your expectations of what gummies should be that makes this kind of\nan unpleasant experience. It's not disgusting. It's just terribly unexpected. Alrighty. So they have it. Ranch-flavored gummies and\nranch-flavored oyster crackers. Thanks so much for joining me.

(light bouncy music) Superhero power!", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to

let me tell you guys i'm gone [Music] what is up my dudes and welcome back to my channel so today we are back with our second delta 8 video i am nervous and excited so if you're new here welcome i do all types of content cbd vlogs not as much recently and now apparently we do delta stuff here too and she's returning what's up hey how you doing welcome back so today we are going to try moonwalker delta 8 and we have both gummies and a cart so we have the gummies and in the blue dream berry and then we have the cartridge and the sour lemon haze so today's video is not sponsored i finally remember to say that at the beginning of the video but i was sent these items to try out for you guys so the gummies come with 25 and they're 25 milligrams each and then it has all the information the ingredients and the calories on the back and it also has the qr code to see their website and then the cartridge is in sour lemon haze and i believe it is one gram and then it also has all of the information on the back and the um cartridge says it's 800 milligrams of delta 8 thc both of these are 100 legal most u.s states don't quote me on that and then their website is just moonwalker and then it's moon wlkr.com if you want to order them um so it just came in a normal package i always have to tell you guys that in case you're scared of like somebody else seeing your package and wondering what it is but it came in a normal brown box they came together wrapped with bubble wrap and then the only other thing in the package is the receipt it also comes with the notice to law enforcement and then like the information and everything so you're good to go with that um guys i'm being so serious because i'm so nervous you guys know i prefer cbd delta 8 is literally like a once in a while thing for me but i'm glad to try it for you all right so the gummies are originally 49.99 but they're on sale on their website right now for 39.99 and like i said there's 25 in here of 25 milligram gummies and then the cartridge it's also originally 49.99 but it's on sale right now for 39.99 um i'm getting information from their website so i'm not sure um if these will be on itself for long so if you want them go ahead and grab them so we're going to start with the cartridge because i'm just going to test it and try it out because i am going to be doing both of these at the same time this is obviously going to take longer to kick in but i just want to taste the flavor and everything for you guys because the other delta eights that i've tried um so yeah the other delta eights i've tried have all been different flavors and i've never had sour lemon haze before so when you take out the package so it comes in this little really cool container it's like hard plastic and then it has the twisty top at the top to open it and i'm struggling opening this who knows why all right there we go and then when i open it i smell lemon so that's exciting it really does smell lemony all right and then it just has the rubber stopper at the bottom we are going straight into this video um no wasting any time today while i do smoke i'm going to let you guys know i finally signed up and opened up my patreon right now i'm working on i'm working on transferring a lot of my content over there and downloading and re-uploading and things like that um i did my patreon it's literally one tier um and it's three dollars a month because i told you guys i'm not here trying to finesse anyone to make any money so literally it's just one membership here so you can like have access to all of my content and on there you can have like chat rooms and i can talk with you guys and i can put like exclusive content so those things are going to be there and then also all of my future giveaways will be on patreon um just because it's obviously going to be the people that go hard for me that's where i want to do all my giveaways from now on all right so we're turned on and we're gonna i'm just gonna do very very little of this like three seconds y'all wait so the first time i did the georgia hemp delta 8. it was so harsh and hard on me like my throat's tickling a little bit right now but it's not that bad this is super super smooth and this pen is like hella janky i need to buy a new one if you can see it's like literally tilted right here but this pen is janky so that might have something to do with that as well but this is super smooth and it doesn't taste bad this literally tastes lemony and i love lemon flavored stuff like i love lemon tea lemon cake all that stuff so this tastes really good i'm just going to do a little bit more for the sake of the video and we're going to put her away so a little bit about the cartridge itself i'm going to read off the website so you guys don't have to go look for this information everything is plant derived and the flavor is natural flavor it's not cut with any cut or diluted with any extra oils vg pg pe g vitamin e mct or any other cutting agent and then um the cart itself is made of quality grade stainless steel and such things like that so you don't have to worry about any crazy toxic metals but let's do one more that was very little i'm honestly very surprised because i'm a big baby okay that one was better i'm a big baby when it comes to thc it's not my favorite thing to do so um i'm just not a big fan of being high but also see there we go also the tip of the cart is like so my hands are so dry also this part of the car is so cool it's not like a typical how it usually looks when you draw it and also the oil is very very clear what you like to see with delta eight and honestly i'm gonna do this video like the rest of it vlog style just because i'm obviously not gonna be able to sit down and talk to you guys for much longer i'm a light weight when it comes to thc so i'm trying to get through this part as quick as possible and as you can see i'm just in my comfy clothes i got this huge hoodie from marshalls we love her i've been wearing it for like three days i've already washed it once and then i'm gonna try this i need my trusty tweezers again so this is also the flavors are plant derived and everything and looking at all the ingredients it's like stuff that would just be in regular candy plus the thc um hopefully they stay good and i am looking at it and it says we recommend starting with one gummy and waiting 45 minutes before taking more i was gonna do two but since i did the cart already i'm going to just take one start with one and then i'll come back in a little while and update you guys like i usually do because we love vlog style videos um and then it also says they recommend refrigerating your gummies after opening and not storing them in a human environment as they may mesh together it's pretty cold in my apartment so it should be okay um so i showed you the box but this is what the bottle looks like it literally it literally just looks like a gummy vitamin bottle it has the information on there and then it also has it also has nutrition facts on the back so it has all that information for you and this is what one gummy looks like it's just a beautiful cube covered in sugar i'm low-key high key nervous so it doesn't smell like anything it literally just smells like those um airhead straws that's what it smells like hopefully it doesn't taste bad it tastes like a gummy vitamin you cannot taste any like weed flavor at all or thc flavor at all this could be dangerous because it just tastes like candy okay we did a little bit of the cart i ate one gummy i will most likely come back and eat two or eat another one i'm sorry i'm talking like this my mouth is salivating so yeah i did all my chores this morning i did my work on the computer this morning i don't have like work work today so we're gucci it's friday i'm probably gonna order some food later when i get the munchies and let me show you guys the time because this is an all day video it's it's kind of bright but it's one all right to turn the brightness down but it's 135 right now yeah it's 1 35 right now i'm watching some youtube you know getting all my vlogmas out the way um i'm going to turn you guys off we're going to come back around 2 30. i'm gonna make my room super cozy probably close the window a little bit and just hang out be on my phone watch youtube and we'll come back we'll see if we need another gummy and let's see hi mckenzie once again but yes i will be back to see if this kicks in okay guys as you can see my room is a little darker a little more vibey now it is it is 2 19. it's a little blurry so it's been about an hour and let me tell you guys i'm gone um i don't think i'm gonna have to take the second gummy i am glued to my bed right now i feel like i'm laying on a i feel like i'm on a boat in the middle of the sea and i'm just melted to the bed i'm extremely hungry and i keep scrolling on ubereats like it's social media and i'm just okay yeah and i'm just i'm so hungry but i want to wait a little later to order food and i'm currently eating these multigrain i'm eating these multigrain crackers from trader joe's and i'm starving i want to bake some cookies but i don't want to get up so maybe that'll be later but i'm just checking in it's hour one we'll see how i see we'll see how i feel in the next hour to see if we need to take another gummy knot but for now i look bald but for now we're chilling watching vlogmases and i'll catch up in one more hour okay my dudes it's even okay my dudes it's even more later i have sunk in more into my bed and yeah so if you guys can see it's 3 24 you could see it for like a second and i spent another hour finally got hungry enough i ordered brisket off of ubereats from some restaurant around here i'll put it up on the screen if i remember and i'm just going to keep hanging out i'm not going to take another gummy um i have stuff to do tomorrow so i don't want to be gone for the rest of the night even though it's the middle of the day but i'm just like i can't speak that's me i i literally don't know what i'm talking about so i'll see you guys either in the outro or another update when i get my food so i can't wait i'm so angry okay my dude so this is what i got it's just fries brisket piece of bread and corn back there along with some banana pudding so yeah i'm gonna go eat and i'll come back and i'll throw you guys out [Music]", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "u1EzvbNJRRw": "hello everyone and welcome back to kayla's kitchen today we are doing kind of like a double review kind of thing the so today what we're doing we are going to be taking a look at the two new gummy tees that david's tea released with their halloween collection so the david's tea halloween collection in terms of like the teas that they were releasing is kind of like candy themed i guess um so they released two teas um one is cola crush and the other is strawberry gummy and they both came like in the tea one of the ingredients is like gummy candies so that's new um i don't know about you guys but i've never seen anything like that done before so it'll be interesting to try this out so i've never tried these before this is gonna be a first impression but we're gonna be looking at strawberry gummy and cola crush so we have these two little teas here i got two ounces of cola crush because it doesn't didn't come in the um halloween sampler the discovery pack which i also got and that's how i have strawberry gummy so cola crush let's take a look at the ingredients here so it has black tea apple sugar hibiscus cola gummies natural cola flavoring cinnamon orange peel and vanilla pieces and then strawberry gummy ingredients are on the back okay so it has candied pineapple hibiscus blossoms gummy bears apple candied papaya elderberries beetroot carrot natural strawberry flavoring and strawberries let's uh let's give these a little sniff all right so cola crush really does smell like cola which is really off-putting like i don't know yeah it smells like cola and it's so weird because it's cola doesn't necessarily here's what because cola doesn't necessarily have a strong smell right like it's something that you taste not necessarily smell so it's weird because it smells how cola tastes i don't know if that makes sense but that's the tea yeah it just smells like cola it's like really strong kind of artificial but also it has these big chunks and i'll show you in a second it has these big chunks of like orange peel right and yeah and and you can really smell the orange and the cinnamon the one thing about this tea is that it's supposed to come with cola gummies in it right but i only got one cola gummy in my bag my two ounce bag so that's a little bit disappointing um i'm not sure if it just got scooped that way or if other people's bags are like that where there wasn't actually a lot of cool gummies but i don't think that that's that big of a deal because i don't think that the cola gummy is really going to impart that much flavor so anyway let's take a look at strawberry gummy and strawberry is spelled like straw bear like gummy bear wreath yeah it's very fruity and very sweet but i don't think it necessarily smells like a strawberry i can definitely smell like the pineapple and papaya in here as well so it's not necessarily coming off as like super strawberry but more just like tropical fruity so in this tea the gummy bears are like they're they're almost like mini gummy bears like they're smaller than what you would normally buy from the grocery store but in cola crush the gummies were they were pretty big they're like an inch tall um so they're different sizes so that's going to mean that like you're more likely to get more gummies in this tea than in the cola crush just because when they're smaller pieces it's more likely to like be scooped in so i'm going to be trying both of these teas both hot and cold because or like iced but whatever the reason i'm doing that so when i hear of like a cola flavored tea i think that that should be iced um and when i hear of a strawberry tea i'm also thinking oh like an iced tea so we're gonna be having these hot and iced because both of these to me seem like something that i would prefer iced versus hot but first let's try cola crush hot so i have just a little bit of my little teacup steeped up here it smells very similar to the loose leaf tea but just a little bit less strong it does taste like cola which is weird the first thing that you get is like a a strong vibrant citrusy note and then you get some more like tart hibiscus mixed in with some cinnamon yeah all right so i have the iced tea right here this one actually really smells like cola hmm that's actually really good it's citrusy and tart it's almost one of those where knowing that it's cola flavored i'm like oh yeah it's cola flavored but if i didn't know i think i i would just think it was like a a citrusy and tart based tea it's very the orange is probably the flavor that i'm getting the most of and then you're also still getting that hibiscus and the cinnamon is more subtle as the iced version so you can definitely like it's there but you have to kind of look for it that's actually really good though i do like this a lot so moving on to strawberry gummy let's let's take a sniff it still has that really strong like tropical smell to it this is good as well once again i think that this is something that would do better iced i don't know if this is just like the serving that i got but i'm getting more like just in general like tropical fruits than it necessarily tasting like a strawberry it's it's hard to dissect the individual flavors because it's just sweet and like a tropical kind of fruit this is a good iced tea yeah i'm still getting a much more just like in general it just tastes tropical to me i don't know like i almost feel like i'm tasting coconut but i know there's no coconut in there so i don't know where that's coming from i think that the papaya is actually really strong in here because the papaya and the pineapple are so strong it has a very it's just it's much more like a mixed fruit versus being specifically strawberry the one thing that i do really like about it though is that it's not tart like it is tart but it's not super tart many times tease with hibiscus when they're supposed to be fruit flavored end up the hibiscus just overpowers everything because hibiscus is very strong and it just becomes this like overpoweringly tart beverage and i don't really like that so i like that this is the the sweetness from all of those fruits is really balancing out the tart hibiscus and i do really like that have you tried either of these teas if you have let me know what your thoughts of them are in the comments

three most common myths about cbd gummy bears who'd have thought it gummy bears and cbd ending up not only being used together in the same sentence but actually in the same product it seems that there is little left in the world that we should be surprised about but before we get too cozy about the combination of cbd and gummy bears which all sound very innocent and sweet pun intended there are three myths surrounding them that we feel ought to be blown apart first of all cbd gummy bears do not contain the same amounts of cannabinoid some gummy bears have five milligrams of cbd in them while others have 15 milligrams now that's a huge difference in potential potency what is a good idea apart from reading the ingredient section on the bottle or packet very closely is to try and ascertain what strain of cannabis plant the cbd came from and if you can't do that at the very least try and find out how the cbd was extracted from it second cbd gummy bears do not offer fast relief contrary to what many say how do we know this well if you watched our video on cooking with cbd and the mistakes you can make there you'd understand why it only takes a few seconds to feel the effects when smoking cannabis because the cannabinoids in the cannabis enter the bloodstream almost instantly however when swallowed any form of cbd has to be ingested and then the cbd is absorbed into the bloodstream usually after a delay of approximately two hours now correct us if you think we're wrong but to us that isn't rapid thirdly and finally not all cbd gummies are safe to take the reason they are not safe isn't because of the cbd but more the case of where the cbd comes from now that cannabis can be legally grown and cbd oil can be used in certain products agriculture has begun to do what it knows best increase crops through heavy use of pesticides the problem is those pesticides tend to end up in the cbd oil that's then used to make gummy bears many pesticides are known to be carcinogens while others can have adverse effects on the body's organs if you want to take a gummy bear that is a bit safer then take one without any cbd in it though that isn't totally safe either as gummy bears are full of sugar and it is well known that too much sugar is bad for you the truth is virtually everything is bad for you if you take too much of it so use cbd gummy bears wisely and do your research and homework before you buy any we'd love to know if you've tried any we'd also love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure

doesn't really care for the flavoring of these CMOS nor the slime enos so I said how can I make this more tasty bingo gummies so today is Sunday we spend mommy and daughter day cooking and watching movies so I am doing my cooking part and I've already washed and soaked my CMOS I cut it up and I put it in their blender with a touch of water and I found these dried cherries in their sauce so I said mom perfect let's try that so here I am mixing now I want the consistency of hmm like a pancake because I did try this once before and I didn't post it because it was a total flop I don't know if I put too much liquid or not enough of the agar agar powder but here we go so we put a little bit more water in here just to get the blades going and as you can see it's thick maybe a little too thick I wasn't quite sure here so I let it blend so we can get most of that chopped up I had a couple of chunks but I'm gonna try it here at home with my ninja blender to see if I can get it a little smoother so you can see I'm pouring it in the pot it is thick and I said I don't know if that's gonna be too thick so here's my agar agar powder I put two teaspoons in the pot is not heated it's still cold so I'm mixing it in with the whisk and once I got it completely blended I had it some more water because we wanted a little looser than this because I got to remember that the CMOS will gel but the agar agar will gel it even more so I didn't want to take the risk of it being hard so I loosened it up some more and I do apologize I don't have measurements because this was my firt well my second try and I was just really playing around with this and praying that it came out right okay I don't know if you can tell that it's loose but not watery so into my gummy bear molds I left the squirt tube home so thank goodness they had a measuring cup I could use and so I had to use as you see an ice tray and into the fridge they went and within an hour this was the results and I'm so pleased with this I can't wait to do it again so if you try this and you come up with some more ideas please let me know please don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video peace", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much

much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]",

other drink of the day this is our Hennessy slush until the next time as we always say [Music] [Music]", "oOQlSEMnQs4": "hey Ron today I'm gonna show you guys recipe that I use from vegan gummy bears or any governor lolly as I guess these are great because they are really simple to thank and they avoid gelatin which is obviously ground-up animal hooves they avoid artificial colorings such are quite high quantities and a lot of volleys and they avoid excessive sugars and preservatives as well so they're really awesome thing to be able to do and you can personalize them I would recommend having a mould that has more than one more than one slot I only had an individual coming to be involved which was quite tedious but you can also just pull the mixture into a tray and louts it and then chop them up into little kind of cube lollies as well so I'm using a few different flavorings here which I'll show you guys the basic principle that I'm using is one cup of liquid to four tablespoons of agar agar powder so firstly I'm making a vanilla almond milk flavor and for that I'm using half a cup of almond milk two tablespoons of a baby powder one inch of vanilla pods beans and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia-sweetened and I'm just putting into a pot my half a cup of almond milk and then I'm adding into there my two tablespoons of a bag and just mixing it through thoroughly and I'm squeezing out my inch of Anila pods beans and putting them on the neck I'm adding in two tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten now mixing that up and putting it over low heat and allowing it to come to a seminar it will simmer for a couple of minutes and then it will start to thicken up nicely so once it's thickened up I'm taking my mold and I'm pouring a small amount in there and you can just put it in the freezer for 30 seconds or less and all sit really quickly and then you can pop out your first gummy beer or first tray of gummy bears hopefully and you can store them in the fridge next I'm going on to make the strawberry flavor that I'm using a quarter of a cup of strawberries a quarter of a cup of water two tablespoons of agar agar and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia like before sauce the same process I'm measuring up the berries with the water and you can strain them through some cloth and I'm just using a cheesecloth or a nut milk cloth to strain the berries through and then I'm adding my two tablespoons of agar agar powder and mixing them through and adding a small amount of maple syrup or a few drops of stevia just sweeten that and then I'm putting it on to low heat allowing it to bubble to and pouring it into my mold setting it and popping them out so next one that I'm doing for this as blueberries and I'm just using a quarter of a cup of blueberries and a quarter of a cup of water 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and some maple swimming pool stevia again and it's just the same process you could strain the berries or just puree them I'm actually leaving some of the pulp and this time it's quite nice like that and then pouring them into my molds once they've simmered with that guide a powder in here in allowing them to suit you so then I'm making a pineapple flavored one and this is using pineapple juice and it's quite an easy thing to do you could use it with any flavor adjustment also making some orange juice flavored ones as well I'm using half a cup of pineapple juice and add 2 tablespoons of agar agar you can also sweeten it a little bit further as well with some stevia if you wanted to and so I'm just mixing that together and then I am simmering it and pouring it into my molds and once I pop them out I had my little pineapple gummy bears and I also have these orange ones so then you've got some finished gummy bears those are flavors that I really like and they're so simple to do and you can continue playing around with all sorts of different flavors I haven't tried it yet but I'm thinking about doing you know like a coffee and almond milk once we milk and also trying different teas as well I thought my golden mango green tea would be really nice with the stevia in it and it would be really healthy as well so various things like that but just basically store them in the airtight container in the fridge for about a week they do sit perfectly fine at room temperature consistency wise but you know they don't have preservatives so you want to make sure that they're fine if you're going to do try this out I would love to your heart grows for you especially if you've got some awesome combinations and I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope people wonderful day guys", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "2zjR0bzWFhY": "let's pop what

you say anyway take a drink father that's annoying oh no but look this is my new taxi I've had it for like about a month but now I don't think I really told anybody upon here already tell anybody at all it was just like people seen that you know if you've seen it you've seen if you notice that you notice that you know that man they're not really awesome of a seven out of here and if you watched it this all like if you watched it and you know if you want it as long as you're true", "Nz3FOoMJAYw": "hey there today i am bringing you a product review and ketone test which has been highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "Z-Rf72ZWqjc": "[Music] I'm Jillian and today's episode is candy haul hacks that's right today I'm doing a haul video but I didn't actually go shopping I went trick-or-treating Milky Way's tootsie rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing my milky way to go cocoa for this you'll need a spoon a mug of milk for small milky way's and a microwave unwrap your milky way's and put them into the mug of milk now microwave for 30 seconds at a time [Music] strain each time until the milk is hot and the milky way's are melted still needs more there it's all melted and it smells really good this Milky Way cocoa is out of this world check out the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's not too sticky to handle you can take it out of the bowl and knead with your hand [Music] gummy and yummy and so fun funny and you can still eat it hmm hope you had a killer haul this Halloween with plenty of candy to spare for these candy haul hacks remember to subscribe to jumex

that's a tongue twister yup several different sour flavored gummies and they're all easter themed too so yeah we have warheads chewy bunnies which i'm not excited about there are three flavors of that we'll go over the flavors later yep then we have a sour than sweet sour patch kids bunnies and there are several different flavors of that we have trolleys sour bright gummy bunnies which there's several different flavors of that too yep and then we have green i can't do that why are you knocking i'm sorry i broke it so we got scooby-doo sour straws so and there's several different flavors in here too so yep assorted fruit flavors it's all says so the name the names of the flavors are on the little because they come individually wrapped so that each one has a flavor name on there yep so i kind of want to save these for laughs like scooby-doo okay so like whatever you say man [Laughter] so you want to do trolleys first uh yeah we're always disappointed by them because they don't have all the flavors yeah no so let's let's see what flavors they actually have in this one package yep and then if they don't have some of the flavors well then we're crap out of luck and so are you guys because all the easter stuff at our dollar store now is pretty much gone so we would have to order these on amazon to be able to test out the rest and even then it's still a guess on whether or not we're actually going to get the flavors because you know they don't count how many they actually put in so the flavors we have for the trolley sour bite gummy bunnies is we have lemon strawberry cherry lime orange and for some reason the blue is grape doesn't make any sense they could have still made it purple but i guess they're trying to get bright colors and the calories for these uh nine the serving size is nine pieces and it's 100 calories per serving it's 270 per container yes so no was this little is this an activity says color in the bunny's ears and glasses coloring in i guess rainbow i guess oh yeah yeah did you see that it's a blank rabbit there and i guess they want you to color it in rainbow like that that's that's weird i've never seen that before so i'm gonna see what flavors they have in here real quick see they have lemon i believe they have strawberry because the strawberry and cherry kind of look the same but one slightly lighter than the other yeah yeah they have lime they have two orange so that's good and they have grapes which could have just been blue raspberry sour raspberry so they have all the flavors at least yes at least they have all the flavors so the first ones that we're going to try is the lemon ones because i'm pretty sure the lemon the cherry and the lime are going to be the most sour ones yep so uh i really got a paper cut just now on that cardboard cute yeah let me just open this real quick yep i'm good oh wow the fruity aroma is crazy with that yeah it definitely smells like processed sugar and fruit that's for sure so when i say lemon so we're going to order the flavors that is listed so the first one is lemon so we're going to try that real quick and they're cute this one looks like it had his face punched in like someone ripped out the nose and took the bone with it like all right so we'll try that in three two one not too sour no that's actually enjoyable you you have a slight little pucker but it's not you know anything like it's not crazy yeah so let me see if i could differentiate the strawberry from the cherry here it looks like i'm able to yeah okay all right so now we have two strawberry these ones have the nose fully there for some reason i'm getting random sour yeah random about the sour on like random parts of my tongue and it's making me twitch every single time i have one in the back like towards the back of my throat i have one up on the top of my jaw i have one on the left back side of my tongue and on the right front side of my tongue wow everywhere all right anyway so we got strawberry here yep i like strawberry all right there's a good flavor uh profile yeah it's not sour no that one wasn't sour at all now this is cherry which i assume is gonna be sour just because it's cherry cherries bitter so bitter and sour or pretty similar in terms of reaction so for some reason yeah yeah it's actually really light well has a bit of a sour cake afterwards but all right so now we got lime i didn't think that one was too bad no none of them are really sour no no these i actually don't mind so we got lime which could have just been green apple come on now yep that kind of tastes like the way incense smells that was weird yeah and it does pack a little bit of a sour punch a little bit now i didn't get much on mine but i tasted more out of that one than the others oh okay this one we have exactly two orange so that's good yup so we'll try that and see how this one actually has a face on it the face isn't punched in or or randomly rounded i can see the eyes and the nose and the little cheek things anyway oh that one's a little sour mm-hmm orange gummies are always going to be my favorite no matter what i say that so much but yep it's a fact my guy my grape yeah and now this this this is grape everybody grape hmm you know it's kind of kind of messes with your head a little bit it's a nice flavored grape it is a nice flavor grape but it messes with your head because normally you would see grape as purple and you know from eating a purple item that is grape no matter what like it is always grape unless you have like some exotic thing like like eggplant or something like that it's always great but then you make look at that blue yeah it's like you look at it and you're thinking it's gonna be raspberry yeah but you get grape it kind of messes with your brain a little bit yeah it did mess with mine too yeah yeah all right so the next one we're gonna try is sour patch the sour patch kids and we're gonna see how they'll see if there's a few flavors in this one too i don't think they yeah they don't list all this one well let's go by what the colors are supposedly and we'll try to figure out the flavors and the serving size is 12 pieces and it's 110 calories for 12 pieces yup or if you eat the whole box it's 320. yep so here we go and guys if i seem a little bit off from tasting these candies because i ate crabs on the m ms before doing any of these and i shouldn't add that with chocolate before doing this because it's kind of messing with me a little bit this is the red ones yeah they're little bunnies well see here's the thing if you remember what actual sour patch kids look like this is the bunny setting straight up but if you remember what a sour patch kit actually looks like it looks like that did you turn it upside down yes that's what i'm saying it looks like an actual sour patch kid that kind of messed with me a little bit i was like wait i thought they were supposed to be bunnies when i was handed it i was like but literally like from quick view it just looks like a regular sour patch kid but it's literally a rabbit upside down that's crazy because you see the guys yeah yeah exactly yeah that's more all right so this one i'm going to assume is strawberry or something like that strawberry or a cherry it's pink it's reddish pink yeah reddish pink let's do that again all right so these ones i know are going to be sour because these are always really potent i was just about all right let's go and now it's gone i'm not sure doesn't make me salivate like crazy i think that was strawberry orange orange once again my mind was messed up from the positioning oh that one was really sour oh i don't have more showed up neither do i well by the way if if you realize that we're wearing the same alphas we're trying to pile a bunch of videos into one day so we can get more done and have time to actually upload them instead of doing a video a day like we were right and then rushing to do it not making good content yeah i'm assuming green apple yeah i'm going to some green apple too i'm you ready to die mhm nice lime i don't like that flavor ah i think last one yellow which is lemon yeah i can't wait to get this over now we got warheads next i think it's gonna be even worse yeah yellow all right yellow bunny kid thing that one was horrible i need some water you want some water all right we'll be back in a sec guys okay we're back this is like this this the like one of the second times we've gone and gotten a drink in the middle of a video so i got my water so we can cleanse our pallets in between each sour candy i'm not even going to put a lid on that because i'm gonna be constantly picking it up so so this next one is the warheads chewy bunnies i'm not sure how many flavors they have for this one either it's basically like the sour patch so oh yeah good news guys too um we recently bought uh two plug-in chargers and two extra batteries so if it dies we don't have to wait about an hour to upload the video still oh only three flavors oh my god those things are huge they are what oh it felt like something was in there there's no yeah there is yeah it's green apple watermelon and blue raspberry so i already know the green apple and the blue raspberry are going to be really sour this watermelon might be sour too because it's a subtle flavor so they gotta enhance it smell smells nice sorry it does smell nice it smells it smells i smell the watermelon one above all of it so that means that one's going to be the strongest green yeah i guess green blue or pink green look at these these guys are real these things are really sticky too they're cute i like them these bunnies are really detailed i don't know if you guys can tell or not but there we go get a little bit of shadow on there so you guys can see it all right oh that was nothing warheads why you disappoint me i was expecting a big oh you know oh my gosh but they were so thick these are so thick that this you don't even taste the sourness these are some thick boys oh you you're just hit by a car all right all right now we're doing the blue raspberry i think that's what the next one was right yeah green apple blue raspberry yeah i don't know i'm looking at this for it but ready if you sit there and like suck on the outside you get i guess but i'm just getting some i'm used to that instant punch in the face yeah damn my mind mine was a test tube baby jesus look at it it got all kinds of messed up and then this one is what watermelon watermelon watermelon watermelon that one's got a really nice flavor that's a good watermelon well warheads the flavors are impressive but the sourness is disappointing for you to be known for shower candies i mean that's pretty that's that's kind of sad when sour patch kids out did you in sourness like you were the leading war you were like the leading sour candy and now sour patches got you by like a whole entire milestone this is only one thing though maybe they didn't want to like maybe crazy it you know i guess they should have though because it kind of ruins the brand a little bit well i don't know i like them though like i mean yeah they were good but if i'm not making that face then you shouldn't call yourself warheads you should be called soft heads or something anyway water yeah i mean i thought they were pretty good taste wise they had really nice like different you know different flavors yeah yeah it wasn't the same old same old no the flavor the flavors were pretty strong i'm just disappointed on how not sour they were and that's coming from a guy who hates sour did i read the i didn't read the calories i don't know so there are five pieces per serving three servings per per container and 110 calories per serving yes so and now before we forget it on these these are the scooby-doo ones that we're gonna be doing next and there are 30 calories per one pouch and i think there's only one gummy in each one i know oh it's a bunch of little gummies that's weird they're sour strawberries oh sour straws oh okay they're little sour bites yeah if you look if you look at the packaging you can see the little bites in there okay oh okay yeah so we'll try the blue raspberry they got blue raspberry i know they got where the flavors at where the flavors at i just seen them did you rip it off what did we just say earlier it's written on the package this is sour blue raspberry all right i like scooby-doo yeah i hope this doesn't destroy scooby-doo for me oh freaking the plastic was really staticky the smell is strong that's all that smells like bad raspberry though that's like kind of rancid smelling all right i'm only going to eat like two of these just because i don't i don't trust that they're really small they are they look like little ha ha fingers is easter right and they got the little rabbit pellets oh that's that's good oh they're hard and they're not even shower they're good they're like twizzlers a little bit like the texture twizzlers except a little bit harder than twizzlers they're not even sour they actually just taste sugar coated it tastes really good it's a light sugar it is i really like these yeah those aren't bad i have a weird boardwalk aftertaste but why are you dropping stuff [Music] okay so the next ones that we're going to try out are the sour strawberry so you guys let me show you these guys once again little tiny rabbit pellets so it looks like there's those looks like there's four flavors because i'm seeing we got oh watermelon i thought it was cherry so strawberry watermelon blue raspberry and green apple typical salad flavor just any sour candy really yeah scooby dooby doo these are the sour they're just strong and it takes a lot of power to eat them here we go good strawberry flavor at first still only slightly sweet huh i like these yeah they're not bad they're just like oops they're just like little bites like they're not even they're not sour whatsoever this is the kind of candy that you give the kids that you don't want to destroy with sourness i'm not saying they're gonna like it because a lot of kids like that really intense flavor but if i was skin i would love this yeah all right so now we got sour watermelon oh and we have a new sd card too so this one runs out of memory for us recording so much we could just plug in a new one yep ah come on these bags are really difficult they are i use my teeth man you want mine yeah i'll just take out of yours because it's being a pain i should have done that to begin with i mean honestly so sour watermelon yep not sour not sour fake watermelon taste very fake watermelon taste it's not bad but it's not good at the same time hot taste that one's perfumey after a little yeah that one's not my favorite yeah no all right um no on to the last one oh god that tastes like tastes like an avon product yeah yeah so now we got sour apple yeah sour green apple so let's try and open this ah i'm throwing it hey that one actually opened get off me how many do you normally eat you just get two okay yeah that's fine though all right so now we're trying the sour green apple oh that's an instant green apple taste right as soon as i put in my mouth i tasted it now is it going to stay that's the question no bad aftertaste no it's got a weird taste i don't really taste apple i mean i taste apple but after a while it kind of kind of turned into grape like a green grape after a little bit it tastes big it kind of tastes bad yeah it doesn't taste that great all right water stay hydrated folks yes all right so that wasn't too bad yeah yeah that wasn't too bad for the sour patch kids really knocked me out on my feet man yup and i was surprised with the warheads actually yeah so i love the flavor of those though yeah those were pretty good yeah i like how thick they were because i like thick gummies i like to be able to chew it instead of it being really tough like the ones we just tried were i don't like that i like gummies that are chewy something that you can actually sink your teeth into like a nice rare steak so all right so uh yeah if you guys uh like this video make sure you hit the like button so we know you liked it uh share this video out there share it to other channels that test food or whatever get our names out there and uh comment down below if you have tried any of these or if there's any other sour gummies that we didn't try that is at your local dollar tree that we didn't happen to get a hold of and uh once again um we'll see you in the next video and just be ready for one every day that's all i can really say have a good [Music] one", "EjbVn3G-Syo": "what was that the alarm system oh yeah that's the alarm is that going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this this shit's good this shit's good so definitely try it out man all right y'all have a good one hey man be sure to check out our two videos down at the bottom and uh if you like our [ __ ] and [ __ ] support us man uh like comment share subscribe do all that [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] bell you all have a good one born to cbd.com", "lfzVfqKCNUg": "welcome back everybody to gas station zebra today is another special episode because I went on another road trip and I stopped by a pretty cool gas station called Eddie's world and it was pretty cool inside was really big and there's restaurants and different shelves and stuff like that and tons of packaged candy there's lots of fun drinks and then obviously I couldn't get a real good shot but in the urinals in the men's bathroom you could play a video game with your pee so today what we got was white strawberry banana gummy bears they sounded so good out of everything that was there there's tons of weird stuff like this most everything there is sold in a packaged Eddy world bag like this they had some regular shelf candy too but it was all kind of boring normal things normal candy bars Snickers and stuff like that so I got these because they sounded really unique and interesting so let's crack these open and see how they are alright so here goes the first of all like the they smell super good and so here we go it's a pretty squishy gummy bear it looks a little bit squishier than like a Haribo gummy bear so let's see how it tastes so they actually taste pretty good like if you've ever had a strawberry banana shake with maybe like a little bit of citrus in there like peach or or something a little bit of lemon that's kind of what it tasted like a strawberry banana shake with like a little bit of citrus I really liked it the texture was good it was a softer gummy it wasn't something that you really had to chew hard to like get like into to bite into it they used beet sugar which I think adds to the different flavor so I think that's what makes these tastes pretty good oh yeah I really like them next time I stop by I kind of want to try and get some different gummi bears and and and see what they taste like the other flavors these just these just tasted really good to me I give these well you know I'm not a huge gummy bear person these tastes really good and I do recommend them but as far as something that I would buy all the time I probably wouldn't buy it all the time I give these guys like a six point five out of ten and but but they were good if you live by me and want some let me know I'll share some with you okay thanks guys have a good one bye [Music]", "515GSjc9Tvo": "let's make homemade gummy bears one three ounce packet of flavor jello one packet of unflavored gelatin and a quarter teaspoon citric acid stir to combine then add a quarter cup corn syrup and a third cup of water stir gently with a soup spoon then let this sit for five minutes microwave this on and off for about a minute and 15 seconds fill up your oiled gummy bear mold and let it rest for half an hour then place it in the fridge for half an hour push the gummy bears from their mold then let them sit upright for 48 hours and once your gummies have been well rested you'll end up with these perfect beautiful gummy bears i mean come on how cool are these eh i still like jelly beans better", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and I would love to talk to you guys and I promise I'll be I'll be fair and and equitable with you so I'd love to have you on email me wheats reviews at gmail.com or wheats at wheats reviews calm hit me up on Twitter Facebook whatever I'd love to talk to you guys again give you a chance to to you know have your own to have your sake because I think that's important too but my say is they're bad I think this is a bad product from a dis reputable company I'm sorry but I think it's true Cushie edibles mega pass

us we are celebrating and making a recipe for Mother's Day and it's special because this is gonna be the first Mother's Day that's not just for our mom anymore yeah this is Molly's first Mother's Day as a mom herself I got something so here I know why do you think of your sister and know your mama oh mama look at my mama over here you're an auntie this is this is so crazy I know I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like

gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can

epic DIY day we are mixing 10,000 gummy bear and instead of making a giant gummy bear I'm gonna make a giant wee bit it's not really like a bear bear he's a panda bear that you know looks quite delicious because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two kinds of bags in this pie of 160 grams and holds approximately 70 gummies accounted this multi bag holds 90 gummies and it's 200 grams we have sixty five bags of dish with brings up a total of ten thousand four hundred gummies are you gonna do that no I already ate it you ain't 400 oh no no no maybe like 200 300 small packs are pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do subscribe or I will do few lucky cooker you wanna try coming there anything is this friend no it's weird uh-huh you prefer the camera Oh No okay I'm out ah he's out too Haley's cats don't let go me oh

guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long

the gummy bears in three different flavors and I'm gonna show you how to make these hi everybody today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears make with these cute little gummy bear trays I got these off of ebay and I'll leave you the link below it comes with even this little dropper so you can put it in there easy we're gonna make three different flavors so the first one we're gonna make is blueberry wait 1/2 a cup of blueberry puree I just warm them up a little bit some frozen berries and then I blended them in my blender and it makes perfect PRA like this okay so we're gonna warm up in a saucepan the blueberry puree 1/2 cup and you add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice so I was just gonna blend this up and then we're gonna add the honey when you need 2 tablespoons of the honey like that we're just gonna melt this together really nice and then we're gonna add the gelatin right now I need to add the 3 tablespoons of gelatin and just kind of spread it around so it doesn't clump up in a spot okay just mix that up until it gets kind of glossy and all the Delta mix is off okay this one looks ready okay now we're gonna make an orange juice flavor orange one so we're gonna use a cup of orange juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of honey and stir that up and now we're going to add the gelatin again three tablespoons of gelatin and stir that up till it's dissolved and it's nicely coat it together and it should look a little bit glossy so just cook it up for a little bit okay that one's ready now we're gonna do the last flavor we have strawberry all right we put the strawberries puree in there half a cup of water a tablespoon of lemon juice and again two tablespoons of honey okay on three tablespoons of gelatin that's it stir it up really good let it cook up to dissolve all the way okay that's it now I let the three flavors cool down okay I've got my trays ready I put them on top of cookie sheets so they won't be so floppy because we're gonna put them in the freezer so I'll just go ahead and fill up your flavors here I'm going to start with the orange one and I did not strain the pulp out of my oranges so we'll still have that in the gummy bears so if you want to strain yours that's fine but I did not okay now we're gonna do this strawberry too much okay okay now we're gonna do the blueberry okay if you don't have a gummy bear molds you can use any kind of pan as long as you line it I got it's a wax paper and then I'll the wax paper you can pour it in there and then once they are cooled you can pop them out I'm just have so much left over I'm just gonna mix them together kind of make like a mixed berry now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all these in the freezer and they have to freeze for about 30 minutes now if you didn't have a mold and you did it like this just let it freeze first and you could chop them up into whatever shape you want or if you have the molds that's fine you just pop them in just like this and the cookie sheet or if you don't have those molds you could use any kind of silicon molds that you have I have these ones silicones and I have these ice cubes I only have the silicone on the bottom I can't really show you now has silicone on the bottom so that they'll pop out so any one of these methods will work if you want to just try it ahead of time you don't have the gummy bear molds this you can try it like this and these I got on eBay like I said they were eight dollars and I'll leave the link in the description down below if you want to check these out they're totally a good buy so I these I got 200 gummy bears for seven dollars so that's pretty good and I came with their droppers okay so now we're just gonna put them in the freezer like this for 30 minutes and this is how they turned out we got the Stars and the leaves in strawberry and the blueberry flavor and these are the gummi bears whole pile of them here they're really small cute perfect size little gummies and then these are the ones that we had on the tree cuz we didn't have any cut out and I just cut them into cubes shape I'm they're perfect - they're really nice you could try any one of the shapes or if you have something else go ahead and try it and our favorite flavor was these strawberry ones here so let's you try it and tell me which flavor you guys like and like subscribe", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "aeAwCMHrxP8": "[Music] what is up guys welcome to another video hey man for today's video man i have a bunch of gummies in here as you can see so we're gonna go ahead and try this thing out these gummies are special there are what you call edibles so basically this thing has a 50 milligrams of thc as you can see right there 50 milligrams of thc and uh so if you guys don't know what thc is so let me see thc or tetra hydrocannabinol is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the national institute on drug abuse so this gummies right here contains some kind of thc um so basically thc you will find out in a marijuana flower or a marijuana product so technically i live here in washington marijuana pot mary jane dahon whatever you call it it's legal out here as long as you have your state id and your uh as long as you have your state id actually and if you're 21 and up you can actually go to the store and get some marijuana but on this case i have this this is different kind of taking marijuana i'm not saying that i'm taking marijuana you know like i do this i do marijuana i do hardcore drugs no okay no this is a gummies so [Music] marijuana marijuana is so broad guys marijuana is so broad uh some people believe that it can cure cancer can cure illness it can cure epilepsies and stuff like that so they made a different bunch of products that have thc on it because they knew they thought that marijuana can help alleviate you know pain stress anxiety and some illness and you know some people can just smoke that [ __ ] you know some people cannot just smoke and feel the effect some people needs to drink it some people needs to have gummies like this to feel the full effect of the thc so in this case i have these gummies right so man i'll make another video on this marijuana thing okay so for today's video i just want to go ahead and test this out and uh see what will be the effects on me after an hour so basically this is just a gummy it's like you know it's like gummy worms but it doesn't shake like worms and it says here at the back activation time is 45 minutes cannabinoid edibles can take after two hours or more to take effect so that's just another warning but yeah man enough of the talk i'm gonna go ahead and try this thing out so i'm gonna go ahead and try whoops oh crap i'm gonna go ahead and try this mango flavor okay and then we'll see what will be the effects are right now i'm clear i just i'm good i just had water so i didn't i didn't have no alcohol i didn't no nothing you know and i've tried an edible before i would probably recommend edible than smoking on marijuana but enough of the talk let's go ahead and try this edible let's go ahead and try this up let's open this thing up come on it doesn't taste any let me get one of these shout out again to jj man thank you for this um thank you for the edible let's go ahead and try this thing out so i think 50 milligrams each for one of these um gummies so this the gummy right there that's the gummy that's it you know it's a regular gummy [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] hmm it's sticking in my my teeth alright so right now it's [Music] um right now it's 3 44. i know if you guys can see that it's just too bright but it's 3 44. man come on bro it's 3 45 right now probably don't see that but it's 3 45 so in about an hour so i would say about 4 45 i might feel the effect i don't know but we'll see and uh yeah man let's see what's going on let's see what's gonna happen [Applause] it tastes like mango tastes like gummies it actually tastes good but yeah let's see what's gonna happen and i'll see you guys in an hour [Music] peace [Music] what is up guys we are back it's been an hour an hour and 10 minutes no an hour and five minutes the time right now is for man why why it's 452 guys it's 4 52. all right so i just ate this one an hour ago but i didn't feel any effect i mean i don't know i don't know i just didn't feel the effect um i'm not sure if it's 50 milligrams per one gummies so i didn't really feel the effect on this one so yeah i'm a little bit disappointed because you know i thought there was something on it i thought i was gonna feel it immediately but it's been almost an hour now nothing really happens nothing really changed i still feel normal i still feel the same so yeah i mean i mean it's worth a try and uh shout out again to jj for giving me those um gummies thank you so much brother i appreciate it uh yeah man so the taste is good the effects not there but hey man it is what it is so yeah pretty nice so yeah man that's about it that's about the video i just really want to try this out see what the

"-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you

"HEmFedrVi4A": "welcome everyone to episode 2 of fruit snack rating today we have something a little different last time we did little mini bags and today we're doing the full size bags that have different flavors our first contender is one that i will admit i've had before this one here it is the welch's island fruits fruit snacks and i have to say this is honestly one of my favorite fruit snacks i've ever had the flavors are so much different than any other fruit snack i've ever tried because it's completely different fruitless fruits like there's kiwi and papaya and grapefruit it's unlike any other fruit snack so but i'm going to try and keep a level head keep it all balanced and equal and go in unbiased but anyway our second contender is welch's strawberry now i didn't really think it through when i got these i didn't really realize they were all the same flavor the whole you know draw of fruit snacks a big part of it when you're when you're rating them and grating them i feel is the variety of the flavors and just have one flavor i feel like that kind of nerfs it its potential right from the start like i can't hold it on the same level if it's all just one flavor it's not good but moving on third contender is a little different it's not necessarily a fruit snack per se it's actually a gummy bear but i figured it was close enough i figured there's not enough i don't have access to enough fruit snacks to keep this channel exclusively this this series exclusively for fruit snacks and not just like any kind of fruit snack gummy type snack so the third contender is black forest gummy bears and first i will try my queen that i've tried before it's it's really hard for me to not just like put a handful in my mouth every time because they're all such good flavors but i think this is like a guava or a kiwi because it's dark green flavor and it's just so juicy so fruity it's a flavor that i've almost never had it tastes like kind of star fruit to me it's amazing we got these little guys excuse me i think they're meant to be papayas it's just such exotic fruits um it's just so many conflicting i'm not conflicting actually they're all so different but you can just grab a handful and they all mix together and they're so perfectly sweet not too tart not too sour not too overpoweringly flavorful it's nice and soft and gentle gosh i gotta stop next up we have the weak competitor the welch's strawberry after walter's performance in the last episode um i don't really know how to feel because it did very poorly was the third on the list but these welch's island fruits are tremendous and if these strawberries are as honestly disappointing as i'm expecting them to be then i it's just i'm getting such mixed messages from this company you know they're very soft very springy i think the flavor is gentle not overpowering of course i would like some variety i feel like they could have interspersed this with some kiwi or something some i don't know maybe a blueberry truffly balance it out maybe even like a raspberry if you want more reds in there i feel like they could have diversified this a lot and made it a better experience but as it stands the flavor is pleasing it's not too strong it's not too sweet it's not too sticky in your mouth so that's pretty good i think i'm pleased to see that welch's is is doing good today but next up we have the organic black forest gummy bears i feel like i've had these before but not this exact type the ones that i had were like shiny and these are kind of like chalky in appearance almost oh gosh it kind of tastes like feels like they're chalky because there's like a layer of something weird and sweet on them like some sweetener it doesn't taste like sugar exactly it's like oh it almost tastes like stevia to me yeah that's a very unpleasant little tang i don't like it oh i might have to spit this out i'll try the yellow one nope nope nope nope nope nope disgusting okay yeah those are really really bad i don't know i've had really good experiences with black forest before i've had some really great gummy bears i i shared a bag of black foreign gummy bears with one of my co-workers before i left work to come to college and that was such a great night we really enjoyed those bears we like threw each other threw them in each other's cars as we were standing in the parking lot talking and we were both every time like god what are you doing it's gonna melt in there because it was summer time it was a mess but they were delicious little bears these i don't know what this chalky powder is on it if again they could just be old or they could be a different line of them a different batch of them that just had some malfunction but those are really quite bad really really quite bad so i wasn't really expecting this honestly i thought that the black forest would certainly be second place and strawberry certainly last but coincidentally as it turns out the list of three ordered they're already in the order first is island fruit second of strawberry and third is the organic gummy bears because these are just so amazing all of them are so flavorful they're so perfect amount of sweet perfect amount of tart perfect amount of fruit flavor like with the um match ones that won the last episode they were very good very juicy very soft and delicious but the orange ones were overpowering you would put them in your mouth and it's suddenly like your entire roof of your mouth is coated in like orange oil it's kind of almost kind of greasy a little too much you know but these are just where it's at the edges are so soft and pretty and the colors are so vibrant and every flavor when you put it together it all just melds in this delicious tropical flavor strawberry surprised me today i'm not going to lie i came in with low expectations i was not expecting much for her i was thinking that it was gonna go pretty bad i'd i'll be honest but i mean they're not my favorite and i'll probably never buy these again i'm never going to seek them out i'm never going to crave this and be like oh man i really need i'm really craving some of that never is that going to happen but the flavor is pretty nice it's not bad in comparison to the third place loser with its cloying sweetness and this overpowering horrible aftertaste it's impossible to even pretend like they hold a candle to strawberry even though strawberry isn't very good because these are actively unpleasant and these are just neutral and boring well that was a roller coaster but this concludes episode three two of fruit snack rating that's embarrassing we're gonna pray and that didn't happen this concludes this episode like and subscribe and leave a comment and do all those things that people do on youtube.com

We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay. (laughing) - But I'm going to call\nhim Denas when I see him. It's Sundance. - So that's the only famous\nDenis you could find on Google? All right, so you've marinated some stuff. Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about. Oh, this is also a smoor, which means it is a Good Mythical More that was voted on by the Mythical Society. And what you guys have\ndecided that we should do is readily, are sprayed with water every time they touch their hair or beard. This was suggested by\nGinger Snaps, not the brand, the mythical beast. - The majority of you\nvoted on that suggestion. And, but the, the, I mean-- - I don't touch. I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess. Cause I don't want to\neat too many gummies. - I can't tell, all I taste is gummy bears and they're good. - [Stevie] You want a\nthree, two, one on it? You really, you don't\nhave any kind of guess? It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking? (background laughs) - [Stevie] What? - What? - I wasn't listening to\nwhat you were saying. - It's not something-- - [Stevie] This soda has\nbeen featured on this show in a prominent way in this recent season. It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there.

Vintage Cactus Cooler\nsoda mesh trucker hat in EX, unused condition. It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick.

little bit hard a little dinosaur Stegosaurus all the cool things in school this mold right here is from the road baking mine and if you're interested in it I'll put a link down below and what's cool is they have these little squeezes yeah Oh new step ones a little bit of prep Lindsey hold this cute little Bowl okay and then you want to spray it because these are very detailed designs and you want to stick he want him to pop out easily all right just just move it over there I don't want to get you too bad oh geez here we go here oh oh put the tape on this okay that's done and now Lindsey which one do you want to make first which flavor I'm kind of feeling the strawberry puree okay all right so I'm gonna hand this over to you okay and a medium sized saucepan so we're gonna add the three ingredients pour it okay yep everything oh it smells so good it'll delicious smells like just pure strawberries fresh movie though it it smell is this literally just a blended up strawberry or pureed strawberry yeah that's it that's amazing okay and a little bit of gelatin shake that in there shake shake deep deep deep deep DDP and honey it's a little oh my gosh that looks so good I can't strawberry and honey I can freeze that and just do a popsicle right now we could oh no no now your next cookbook I like to stay focused ro okay okay cool so di Lindsey I'm gonna have you do this it's super easy just whisk together those three ingredients together get everything mixed in get all blended and then we're just gonna let it sit for five minutes to bloom once it's blue we're gonna take that little pot and head over to the stove I could tell that you like your advancer cuz you're like you have such good posture and you look so pretty when you're doing it I'm like it's like a little little lady I was imagining pictures cauldrons call me witches but I'll take your magical [Laughter] okay my arms getting tired I need to get on your leg at work okay I'm good good we'll let it sit let it use this this little muscle right that's how bakers are so buff I mean really though we've already got the arms as Baker's right yeah we need the core in the squat so sometimes I like to do these when something's microwaving or baking because it really helped my arms are getting a little strong from all that whisking and also I have to carry around cookie all the time like your cute little dog Luna I can tell her with my finger is cookie she's 25 pounds right now so Lunas six pounds so that's a big difference like cookies like a you-know-who bowling balls I remember when we were at Justine's birthday and we were like standing around holding hot dogs just talking and I wanted to feel like a part of the group right so I pick up cookie this huge double bowling ball after a while like am i starting to lean back just like oh oh thanks Mike see this is what I looked like at the party oh yeah same girl I mean the other day so we're I mean at all okay clean clean she just don't kiss it it really wants to kiss your face and you didn't let her I'm sorry about it all right it's been sitting for five minutes and it is only bloomed look at that it's thickened it's a little firmer now we're gonna take this over to the stove on a medium heat and we're gonna let it simmer for just a couple minutes and then we bring it right back here okay do it girl okay it's like Oh medium we hurry iris yeah here I'll go oh as it starts to warm up it it gets all liquid me again just whisk a couple minutes then we take it back over here we take the little dropper and put it in the mold done all right we just took this off the stove be careful it's really hot and we're taking these little teardrop urse which come with it and you just you suck up a little bit and then put it in the mold I love the way this smells by the way isn't this so cute so we just oh yeah it doesn't have to be perfect and you're just gonna keep doing this fill up the whole tray and once it's full we're gonna pop these in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour and while it's chilling we're gonna make another flavor okay here we go okay here we go in Oh a G in the fridge so while those fruit gummies are chilling in the fridge this is perfect we're gonna make two more flavors and I want to eat these like now yeah this is perfect so we can make two at a time we can do these together so I gave you the grape if that's okay Fanta I've got the orange the orange juice so pour in your grape juice and I'm gonna pour in the orange juice to a pot a little bit of gelatin or the gelatin first is it important to put the gelatin in first you can put it in second but I like to put it in first so it starts reacting right away so we don't have to wait as long for it to glue and then remember for these recipes I'm using maple syrup instead of honey this is just a sweet knit some nice natural sweetener I always like cooking with whenever I can honey or maple syrup I love that about your recipes actually they've been getting more and more like that over time and even you know if you're vegan and you don't want to use a gelatin they have a lot of gelatin replacements oh nice you could customize it you can make it for you all right let's mix these up and let them sit for five minutes I feel like this is a mix challenge I know who can with faster let me get my posture [Laughter] all the squats farther go home I just learned that the farther out you put your knees like the war at burns okay let us sit for five minutes five minutes to recover okay whoo litter bloom and let her burn bloom man a bloomin bird only a witch would have this and she's trying to block it with her body you show nymphal back your apples you found me out why do all those out there like big dip in the big boys oh man they're like okay now do the same thing is before I get your low-tier droppers and just plop them in the bowl oh yeah this is a little more liquidy this makes me want to drink a huge glass of orange juice right now it smells so good oh dear Oh Wendy you're so fast well I just had an accident but you know it's nice about this dropper accidents are very easily fixable yes yeah yes you can just flick it off or once they're done setting you just peel it so don't even worry about spilling you could use a little spoon I just like the dropper as they make a lot easier but you could use a spoon okay well no rush but I'm gonna play with your pup so Q are you adorable girl what a beautiful color like she actually is like blue yeah she's like this beautiful like blue-gray color and she's got these funny Sharky want some I know it kind of reminds me of like a Rottweiler oh my gosh Lindsey how did you beat me you really did such a good job motivation to play with the puppy is like I got a hurry you think I'm moving I'm gonna go so fast that I love her you're just also I think that's what makes you such a good you know baker and so inventive is the fact that that's your process fact that you're very meticulous you're very detail-oriented it's so and it's good it's slow it's good and that's why your cookbook is amazing I know everything you do amazing cuz you don't speed through it alright lanzhi let's put these in the fridge okay oh then we'll pop them out oh look at you look at you here I'll come help you not let me go the dog okay the gummies have chilled we've popped a few out here's what they look like look at they hold the shape so perfectly you can see all the little details and they're really easy to get out because this is a silicone mold and not a hard old like a like a metal one the metal ones are harder because you can't do this the silicone ones you just push them and boom look at that I have one Rhino I want to eat a dinosaur mmm I really want to try a strawberry one me too I think the puree one is gonna have the strongest flavor all of these gummies are a fruit gummy so the flavours are light and very natural but if you would like them to taste more like a candy like the gummies you see at the store like the gummy bears you add a little measurement of citric acid it's so good it makes it a little bit more tart and tastes more like a gummy bear so it's really up to you especially for kids whatever one you'd like you can't go wrong tada here are they delicious little fruit gummies that we've made today the recipe is in my new cookbook and I'll be putting a

healthy-looking strawberry I almost tripped over both the dogs okay so we got this is my children sprinkles this is before before what before they're in the fridge yep this is before and um well we're gonna put them in the fridge probably for like half an hour see how that does well the strawberries are cooling we are going to work on the gummi bears and we have to we have half a cup of water here just making this well we wait just kidding so we got a thing a blue jello you use the whole three ounce thing a blue jello what are you doing and then we got through this gelatin and you actually only need a tablespoon of the gelatin and we're gonna put it in this water that's on low heat and then we're gonna mix it up till it's all blended together Oh be very careful of it get all that okay and then we have one table Suzie doesn't this remind you of jelly bath or slime bath it does good job you'll stir that up probably why that got these gummy bear molds for Christmas so you want to try them out yes so we just decided to make something that meters whoa all right so he got it all dissolved I only need one of the droppers on one of the trays so start out with just one dropper and then you know what suck it up in there and then fill it fill up to make sure it's filled all the way up yeah we will definitely only need one mold yeah okay [Music] we get it filled up almost one of our trades oh so now we need to put it in the freezer for about a half an hour all right so we will leave this in here for a half an hour and come back and try them did you get out of your hair good I put the plate a little bit but there's someone pretty good everybody sees my reaction to this gummies look see it's like legit gummy bear oh good not remember three jello he's flying jello oh they're pretty sticky huh you want Roman yeah okay argue the nation but they taste nothing like this homie here see it looks good though yeah so if you guys want to want to try this they don't taste like legit gummy bears but they do take oh good yeah I think they'll be the front of these I think if we leave they didn't green if we leave them in a little longer I think they might be more like gummy bears we'll see turn three the frontier of green they are delicious though with peace love and stay great bye [Music]", "ufr2SU18_WE": "[Music] the cbd gummy bears are ideal for cannabis lovers who love to try

strawberry that's all I have and then and use not jealous because it's the classic and it is flavored so I'm just going to put these two other envelopes back in the alley my fingers sorry oh no I just broke a nail hold on I'll be right back step one is to put your water to a boil out that really hurt by the way you want to put a finger so basically just dump both of them in two different bowls three flavors I'll be back with the next step I'm adding new line one to the tamper and you put over there then take and then I'm gonna take my strawberry strawberry into the bowl and pour your hot

for dummies oh and you like jello I'm just gonna fill up like the berries with some green and some of the Dolphins or whatever you want to pretend that they could be because imagination counts right people don't let anybody ever tell you that you don't you can not have your own imagination this gel is very sticky I'm gonna have to wash my hands after I make these sticky it's getting really sticky so it's sticking my fingers together huh too sticky and this is something to do during quarantine by the way so I'm doing basically if you have shaped ice cube trays first letter silicone or that are plastic that would also work to make gummies just make sure you don't burn anything well the silicone probably won't burn but the plastic - now I'm just doing some green dinosaurs but you can milk these and make anything you want basically out of them like you can make a little sign with powdered sugar I'm making three rows of dinosaurs I mean three rows of green and three rows of the pink for now okay let me wash this I also need to wash my hands [Music] sorry enough but now I'm doing cake and back and this time you guys can actually see the pink a lot better cuz they're on the bottom rows

hour I know these are gonna be really big and they're really big for years but it will actually help us get all the gelatin so I'm gonna make some like chocolate bar things out of the gelatin some racecars like a Santa ladybugs a nut crack I don't know anymore but I'm gonna start Oh I'm doing Oh I mean I couldn't find another service so I didn't have to keep washing it but I'm just gonna use the limes spoon that I started with put the gelatin therefore my guys I actually can find another store in just no wolf be careful I'm not putting it boom oh because if you put too much power it will squirt out of them be very careful when you do this please please please be very I mean so sorry this is blurry my camera is currently dirty from the big splash that just happened I did finish just

with another west coast we tour review 2020 edition today super excited because man i visited steezy downtown la the other day picked up a nice group of items these little assorted bits beets i'm not sure 20 pieces a bunch of different colors bunch of different flavors i'm super excited hundred milligrams in this container are you guys ready it says low calorie gluten free let's see what else what else what else 4.78 milligrams of serving this package actually only has 95.54 milligrams of thc so always read the packaging because you're not actually getting a hundred it says total 100 milligrams on the front on the sticker 95 milligrams dhc take a view of the colors of these gummies i'm pretty excited got the green pink orange blue purple red look got a bunch of these here look at that red one oh almost dropped it so you know an assorted colors here super excited let's check it out one i'm gonna eat two of these today one bite i'll talk about the first one two bites we'll give it the official score you guys know what's good and the rules here we go first one what color should we go with chris what do you think purple i like your style i'm a grape guy so this is perfect this is a great way to start i'm really judgy about grape flavored [ __ ] it's really it's really sticky like it tastes good it's light it's not a great flavor at all unfortunately i don't know what flavor it is but it's really sticky it's slightly sweet it's berry something i don't know if it's grape does it say can just say what the flavors are peel here let's see let me see if let me see if there's something here peel here ah here we go here we go here we go here we go oh yep it has the flavors oh it's not grape it's black cherry interesting okay so the flavors black cherry orange green apple strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry cool now that i know that just ate the black cherry that was pretty good it's a sour black cherry against your sour so it was slightly sour all right that makes sense way more sense second color blind taste test don't tell me don't tell me what i get all right now you guys see here we go what'd i get chris i can't tell you oh all right so i have no clue what [Music] strawberry okay hmm all right so very chewy it's stuck in my tooth it makes me think of the consistency between like the dots times starbursts and chewiness and like stickiness and like how you have to get it off your teeth it takes like some effort but also there is a very much like a uh uh what is it the uh sour patch kids yes there's a very much a sour patch kid aspect to this it's not quite sweet enough i can't give them that these are slight these are definitely tart i wouldn't say they're sour though at least for the black cherry and the strawberry uh those two again let me see do these they don't really have individual smells let me see what we got here presentation beautiful front label sticker there that was in the top of the lid i love it they've got the warning labels on it all appeal you know i gotta say the steezy does a great job of presentation i'm going to give these a solid 10 out of 10 appeal um sour gummy cubes i'll give it a 9.5 there's nothing that makes me feel like this is healthy whatsoever um color super wonderful branding the colors of the gummies are all super on point like i feel like that's all good 10 out of 10 smell definitely don't get me if these gummies had individual smells with each of the gummies i'd give it a perfect score but they don't and because of that that's ah man to me that's like a 7.5 on the score because there's just no smell to this jar whatsoever so it's just smells like sweet candy although that's what candy should smell like that's why they get a the 75 because it's like okay cool they get the candy smell right like that's it but like i really needed like five different flavors of stuff uh potency let's see uh total of 100 milligrams thc but this pack specifically only had 95.54 a little disappointing right but to be expected right it's hard to get this 100 dialed in if that's not your model so it's tough um potency i gotta give you guys you know it's not a hundred milligrams it's five milligrams less i'm going to give you guys an eight out of ten that's kind of hurting there taste i did like the black cherry i thought the strawberry made sense afterwards it was nice and light and kind of tart uh taste uh uh you know to read the full to get the full taste score i'll have to eat a few more of these and then make sure you guys check back into the written review or in the description that'll kind of help that but for now i'll give it a give it a i'll give it a 7.5 out of 10. um not not that sour and not a very strong flavor that made me know exactly what it was if that was grape would have been hyped but it wasn't um purple usually goes with a grape flavor let's see let's see let's see experience experience so far is around a 7.5 to an eight out of ten again i wish there would have been a smell i wish there would have been greater flavors kind of hard to identify what all the flavors are unless you peel the sticker off i was always bad at reading directions i assume lots of other people are makes it going to be tough for them to figure out what these flavors actually are so in my experience i'll give it a i'll give it an 8 out of 10. more information there is a lot of information on there i notice again steezy does a great job of uh you know educating and teaching and they're good with pads and vendor days that they stop all out of their stores so i give it to them for that it's tough i'll give them i give them the information was there it was peelable i'll give them a nine i'll give them a nine out of ten what i recommend i would recommend probably some other different versions of these gummies i've had better ones than these from them but i definitely would recommend this 8 out of 10 solid recommendation the only time i would recommend switching away from this is if there's a specific flavor you want or if you feel like price point it's kind of that kind of choice for you or you know maybe get a better deal so that uh overall i'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 but we'll cut we'll also see what our slider method kind of aggregates it to once we enter in all the exact scores so stay tuned i appreciate you guys for all the love we've got the steezy bits here 20 assorted flavors a lot of good ones a nice sour candy look at all these cool colors that we've got here um i love the experience man stevie you guys do a great job i look forward

as promised I'm coming to you today to deliver the keto gummies and if you are not subscribed to my channel please subscribe and leave me a comment thumbs up on the video if you like it and if you want to see the keto gummy recipe this please stay tuned [Music] okay guys back with the recipe for keto gummies I have all of my stuff right here I'm going to read you the recipe I'm going to show you what I have and then we'll get on with it so basically the recipe says one small box of sugar-free jell-o one packet of gelatin powder and 1/4 cup of water okay and so I'm going to show you exactly what I have here ignore the washer in the background if you hear it I'm going to make four different kinds of gummies of gummy bears and whatever I can but I'm going to show you what time I have I have a these are all kroger brand no they're not all kroger brand okay I have a Kroger sugar-free raspberry okay so we'll have raspberry gummies I have a Kroger sugar-free orange orange gummies I have a jello brand sugar-free lemon and I have a kroger brand sugar-free strawberry oh I have five cards actually I may omit one I'm not sure important make four different cons I like different colors so I may take out this strawberry and then I have kroger brand sugar-free line so I'll probably do a lime a lemon orange and I think I'll do strawberry and I'll take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito gummies adorable hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this and leave me a comment if you are going to make some of these bad boys there's a whole bunch of different flavorings you can use if you choose to use like the unsweetened jello and stuff like that so yeah like and you can use even T to make to make it my not sure how to do that I haven't done it before I'd like to try anyway why didn't answer okay guys thank you for watching I'm gonna put a video up picture up at the end on how I ended up storing these so thank you for watching", "H81YYnKdDbM": "You might have noticed we

it for today guys good bye bye guys", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "Y974-FWoGTc": "[Music] Cheers because we are making the most fabulous candy for grown-ups ever with my DIY Rose a gummy bears you guys my friends are totally obsessed with these they totally taste

show-stopping candy to serve at your next party and if you're not already subscribed to my youtube channel be sure to tap that subscribe button to be the first to see my all-new videos and the best part is you don't have to make one throws a champagne you can do this with red wine white wine regular champagne whatever you like that are super versatile to celebrate with so I made these two ways with and without pink food coloring for a mix of champagne colored gummies and pink gummies and I couldn't help myself I had to add some edible glittery gold stars to really make these Sparkle seriously how fabulous would be PR your next cocktail party yes--why Rose a all day you can put them out in a bowl or a champagne flute even drop them into a glass of rose a or skewer them on a toothpick for a really fun cocktail garnish and if you're not at legal drinking age don't worry keep watching because I'm gonna show you how to make a non-alcoholic version these sparkling gummy bears okay so these are crazy easy to make and as always I'll leave the full written recipe for you guys down below or you can get on my website at Lindsay and baek's calm so first we just place the gummy bear bulbs on a baking sheet and I'm gonna sprinkle some edible gold stars into the molds and I'll leave the link for where you guys can get this online but it's totally optional it just kind of makes them really extra special then we're gonna pour 1/2 a cup of Rose a into a medium sauce pan and sprinkle two quarter ounce packets of gelatin right over the top so if you want to make these non-alcoholic just leave out the half a cup of Rose day and in a quarter cup of cranberry juice with a quarter cup of sparkling club soda so you still get that sparkling gummy bear flavor then just stir this all together and let it sit for a minute so the gels and has a chance to start to bloom then over lo he's just staring a quarter cup of white sugar and if you want you're gonna have a drop of pink food coloring to give it that rosy color then you're just gonna stir the mixture until the gelatin and the sugar are dissolved for the tricks of making these so they stay nice and sweet and boozy is low and slow on the stovetop don't let it get over ninety degrees Fahrenheit so you still get that really intense rosacea champagne flavor shining through and that was basically it now we're gonna turn off the heat but we're gonna leave it on the burner to keep the jealous and warm while we fill up our gummy bear molds so I'm just using a little dropper that came with the mold sweep and also just pour the mixture right on top and use a spatula to kind of wipe away any excess so I got this gummy bear mold online I'll leave a link for you guys so you can get one too but you can definitely just pour the mixture into a regular 8 by 8 inch pan and just line it with plastic wrap that way once it's all firm just pull it out you can slice it up into a little square gumming it so you don't even need the mold at all and they come out totally perfect you got you can kind of already smell the rose day we're just gonna pop these in the fridge to firm up for a few hours or you can just pop them in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes until they're nice and firm and then we can pop them out and give you a try you guys how insanely fabulous to these turn out oh my gosh I love the little stars these are not so cute then we just let them come to room temperature and they are soft and gummy and ready to serve if you're not gonna serve them right away to put them in an airtight container in the fridge make sure they're covered so they don't dry out and get tough and rubbery then just bring them to room temperature before serving and you are all set for the most fun candy ever I can't decide if I like the clear champagne colored ones or the pink rose they ones better they're so cute I kind of like to mix and match and combine them all for a really fun look

I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "fvKzpfkqD7Q": "- [Man] Gummy bear shot glasses. No, we've never made these before, they're super cool, super fun, okay. You've got to try this. We start with some blue gummy bears, packing them into our shot glass mold that we got on Amazon. You have to pack these tight, homeboy. Okay, got 'em all up in there, blue, red, orange, yellow, green. I know some of you are going \"Why would you make\ngummy bear shot glasses?\" Why did man walk on the moon? Because we could! That's raspberry vodka, peach schnapps, what we're making here is\na white gummy bear shot. Sweet and sour, combined\nwith some lemon-lime soda. There are tons of recipes\nfor this out there, so you might see a little variation. Don't call me complaining like \"No, that's not the correct recipe.\" Just roll with it, okay.

cook miss so I apologize if I look like death I'm just getting over since food poisoning so bear with me welcome to the second video today and this is the second video that is new Earth's New Year's Eve inspired so these are some champagne gummy bears and I thought this would be so much fun they do taste alcoholic so if you're too young to drink alcohol or don't like alcohol I wouldn't recommend making me but if you want something that will give you I don't think they'll get you drunk but they're really cute addition to any New Year's Eve party or any Christmas party and they have some gold leaf in them so this is edible gold leaf kind of expensive but if you want to go all out for something special for Christmas or New Year's this is like the cutest treat and it's so fun of putting the gold leaf in the gummy bear containers I don't know why it's weird that way but yeah I think these are so pretty and they're so sparkly and just like something that you totally wouldn't expect with gummy bears and also before we get started I'm doing a Christmas chew and a soon and I forgotten many times asked you guys for questions so I'm a filling within the next few days so if you have any questions that you've ever one to ask me it can be anything um definitely ask me down below and I'll make sure to answer it in the Q&A which is going live on Christmas morning or sometime on Christmas so you know let's get started and make the coming bears so first wrinkle the gelatin into the water and let develop for 5 minutes for the champagne into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until philippe salt sprinkle some gold leaf flakes into the inside of a gummy bear mold and gently pour the liquid on top place them all in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully set for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or package them into little cellophane bags for a New Year's Eve gift or you can pop them into some champagne glasses and top with some champagne for a cute sparkly touch to your cocktail and you are done so thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe I make sure to stay tuned tomorrow for an only cookies recipe we're getting so close to Christmas I can't believe it's almost finished this is like the busiest month of my entire life so I'm definitely going to collapse and maybe like not get up like a day after this is over anyways I love you guys so much and I will see you tomorrow for an all new recipe so last not last year two years ago you guys when I made this champagne jellies video I opened the bottle and it like exploded all over my kitchen and I lost like half the bottle of champagne and it was a bigger bottle than this so I'm quite glad that why am i happy I don't know well I'm hopeful that it's not gonna happen this year Oh the scariest thing my heart is racing so much oh my god such a baby [Music] even how you do it I don't even know oh my god oh my god Paddington I'm scared help me he's playing he's such a little turret okay all right the worst thing that's gonna happen is like I'm gonna lose an eye and that's not very good um oh my god oh well let's fight enough technically it can't go anywhere right yeah okay so please holy crap I'm trying so hard not to swear I can feel it release it oh my god sorry for nothing we're good", "XK1PuIkrEk8": "[Music] d [Music] d hey girl hey what is up you guys it has been a minute since i've done a slime video with me not uploading much in december in general i didn't upload any slime videos in december i don't even know if i uploaded a slime video in november i probably uploaded one in october last time today i decided to come back with a fun slime video not just any slime video an edible slime video i did one of these also months ago so basically turn this candy into slime challenge last time we did three to four candies and today we're doing three more this is a fun little series part two today the candy that we're gonna be turning into slime is skittles tootsie rolls and gummy bears so let's get to it let's see how these turn out i get a little bit nervous about these just because edible slime is so so much more complicated than not edible slime also you guys i just want to mention i am very aware that my fire alarm battery needs to be changed i think it just went off yes it's annoying i'm so sorry you guys i get it girl i think it's annoying too okay so first slime we're gonna attempt to make is a skittles slime we have a skittles right here let me tell you we had to do some research for some of these because not always will candy turn into slime it's not always slimeable so alex behind the camera she actually separated all these by color i can't believe you separated all the skittles literally all of them it's an even amount it's an even amount for all the colors that is incredible that's a point for skittles because we've separated colors before in the past with different candy and a lot of times for some reason like the best ones like they have the least red or you know things like that which is kind of crazy but that's the tea guys so what you're gonna need to make these is sour skittles we're gonna need some cornstarch we're going to need a coffee grinder yes we're gonna need coconut oil and we're gonna need some marshmallows okay so we have our coffee grinder this is uh the mr coffee one and i believe we had gotten this for another video and video and we even bought the skittles and everything and then we didn't end up we got and then we ate all the skittles but uh we're gonna use it today so we got a coffee grinder okay so we're just gonna put our skittles in here one color at a time it's going with purple and then we're just gonna pop her in and then you just press down it's dust like in seconds we could use this to crush up hot cheetos too and stuff whoa oh my gosh this is a lot do not ever stick your fingers in this guys or anything electrical like this at all the fact that this turned it into straight up dust a skittle you guys i feel like skittles are you know that first crunch it's literally kinetic sand do you see that it literally looks like sand like kinetic sand crazy okay so now that our skittles are dust it's time to go on with some marshmallows okay in order to make our skittle slime i actually tested this a few times to get the perfect measurements because there was not really any measurements for this and also it really just depends on how much you're making so what ended up working for me was one coating the bowl with coconut oil and then i added marshmallows and to calculate the measurements for that the bowl is a medium size and i filled up about a fourth of that cut those in the microwave for 10-15 second intervals until it melted completely so once the marshmallows were done and melted i also went ahead and each time i went in with a different color i pulverized them again since it's sugar it starts to solidify and kind of like bind together so i pulverized it again and then mixed it into my marshmallow mix got in there with a fork a spatula very sticky situation with any type of slime making whether it's edible or not you're gonna get your hands dirty and then you go in with some of that cornstarch and then it starts to come together like a slime so i started adding in cornstarch a little bit at a time and started to come together also adding cornstarch to your hands to the countertop to the parchment paper whatever surface you're working on is great and then adding a little bit of coconut oil to your hands helps it to not stick so much knead it up and you're good to go say if you want to put it in the fridge for another day you can actually store it into a deli container or anything airtight is good then you can go ahead and just take that out put it in the microwave for five seconds at a time until you get that soft smooth slimy texture it's also a very thick consistency so this would definitely i can't see this sticking to kids as long as you put some cornstarch on their hands and some coconut oil i feel like this definitely is very very manageable [Music] they actually still feel warm which is great they still feel very puddy like even in the containers these look so good if i was just looking at this i would straight up think that their butter slime i just want to show you when i poke into it so pretty i also think this is my favorite one because it smells like lemon heads you guys you guys oh you guys look how cute oh my gosh well since i made this with my hands i think it's safe to eat so let's try this out wow you actually cannot taste the marshmallow straight up skittles and they're sour too next up we're gonna be making tootsie roll slime and i'm really excited about this one one because we could just throw the whole thing where i gotta go you know we're not making five different colors i feel like that's what took so long with that one so this is actually a very very simple method and if you watched my last video of turning candy into slime this is a similar method to the bubble gum tootsie rolls are so underrated i feel like they're so underrated and i only see them during halloween we love her we're popping this bowl in the microwave this is probably the easiest one here that's all you do guys anything taffy i feel like usually is very very very stretchy so this should be a good one let's pop this in the microwave for about 10 to 15 second intervals until we have it nice and dough-like okay so after about 45 seconds you can see that it's very dough like oh it smells this smells so good you guys i'm sure my entire house right now smells like candy so soft this literally feels like brownie batter in slime form also the gloss the gloss so an option for sticking is some cornstarch or coconut oil also if you don't have cornstarch you can use powdered sugar but it's really it's the same thing oh my gosh that looks perfect it literally looks like brownie butter slime like slime are you kidding that is the easiest candy slime i've ever made 45 seconds and it smells incredible okay this stretch unbeatable okay skittles really could never i mean i love you skittles but tootsie roll like are you kidding okay this is crazy soft i don't really even need the cornstarch anything it smells so good it just melts so easily but it stays warm it's like you could play with this endlessly this is like the perfect taffy consistency for an edible slime this is probably the one i would recommend out of all of these if you want to just make one that's like really easy and you want to impress your kid and just be like look at this we're turning this into slime like nothing so effortless literally the only way i could describe this is if you magically turn brownie batter into slime that's exactly what it feels like so stretchy for quite a bit it looks like it's gonna take a while to cool down also if you're making these of course you know like you're making them so that you eat them so you might not need batches like this you might need smaller batches if you're just making them to eat them with your kids or you know something fun this is really cool guys tootsie rolls really recommend these last but not least we're making gummy bear slime i'm really surprised that i've never made gummy bear slime before because i feel like gummy bears and content is like a thing in my last video i was able to make clear edible slime with sour patch kids so i'm assuming that this should also be able to make clear slime there is some gummy bear slime recipes where you make them with powdered sugar but the only thing about that is i feel like gummy bear slime should be clear so we're gonna pop these in the microwave for 10 to 15 second intervals just as we have been doing mix them in between until we have a nice melted slime and then we'll go from there parchment paper down coconut oil this helps it from not sticking to the surface and also it'll help with being able to actually control it in your hands okay 45 seconds in they're starting to melt oh wow this looks really good oh wow okay melted melted melted it is definitely a little hot right now to manage but i could tell that it's gonna be a good one i'm gonna let it cool down first though because you don't want to burn ourselves i'm gonna let it cool down a little bit it is it honestly doesn't really even feel that hot it actually goes like a massage it feels so good it's kind of giving me lava vibes almost this is definitely slime i don't know if i put too much oil but it's not like binding as much but look how crazy this is i mean the stretch is endless okay this is crazy stretching right here that's a lot of stretch all right guys that's it for this uh candy slime challenge you know what my favorite one hands down was a tootsie roll it took 45 seconds to make literally and also it was the stretchiest one it smelled like freaking brownie batter i know it's tootsie roll smells like chocolate but it just felt like what literal brownie batter would feel like slime form the tootsie roll was also the cleanest it wasn't messy at all i needed barely any cornstarch i learned that the clear gummy bear one was really easy as well but you still gotta sacrifice the stick a little bit it is gonna be a little bit sticky because it's clear but it was also pretty fast i feel like that's more like a gooey experiment the skittles was really cool i loved all the colors i loved how it looked and felt like a butter slime but dang that one literally took a couple hours i like how all these kind of had like their own texture we got like a butter we got a brownie looking one and we got a clear all in all it was a success i hope you guys enjoyed this

guys so much for watching i love you guys and i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "Iy2bgBVFf4Q": "okay since we had a bunch of gummy bears the giant one I was fired up seeing them laying around so we're gonna melt them down I don't know maybe we have hundred pounds of gummy bears we're gonna melt them let's ready give me like a nice thumbnail out of that okay I borrowed this from my grandma she said don't kill yourself does it work okay that's how that works [Music] let's make a giant gummy bear I know you said don't put all of them but I'm not a patient person as you all know [Music] it's melting already [Music] I'm running no more than a month again get this from here inside okay what am I gonna call this for the title should I call it gummy bear soup here here the bubbling let's just stand here and watch it melt sorry that's the content I don't know what else to tell you maybe we should add some peppers the Chili Peppers in it what am i smelling right now I'm smelling a lot of sugar not so much of flavors like a mixture of flavor actually so I can tell this one is worse let me see can you guys smell that we sure doesn't fly in my eye where's the great berry [Applause] [Applause] it's working and faster than is anticipated that's better you have some jalapeno as we can at least make it a spicy soup No are you gonna try it No [Music] smells horrible now oh you know what I think is that sugar burning right yeah that's what that smell is getting closer on this one it's going down like your boss [Music] you think these are shooting up now you see that Zoomer in don't come too close it's firing up like what is it called like a native know the lava thing what is that thing called looking volcano sorry I don't I couldn't think of that like hot lava volcano eruption and that's what's inside your gummy bears all that sugar which you shouldn't be eating it's not healthy at all I mean who wants this in their body if you want this in your body I don't know what to tell you you're going to know that the cholesterol problem diabetes problem there's a piece of wood I don't know where that came from [Music] it's nasty [Music] let's pray don't breathe it get on this side here are you seeing this vlog right I bet if I turn the temperature up in the center it's going to shoot up a little bit higher what's [Music] the bottom is all burned huh that's horrible you want to give it a lumen from over there this area we're shooting up white smoke [Music] okay that's it I think I was gonna do a taste sample taste it's gonna go with the spoon here ah I said earlier don't put this into your mouth but I'm gonna good lots of sugar with some flavor that's all it is if you want a gummy bear just pour some water and sugar together mix it in your home add some food coloring in it and that's what you're gonna get doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out that's it that's the video now we know how to make a gummy bear soup hopefully this was the educational video if you liked it give it a thumbs up subscribe and as always thank you for watching and see you guys next let's go feed this to some people", "ZywiDU5cbKg": "[Music] [Music] [Music]

gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

Bye.", "UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more

chewy delicious these are the Haribo called gold gummy bears I'll put a link to in the description if you want to pick these up but one thing that I'm distressed about in the gummy bear world are the albanese candy sugar-free is sorted through gummy bears particularly the 5 pound bag available on amazon.com check it out I'll put a link to in the description but obviously some of you probably know that many of the reviews have been very critical of the Albanese gummy bears and I would just stop you know I'm deeply pained by it deeply pained and I want to read to you some of these descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak for themselves oh man words cannot express what happened to me doctor genius the gummy bear cleanse you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute enjoy if you are like the dozens of people that tried my order run first of all for the taste I would read these a five so good soft true to taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety I was a happy camper but or should I say bought dutt not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose i gastrointestinal experienced oops like nothing I've ever imagined cramps sweating bloating yawn my worst nightmare I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was all like Schiphol apart compared to what's going on inside then game odd the flatulence heavens to Murgatroid the sounds like trumpets calling the demons back to hell the stench like a thousand rotted corpses vomited I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear succumbing to my own boogers but wait there's more what came out of me bubbling so wonder I don't want old Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I swear my fingers were screaming it felt like delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste 100% was aquitted flammable liquid napalm it was actually a bit humorous for a nanosecond as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible and it went on for hours I felt violated what it was over which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day there was still Tommy out of me that I ate a my wedding in 2005 high five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasty Albers so I told her friends about what definitely enema dig it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands silly woman the horrendous sounds a demon screaming your gut is like an alarm clock without the snooze button do not lollygag when you hear them chant you just run and this should go without saying under no circumstances trust it apart I cannot stress that last part I hope you need my warnings and prepare properly treat this as if it were a blizzard and stocked up on TP so there you have it check out the Albanese candy sugar-free assorted fruit gummi bears five pound bag you're going to want to pick them up there good for you these are good too Peter Miranda out", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow legends of the massive multiplayer

them are you winning I'm playing hey winning are you we're not going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "xGBPnDbSRxA": "hello everybody welcome back so today we're making some vegan gummy bears which means that these are going to grow us but they don't use gelatin so if you're vegan or if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you would like more vegan recipes definitely comment what specific recipe

[Music]", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "DGbITXSfySg": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz and this is the first time you're stopping by and the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much for joining so today I am going to show you how to make real fruit gummies yes made with real fruit so you can use frozen or real arms not frozen fresh fruit that would be the word fresh or frozen I prefer the frozen however like I said you can use either and you can make these yummy yummy cannabutter and fruit snacks now your kids would love these too - the can of butter obviously but if you want to make a really nice candy for your kids just follow the recipe along it just exclude the can of butter and the guar gum and you've got a great relatively someone okay you're sticking fruit in it so we can call it somewhat healthy candy for your kids alright guys so let's jump right into those ingredients what we need to get started and yeah we'll get these made oh one thing I want to tell you if you are because we're using real fruit you do need to use a mold inhibitor lorraine's makes one so it's called Lorraine's mold inhibitor I however do not have it if you do not use a mold inhibitor you will need to keep these in the refrigerator you won't be able to keep them out for like two three weeks on the counter because they will get moldy if you do use the mold inhibitor however you will but I do not have it so I'm not using it but I just wanted to let you know that piece of information so with mold inhibitor you can keep them out and we'll have a lot much longer shelf life without it you're gonna want to keep them refrigerated and get the meat and fairly quickly alright so for our gummy fruit snacks what we're gonna need is about two cups of fruit so I use frozen fruit I just find it's way easier you so you can use any favorite any favorite fruit that's you like I'm using a mixed berry combo so it's blueberry strawberry and blackberries the only fruit that you cannot use is pineapple and I think also mango because it has they contain an enzyme that will not allow gelatin to set but other than that you're free to go so it's said you can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit and I said you can buy one about 2 cups we're only going to use about a cup the extra you can always freeze and save for later then a for our candy syrup you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water now if you have a can of syrup or can of sugar you can absolutely use those as well so again you want to split part of it so quarter cup quarter cup however you want to split that up you could absolutely use those but today I'm just demonstrating with cannabutter now for the rest of it what you're going to need is a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/4 cup of sugar granulated sugar another quarter cup of granulated sugar that we need to premix our clear gel with you're going to need instant clear gel now you don't have to use this if you don't have this you can eliminate it but what this adds to is makes that candy a little softer instead of being so gelatin like it makes it that softer that real candy texture loves of fruit snacks so this is an optional if you've got it if not you don't need to if you do not need you are not using the clear gel eliminate 1/4 cup of the sugar you're going to need three quarters of a cup of ice cold water or blooming your gelatin you're going to need three core three tables sorry three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin so it was three and a half tablespoons on a flavored gelatin and a half a teaspoon of citric acid 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum now this is our emulsifier this is what's going to allow us to combine our butter with our water because that's a water oil mixture and you need an emulsifier in order to combine those two to become one so that they become friends instead of mortal enemies and that is it I believe so for this we don't need any extra color or flavor and that's what's really nice and now another side note for those of you who do not like corn syrup you can make a substitute called inverted sugar which is 2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water boil it to 234 degrees as soon as it hits that temperature removed from the heat put the lid on the pot do not touch it again until it hits room temperature once you're at room temperature it's stable good to go if you want more details about how to do that check out my canna syrup video its basis in its making inverted sugar but with candy syrup just avoid via the can of sugar part that's all ok so that's all we need for our ingredients let's jump into our equipment that we need and we'll get going all right so for the equipment we are going to need two small sauce pans a whisk spatula the hand blender this is for emulsifying if you don't have one you can use the whisk it'll work you just have to want with really really hard but these are definitely an investment if you are going to be regularly making Jam and things like that you're going to need a candy thermometer now check this said I got this off Amazon it's a dual so let's pop the probe it's got that probe and then it's got a probe that you stick in the side which is awesome so I can just slide it in my pot and keep it on the side oh it's great remember the issues I always had before problem solved and you're going to need your distributing bottles these are a sweet sugar or bell I believe yes we took about I got links for all these equipment if you want just to make life easy you can check out what it is in the description there and then just a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or washing down the side of our pot that's pretty much what we need I'm sure I'm gonna throw some extras in there Oh obviously your bowls now a trick that I've learned with my molds is because this is gonna be a loser syrup and I'm gonna do two colors as always put your molds into the freezer that way wouldn't you put as soon as you squeeze it in it kind of immediately starts to solidify that way your colors don't bleed all together so it's a really cool little trick for you all right so let's get all those ingredients put together and let's make some fruit snacks so the first thing we want to do is get our gelatin bloomed and we'll be set aside and waiting for us so we're gonna add our three-quarters of a cup of ice-cold water and three and a half tablespoons of our unflavored gelatin and you just want to sprinkle it kind of evenly over the top or it'll be four envelopes of the gelatin approximately and then you wanted this to mix that in until it is well mixed and there's no lot and then while you're mixing this well how you can kind of tell that your gelatin designs your gelatin may not be thickening as well is while you're mixing it it should start to feel like applesauce the texture of applesauce now I'm feeling this is a little bit thin it's all dissolved and it's still not quite as thick as I'd like it so I'm gonna add about another half a tablespoon to that that's better so that when you mix it up and it's all dissolved that's the texture you want it to be so like a like an applesauce and then I'm just gonna set that aside we'll let that bloom and you need at least a minimum five minutes but it's okay it can wait longer okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare our berries or our fruit whatever fruit that you're using so we are going to put our heat on to medium high okay so the first step is our berries now what you're going to need to do is to prepare your berries ahead of time and we eat you're going to be to macerate them then what that means is I'll whether you're using frozen or fresh put them into a bowl instead about two cups you're gonna add a quarter cup of lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar mix that all around cover it with saran wrap and put it into the fridge for a minimum of two hours if you are using frozen fruits if they're going to be about four hours or you could just leave it on the counter that's no problem and you want one you get will create this really nice syrup and everything will be defrosted dissolve whatever defrosted not frozen anymore do that ahead of time so the first thing I want to do because I've got a lot of seeds and extra stuff I'm just going to strain off the extra juice and those seeds now what you can actually use that juice for don't waste it is if you're a baker you can make a simple syrup with it so add about half a cup of water a cup of sugar boil it for two or three minutes and and that's it letter B and you've got a simple syrup that you can then use on your cakes to cope your cakes with you know those Decorah the american bakers and all that stuff hot they're always putting those things on youtube can do the thing so I'm just getting a little off that excess juice here well obvious I'm not going to get the seeds that I'll get those out after when we when we mush it down when we purify it so I'm going to add a quarter cup of sugar to that get my spatula and we're going to turn our heat on to medium high and you're just gonna mix that around we're just going to bring this to a boil for about two minutes my berries are coming to a boil here don't have better angles so you're just gonna continue mixing that like I said we're just gonna boil that for about two minutes and then we want to get our hand blender ready all right so my little berries and then boiling here for a couple of minutes this is just a soft in the month so that we can purify them puree them not purify puree them a lot easier and if you're using fresh fruit you may need to go for about five minutes and you're going to get your hand blender be very careful cuz it's gonna be hot and be careful if anything splashes up so we are going to puree okay so you're going to continue to blend that until it is completely purified all your fruit is completely blended and there's no major chunks and I'm just going to strain our puree to catch all the seeds and any fruit chunks that did not that did not get liquefied pureed [Music] and then you're just gonna work your puree through your strainer takes a little while just scrape off the bottom a little bit of a pain but you inside necessary to catch like I said if you're definitely using berries or fruits with seeds and also to make sure like I said any fruit that doesn't get purified if you don't want any chunks in your candies so just continue that until you can't get anything nothing else is uh working its way through the mesh and you're just gonna have kind of a puppy puppy mutt mush left okay then once you've got all that we want to measure out about it we're going to measure a cup of our fruit puree a lot worked out pretty even all right okay so now clean this off quickly it's a rinse off your blender because you're going to need it again and we are going to take our pure heart root puree put her back in the pot and we are going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acids help key things to help bring out the fruit flavors the tartness and the fruit flavors as well as it helps prevent crystallization just mix that in and now we are going to you're going to premix up here our clear gel so we're taking a quarter cup of granulated sugar and we're going to take one tablespoon our cereal and it needs to be the instant clear gel the cook you have to cook it for five minutes boil it at a vigorous boil for five minutes and we can't really do that with our fruit so you wouldn't want to use the instant if you are using it they're gonna cut together we're gonna set that we'll just leave that there for a moment so now we are going to add our can of butter to our puree work fruit puree say that ten times quick so first drop in your melted can of butter let make sure to get a roll and sprinkle in a half a teaspoon of gorgeo and you want to try and get that kind of mixed all around not mix like sprinkled even kind of evenly around like so can't really see there that doesn't help sorry and I'm gonna actually angle the camera because I want you to see the emulsification okay so we're just gonna kind of just stir that in a little bit to begin with make sure it's not stuck to the sides and we are going to get our a hand blender [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now this can happen sometimes because I let that gourd sit for a minute or two while I was setting stuff up it started it started to clump if that does that you end up with any lumps in your mixture don't worry about it just run it through a strainer and it will catch those lumps and you're always good [Music] which I am going to have to do here so watch doesn't always happen if you actually mix your gore and your guar gum into a little bit of your butter first it will melt and you won't ever have that issue I kind of forgot that step okay now if you're using the clear gel you need to do this last step if you're not using clear gel just set your puree aside and we'll be moving on to our candy syrup so you're gonna put your pureed back into the pot on medium low heat after you can turn it up to medium we just need to get it keep it up and get it started boiling now this see what an emulsifier does you can see that there's no oil separation between your water and your and your oils the sudden it makes them friends and yes you can use soy or sunflower lecithin you could use about a teaspoon of that I'm just gonna get my wrist candy and once our mixture comes to a boil turn off your heat take it off the heat and we are going to whisk in our sugar and clear gel mixture so I just do a little bit at first get that way now let's get the rest of it in so that what this creates is a softer texture to your candy versus that being more of a gelatin okay so we are going to let this we're going to set this off to the side and now we're going to cook up our candy syrup all right so to our pot we are going to add our half a cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup and our 1/4 cup of water you can just stir that together and turn your heat on to medium high but you're going to stir this until it comes to a boil once it starts to come once it comes to a boil we'll have our candy thermometer and cook it to 275 degrees and this one you're gonna want your cup of hot water and that pastry brush to clean down the sides of your pot Thanks so my search beginning to boil so at this point I'm going to stop stirring and we are going to cook this to 275 degrees now for those who will cook syrup for the first time yours your temperature will come up to around the two 2223 mark and it's gonna sit there for a few minutes this is when a large when your large majority of your water is starting to boil off so it is not uncommon for it to sit at that temperature for a while then once it does start passing that the temperature will start to increase fairly quickly so I've had a few people comment saying but it doesn't get higher than 220 you just got to be patient it will and again just wash down any sugar crystals that are from a farm on the side all right so we're getting there or almost a temperature all right so candies of temp I'm gonna move it put it on the stone here that will help take away the heat quickly so I'm just waiting for the bubbling to stop now we're gonna add in our few fruit puree okay so our bubbling is stopped or it's starting to subside there it's going to a syrup now when you do add to puree it is gonna bubble up again don't worry about that he may bubble up again and we are going to mix this stir it until everything is completely mixed together we're gonna stir this for a couple of minutes until our fruit and our syrup and everything gets combined and that extra sugar gets melted yeah if you find that the syrup is starting to solidify on the bottom no problem just put your heat on to low and we'll get that get that melted and you just want to eat it up and Toba candy from the candy syrup is melted and become syrup again we don't want to start it boiling and I'm gonna use the hand blender on that so that we can get every leave emulsified because we do have the oil you've just dyed it in some more water to that we're gonna use the hand butter to get that all also 5 now have a look if you see you can see it butter any butter rising at the top so you'll see like a little bit of an oil slick I'm gonna add in a little bit more gore gum to get that most of Isis what will happen is that will rise to the top of your candies and you won't have a nice mixture okay so what I'm going to do this time is I'm adding a little bit of oil and I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon of the Gorgo to it just mix it together I see how it dissolved this will avoid any lumping and now we're just gonna add that on to into our candy we get our handy-dandy blender now our last step is we are going to add in our gelatin so we've got our bloomed gelatin this will be warm enough for it to melt we don't want to have it on heat because gelatin will break very easily if it is too high it melts at a warm water bath temperature she's gonna break that up into smaller chunks and you're just gonna can stir that until it is all melted I'm just gonna give it one final mix here with our hand next blender and there we go now I'm just gonna let this sit for a little bit so that we can go so the air bubble isn't that can work out and we can have a clearer syrup mixture so instead of having it like this it'll become clearer so we're just gonna let it sit probably about 15-20 minutes or so and if it does stiffen up too much you can just turn it on low heat to remelt it and then bring the right on one nuke them then when the air bubbles rise up to the top settle at the top here you can just use a little small strainer just as scoop them off or you can also stir gently kind of break them but they're a little hard then as it cools if you help remove some more of those air bubbles is just going circular motion gentle circular motion and see how it'll pull with bubbles kind of all together in the middle then you can just take your scoop and just skim it off the top yeah I'm gonna get my bottles fill up my large one and I use a strainer to help to catch anything else or any extra seeds that mean snuck through or if it's gum if it's become a little too solidified you can just put it up back on the heat low heat or just a couple of minutes just to warm it up a little bit now half of this I'm gonna do is the translucent and the other half I'm gonna add a couple of drops of white to give create a solid background but with the same kind of color so it looks really cool gives you a nice contrast I'm just gonna give this a real quick heat up here so I just heated it up just a little bit you don't want to go heat it too much because you'll break the gelatin so just enough to make it a little bit more syrupy I live my technical terms so I'm just gonna add a couple of drops of the white food coloring mix that in and so see how I create that solid background alright so I just took my molds out of the freezer nice and cold chilled and I'm gonna get my two colors my solid and my clear and just pour yeahjust both together and you can kind of do any design you want what let me get that in a minute or just go half in half or a little marble effect and that's it just fill up your cavities and then you're gonna pop these into the fridge for about two hours and then we'll come back and take them out you can see what they look like alright so it's time to pop these puppies out let's have a look-see there we go nice and easy they pop out now these guys do not get sugar or sour coated these are just the plane the plane kind their regular fruit snacks with a little kick alright it's gonna get the rest of these guys out here you go haven't got clothes so check that out yeah I got the two-tone solid with the translucent they look pretty cool eh let's check out a dinosaur there we go whoa check that one out whoo-hoo all right so I'm just gonna pop the rest of these guys out and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this no sorry so what you're gonna do is if you have used the mold and immature you can let these dry out on the counter for a couple of days if you have not used the mold inhibitor you're going to put them into the fridge for about 24 24 or 48 hours to dry in the fridge then take them out for 24 hours but for the pretty much you'll want to keep them in the fridge in a sealed airtight airtight container I would not keep these out exposed if you haven't used the inhibitor for more than three or four days yeah because you don't want anybody getting sick and because you're using the real fruit and if they will likely get mold on them very quickly all right so that's everything if you have any questions at all or any comments that you'd like to leave please don't hesitate and thank you guys so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "DoRyjd2zKwY": "what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all

month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that

home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description below and also over on the blog I have some free printable recipe cards if you are looking for more education for essential oils grab my free online class in the description

(audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. (laughing) (funky music)", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "xL-2tI7Pd-0": "Oh guys how y'all doing it today's video we're gonna see what happens if you deviate the giant gummy bear for seven days as you can see I have one pound gummy bear here or 624 grams it's obviously the way dehydrator works and basically get the water out of the products I don't know how much water this gummy bear has but I thought it will be interesting to just put it in refrigerator and see what happens [Applause] there you go it's huge this Wow that's pretty big and it very soft you can see I can easily bend it like this I'm trying not to build it too much so I cannot break it it said very cherry flavored gummy bears so I'm gonna try it first pretty good then I just wear it like this here I'm going to turn it on at the highest temperature here a 164 in hate is the highest temperature here and I'm gonna put it for I think it's 23 hours the highest so I'm gonna say it's gonna turn off in 24 hours so each day I'm going to be turning it back on for 7 days [Music] all right it's been exactly seven days let's put this coming beer out and see what happens oh it's kind of warm sharing this table I'm actually quite surprised to what happened to this gummy bear it takes about eight hours in dehydrator to make a jerky but this one was in there for like seven days and look is a little bit hot in me check this out it's completely stuck oh man look at this so it's hard to even get it out from all the sides look it up the upper part is kind of hard but inside whoa oh wow let's see if I can cut it yeah that's not easy to do and cut uh-huh look at that Oh check this out oh now I'm like stuck I'm all covered in a gummy beer yeah check this out oh look at that it's very gooey you know it's like a glue well I'm gonna try it again really good we stuck to the teeth your son uh-huh okay oh yeah now got stuck I can't get up alright yeah so instead of actually being dry out completely it became this super glue looking one and like I said it's like look at it I I'm stuck I can't even oh okay okay so I'm trying to release my hand somehow okay fine I'm just gonna be like this it's okay it's just became totally like groovy and right now like if you look at this you cannot even tell what is it it was a gummy bear but actually you cannot even tell it was a bear because right now is just a big mass of blue and that's actually we just drawn if I'm just gonna put my hands like this oh no it's stuck over there check this out I don't know if I'll be able to get it out maybe it's not a good idea actually ah check this out that is hot I'm still trying to get my hand out of this all right there you go almost well don't try this at home guys look what happens well I don't know how I'm gonna get this out later but it's not gonna be easy this is just crazy you know look at my hands well anyways that's what happens when you put the giant gummy bear in the dehydrator for seven days well I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't try this at home stay safe and I'll see you next time [Music] now is a bad bad idea", "UEt7Gc6nZ-8": "well bloomberg put up an article saying you know uh barcelona leader like says he has grown a virus and the stock dipped three percent instantly and that's back right i don't know i i checked it when i saw your tweet today you outsider trading yeah erica nardini called me quick fast and was like you got to take that down yeah because i think i

that he was like dead silent i thought the video was just gonna end and he's just like cult leaders don't [ __ ] die from covet that's a [ __ ] way to go out go leader don't die there's a t-shirt it's gonna take the [ __ ] national guard to get me out of here all right buy the dip if you want [ __ ] i don't care i'm not going anywhere you think this is gonna [ __ ] take me out i got [ __ ] covered

black couple they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my face and now i have like [ __ ] milk cake and up my [ __ ] hair

back in a very long time and i don't know if people will do next week's episode like we're going to think of something very easy like i'm honestly thinking about doing a sunday bar and giving them like a stuffed animal just for a week just to make it easy on them because they won't come back to the bar if we keep doing the gummy bear that's how bad it was [ __ ] like my stomach is just in a [ __ ] knot right now so just ate that [ __ ] thing vibs after i ate it he was like just you know if you have heart problems you shouldn't have eaten that if you get heartburn you shouldn't have eaten

the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like

can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles

"qMOFwO6hWgQ": "hey guys it's Lisa from the blog farmhouse on Boone comm and today my kiddos all four of the older ones not the baby are going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears so I've

think it'd be helpful for you guys too so if you want to follow along with the crafts I'll link their channel below but today they're gonna show you how to make gummy bears with just juice gelatin and honey so what's great about this recipe is you can use healthy protein rich gelatin I will link the brand that I use below you can get it on thrive market which is where I get mine but you can also get on Amazon it uses grape juice or really you can use any type of juice that you want also if you want to make them something that is an immune booster for the winter season you could add the elderberry crystals that I talked about in my immune booster video so you can follow this exact same recipe but then just add several scoops of the elderberry crystals so that's another way you can add some superfoods into this and make them even more healthy [Music] [Music] first pour a cup of grape juice next pouring two tablespoons of honey [Music] dad your mom heat it up until just Underwood on your stove now we're gonna for 1/4 cup of gelatin into human journey while stirring you have to do so does nothing set make sure to pour it and very thoroughly [Music] now we're gonna put this mixture into our mold we use a dropper or funnel dropper [Music] now we put them in the freezer and let them stick [Music] watching videos five heads you can stop by the blog I'm gonna leave a link below for this resource I'm gonna give you a free printable that will show you some optional add-ons that could make these even more healthy also I will link below the source for these gummy silicone

that's are constantly saying one of two things one when are you gonna be back in the kitchen damn and to never go back to the kitchen man yeah I'm a little sick right now that's why I might sound like this so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a bunch of gummy bears melt them down to make a mega gummy bears first off I got a teddy bear mold rented this yeah I didn't know you could read stuff what I'm like hi there can I get the teddy bear mold no like you want to buy it or do you want to rent what you can rent it so I actually am renting this currently for a dollar ninety-nine a day they didn't have the traditional like gummy bear one so I'm going with this guy four different bags of gummy bears we got green we got red we got yellow and we got blue now I want to show you guys something because I know this is gonna come up this will reuse in a day okay you guys are probably thinking I thought it was like a little gummy bear this is the same material as those little gummy bears traditional stereotype gummy bears that you guys are probably thinking of I was originally at knows the ladies like so what are you doing this was like one of the few times is actually honest through the store associate I'm like I'm gonna develop these data like a huge bear Valachi she's the bigger wise girl Lucy he ate a sack same song with these guys plus it was easier to separate the colors that way so let's go over to the stove and let's melt actually before we do that guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and click the bail free for a limited time right now my subscriptions are educating they're always pretty good guys subscribe my channel let's go okay so to my understanding we got to fill up the pot first and then we're gonna put the bowl in like that and that's gonna kind of heat it up this is a bad idea are we not blocking the air from getting now I'm gonna use a bigger pot I think his bigger brother well I forgot to mention you've got no idea what I'm doing go ahead and turn that up to full okay let's let that boil so we're gonna start off with the red ones okay so it looks like what you've successfully melted a bunch of gummy bears suffer that clump we know this melt a little bit more and we're gonna pour the first layer in our mole I know things get stuck way easier than you think so I'm just gonna put some vegetable oil I don't know if the gummies gonna stick yeah like this is gonna help it's pretty much fully melted looks like sweet and sour sauce here we go now we're gonna do is take this put it in the freezer well that's cooling we're actually gonna start melting the other colors alright next we're gonna do blue I want the bottom of you more blue which is why I poured it we will see down there for our third color we got green that's weird already seems to be melting we can't let water get in there I don't know why but this is so satisfying like the Bears aren't fully melted well you just like stab right through them unless not least yellow my favorite flavor I have favorite color do your thing yellow all right that's three layers in our bear mold the last one is gonna be yellow I better this perfectly look at that I didn't know how much incoming bears together like what the quantity would be when you melt it down but damn that I nail it okay we're gonna let it freeze for about an hour you come back and check on it freeze well my job okay it's been like two hours or like more than that let's see this bad boy oh my god this thing is perfect oh my god it is so stuck to this pan no this feels wrong why does this feel so sexual right now Oh oh my god look at that we even got the face okay stop for sure get to clean my windows after this but it is currently stuck to my window [Music] this thing is so sticky this is a mega gummy bear which is what we've done by melting other gummy bears it's like the Optimus Prime of gummy bears right here yeah I don't know it's her strategy to cutting gummy this is doing nothing oh look at the layers look at the layers beautiful red we've got blue we've got green and then BOOM yellow it's actually really nicely done that is the negev gummy out with sliding already that's the mega gummy bear it's literally the size of my face actually bigger than my face hey it takes you 20 minutes to melt every color of gummy bear it takes like 2 hours to fully cool and on top of that it's loaded with sugar it's now becoming a health nut it was fun it was something I wanted to try for a long time I was so amazed at how well these gummy bears actually melted if you guys want to see a really good picture of this on Instagram follow me at the autocracy scribe my channel if you haven't and I'll see you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "hOfaW5pjKaw": "Guess what we're doing today! Today we are going to make...\nSome super easy gummy Strawberry Valentine Dog Treats! Look at all the dogs in here. We're ready to make some treats. This is actually a really simple easy recipe. There's like three (3) ingredients and that's it . We're gonna show you guys\nhow to make these real quick. if you want to see some more\nValentine's treat videos, there will be a link up in the cards\nand down in the video description below. If you are new, don't forget to hit that 'Subscribe' button.\nClick that Bell to turn on notifications, so that you can be notified whenever\nwe put up amazing new videos. Let's make some treats! You're waiting patiently aren't you? Shelby's like, \"I'm being very patient!\"\n\"Can we just get on with it?\" So the first thing we're gonna want to do is\ntake about a cup, of chopped up strawberries. But first, we'll see if everybody will eat one. How about strawberry, no dip?  Oh, man! Oh!  She ate it! She actually ate it!\nShe didn't spit it out! Strawberry, no dip?\nI know you'll eat it with no dip. How about you?\nStrawberry, no dip? What was that? Oh!  You just wanna lick It?\nWait a minute... We've been here before, haven't we?\nYou liked strawberries! You... Weren't sure about strawberry. You can eat it. You really...\nNo!  This is for Oakley! You can eat it, here!\nHere, try it!  There you go! Or take it in the other room.\nThat's fine too, as long as you eat it! Anyway, we are gonna take one (1) cup of strawberries\nchopped up, and I know this seems silly. We're gonna take it, pour it into this\none (1) measuring cup and then, we are going to fill this measuring cup,\nup with water. We're gonna do that real quick. Now we have our strawberries, in our water. We filled it to the one (1) cup line. Basically what we're doing right now is,\nwe are going to make strawberry juice. It's pretty much what we're doing. We're gonna take the strawberries,\nwith the water in this one (1) cup. We're gonna pour them into this\n'Nutri-Bullet' and turn it into... Like I said, pretty much strawberry juice. (blender sounds) So now we pretty much have...\nStrawberry juice. The dogs are like, \"Wait!  What is this?\"\n\"Can we drink it?\" Kind of, you're kind of gonna drink it.\nKind of! The next thing we were going to do is,\nwe are going to take half (1/2) a cup of water. We are going to heat it on the stove\nand we are going to pour in, all four (4) of these packets\nof plain unflavored gelatin. We're going to whisk it together\nuntil this is all dissolved. That's what we're gonna do now! Alright!  The gelatin is in the water now. We are just going to continuously whisk this... Until it is all dissolved! Now once, it's all nice and dissolved.\nIt's kind of gonna look like this. We're gonna take that strawberry juice we made,\nwe're gonna pour this in, whisk it together and\nremove it from the heat. Now to make it a little easier to pour,\nwe have poured it back into our one cup mixture and now we are going to pour this,\ninto our silicone heart tray. We're gonna fill each\nof these, about halfway. What do you think?\nThings can turn out amazing? They're like, \"We're all really patient!\"\n\"We want to know what this is gonna do? So, we're gonna go ahead and take this and try not to make a giant mess. Oh!  I already made a giant mess! I should probably set\nthe camera down while I do this... And now our silicone tray is full. We are going to take this and we are going\nto put it in the refrigerator for... I would say at least three (3) hours.\nEasiest if you just do it overnight. I'm actually doing it overnight.\nBut I would say three (3) to four (4) hours, before they will actually be firm enough\nthat you can remove them, from the silicone mold. Which means you gotta\nhave some patience, honey! You and the rest of the girls\ngot to have some patience! While we're waiting for those...\nLet us know down in the comments below, what do you guys want to see us, make next? Suggest some treat videos for us to make,\ndown in the comments below. You'll never know, but we just might make\none of your suggestions next! Alright!  So we left them in,\novernight and they are done! They're pretty cool.\nSo these are the strawberry ones, but as you guys saw the video last night,\nI was reminded that we have a few dogs that don't necessarily like strawberry\nwithout something else in it, so I also made some plain ones with\njust a little bit of chicken broth in them. I'm going to show you guys more recipes\non different types of gummies you can do as well. I figured, I better have these (plain) just in case,\nthey really don't want to eat these (strawberry). But, they turned out nice and jiggly. Jiggly! I know you want to try it so bad.\nThey're nice, jiggly and very firm. They smell good! For those of you that are gonna ask,\nif you can eat these as well? Yeah!  If you want to eat them, you can eat them.\nThey're basically 'Jell-o Jigglers'. They don't have any real sugar in them.\nThey just have the natural sugar from the fruit in them. The girls are gonna go ahead and\ngive them a try and see, what they think. Are you girls ready?\nEverybody's ready to see what they think? Alright, let's do it! Sit! So first, we are going\nto give Memphis one of the... Ah!  Wait!\nOne of the strawberry ones. I think she's just gonna...\nThat's exactly what I thought, you were gonna do! Sit! She's like, \"These are great!\"\n\"I will eat them all!\" Can you speak?  Speak! That's a stomp!  Speak!\n(growls) That was really close!  Speak!\n(barks) Yeah!  Good girl! Okay, now you get one of the chicken broth ones.\nCould you eat it a little slower? Yeah, like that.\nNibble, nibble, nibble... Yeah!  Little nibbles. Good stuff!  Was it good?\nWas it good stuff? Alright!  I think Memphis says,\n\"They're a win!\" Alright! Will she eat the strawberry one? You don't want it?\nWant the strawberry one? Maybe? Okay, I'm gonna let it go.\nYou're not gonna spit it out this time. You're gonna eat it? She's like \"Mmm... \"I'm gonna take it over here,\"\n\"and think about eating it.\" Shelby, you want this one instead? Shelby, you want this one instead? She's like, \"Yeah!  I want that one instead!\" (laughter) Yeah, how do they know?\nThat one was better, wasn't it? Hi!  Say hi to the camera!\nThat one was way better, wasn't it? She's like, \"That one was way better.\"\n\"This one...  I'm not so sure!\" You can eat it. It's really edible.\nIt's just strawberry. No?  You don't want that one? She's like, \"I want it, but...\" \"I don't really like strawberries without dip!\" Look at her attempt like,\n\"I could eat this...\" \"But how about, no?\" Alright, let's see if Oakley\nwill eat the strawberry one. Alright, It's Miss Oakley's turn.\nThat's a strawberry one. You're gonna eat that one? Even though it's strawberry? Maybe...  Nah! She's like, \"I don't know...\"\n(chuckles) \"I really want to eat it because,\"\n\"everybody else ate it!\" \"But, I'm not really sure if I should eat it\"\n\"because it's kind of a weird tasting!\" Here, let me get you the other one.\nWanna try the other one? Try this one... She's like, \"Oh!  That's better!\"\n\"That's more like chicken.\" Oh yeah! \nShe's like, \"I can eat this one!\" \"I'll eat this gummy right up!\" \"Maybe I'll try this one again... Nope!\" Yeah!  You're like \"The other one's better, too!\"\nHuh?  Yeah! I should remember, that you guys aren't\na huge fan of strawberry.

Goodbye guys!", "x-QcMKViGEY": "hello everyone how are you today I'm going to be making my little strawberry jalape\u00f1o gummy squares the little gummy treats and they're made with eye makeup with sugar-free jell-o because I have to watch my sugar you can make them with regular jello or even with you use different juices or you could even experiment I'm gonna show you today how to make them you I'm using two packs every six hours and for each pack you're going to use one pack of unflavored gelatin you're not gonna pay attention to rest in the box because you don't want it to turn out to be jello you want it to kind of become e so to put four packs in here and for four packs I usually use a cup and a half of water cuz that'll fill in my little my little bowl and my little hole makes 24 candies in there and then you're just gonna add the water that you need it's not about a cup and a half and then for this one I'm gonna add my jalapenos some jalapeno sauce that I made that me when you turn the top you want to bring it to a hard boiler that's how much recipe online you can explore anything river if anybody knows how to do the chocolate ones I've experimented with those I check it out now I'm gonna let this come to a boil and then I will get back with you okay so you want to let it come to a hard boil wanna keep stirring it the whole time it comes to hard boil let it do that for about a minute and then you want to cut it off and then whatever mold you want to use like I like to do the cherry flavor with I'll put chocolate chips in there or I'll do the strawberries with milk and two strawberries and cream like I said we do the we do we do the jalapeno that will do the strawberry peach jalapeno will do the strawberry jalapeno haven't tried or chopped an arrow I've heard that's really good we use different you could put one of little candies just experiment with it how you like I guess I need to use the sugar free or you could use the regular it's just too however you like whatever you like to do and you just take it after like I said if you use make sure you're stirring it the whole time so it doesn't get stuck to the bottom of the pot because the gelatin will stick and burn especially if you're using milk you want to make sure you're stirring it the whole time when you're using the milk cause you the milk will separate and burn if you're like using chocolate in the mix you want to separate you wanna constantly start - because it'll it'll it like I said it'll burn and it's not gonna be very different whatever in mold you can get cute molds they have very cute molds these are good for parties that good just for treats for you and your family these the ones that appear there probably when they're done they're about about five calories so you can eat them and not feel guilty and they will help your sweet tooth for those of you that have a sweet tooth they help with that they say that if you had chocolate chips or other things to them you know you just gotta kind of pay attention to how much they are in the calories do go up from there but the basic qualities with these basic ones like I said they're sugar-free and then they're like five calories a piece so I can indulge and not feel guilty and once you fill up all the mold you get it however to whatever thickness you want in each mould maybe you want a thinner candy or maybe not a thicker candy and while I was boiling it it only took a couple minutes but I only had a couple minutes do my video so cut it off but it only took a couple minutes and then once you get to that hard boil you let it do that hard boil for about a minute I boil it down to the loud sound [Music] then you'll put this in the freezer don't put it in the freezer I thought when you put it in the freezer it gives it a different texture and like taste okay but they better just put them in the refrigerator wait about two hours and then you just pop them out of your mold and you have little gummy candies and they're good treats for everyone enjoy", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "NH6Y4xBrKzc": "guardzilla bear welcomes to

subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you

bye", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's video CBD gummies for dummies' was able to help you when you are making your CBD purchase decisions to know the difference between the major categories within gummies isolates and fused coded full

sour worms and gummy bears with Lucas into white this is how you're going to need a little bit of lemon juice you're going to need a weekly stocking or any kind of chili pepper that you want and the turmoil and a bowl and a spoon so first I usually just put in a little bit of the lemon juice when I squeeze a bunch of the Chum wing and then I put looky there then I give it a little stir but more of the chili give it a little stir do it - it gets a little a little bit not too thick because when you after you're done adding your snack st. and you put you're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and this gets hard like not super hard to get Louise that's good ye up in the feedback my mom's messing up my video very she's leaving after the gummi bears are in you mix it in again and I want some worms I already have the lemon juice I think I got this at the Family Dollar for like a dollar I am I got this at HEB I got this one at on na Michoacana and I got all the candies at Walmart as 98 cents a bag or you to go to the Family Dollar and get the candies also but third daughter I really I'd rather get the 98 cents I make myself laughs our people oh so you mix and the worms you should have a little texture like this I'm gonna put some more of the Lucas a little more chewy mix it in there I throw in another bag will do the another one we're going to get crazy I'll see these were my kids York mr. cameraman Rene I'm going to eat one myself we're days continue stirring not be my crappy in my video all right hi everybody here just saved you a warm day hi everybody hi my son ready he's cute March annoying since I added more worms I wanted to be covered more Lucas mix it in there and we're done folks put it in the fridge or freezer for about 30 minutes and I'll come back and show you the result by this is a final product this is what your gummy worms chamoy worms should look like after being refrigerated see how it's kind of thick kind of sticky and I'm going to have my kids try it and see if they like it Marko's mmm-hmm they're good Peter you want to try one Peter does his own videos y'all want to follow Peter out of Peters movies how do they taste Peter this is oh thank you and that's it folks you want to make your kids happy by those gummy worms the dollar store and that's it bye", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "Uk0Y_r9PGPo": "oh [ __ ] i'm in

to let you guys know that my online chocolate shop is now carrying dark chocolate truffles with the most delicious whipped dark chocolate ganache filling they're so good oh my gosh they're only available for a limited time and we do ship internationally so if you would like a box definitely check out the link in the description box down below hello everybody welcome back so as you may see I have a little guest here today that enthusiam camera and so today we are making some gummy bears for dogs and this is part of my little Paddington's pantry series because this if you look at the camera is Paddington my Pomeranian and every so often at me makes and dog friendly treats so today we are making some coming ears and I didn't know that dogs could eat gelatin for the longest time and once I heard that that was possible I'm like oh my gosh this needs to happen for you too so we are making a lot of element gummy bears today but actually not bears they are a little like bone shape how cute is this mold I'll have them will link in the description box if you would like to check it out and before we get started I'll someone let you guys know that I have a member the only exclusive Facebook group that'll give you guys access or will allow you guys fix - um actually dictate what videos I film and give you guys a lot of creative control over this channel and over my chocolate shop on Etsy so if you wanna learn more about that I'll have that link in the description box below but without further ado let's get started and look at me bears and also in that group you'll get like behind-the-scenes photos and videos of Paddington's okay let's get started so first what you want to do is place two cups of fresh watermelon in a food processor and pulse until smooth show you to remove any pulp and then measure one cup of watermelon juice and so I'm using waggling in this video just because it's safe for dogs and it's like a nice kind of flavor for gummy bears that I recommend be using fresh fruit and it kind of this way versus using store-bought juice just because there's a lot of additives in store-bought juice like for humans and you don't necessarily know if there's an ingredient in there that could harm your dog there's a sweetener called xylitol off it on the screen here and that is so toxic three dogs so you definitely want to avoid anything with that and any kind of artificial sweetener so just to be safe I'd stick with fresh fruits or dogs safe beef broth beef broth I've purchased um beef broth powder from the pet store and it's safe for dogs there's no onion or garlic in it which is also toxic to dogs so before you decide to make experi dogs just do a quick Google and make sure that the ingredient that you're using like for the juice is animal friendly or dog friendly um one thing to really stay away from is any kind of juice that contains grapes or grape juice obviously those are so toxic for dogs oh my gosh so definitely stay away from that but I just recommend like call your vet or do a quick google before but watermelon is safe and paddington like I was sitting on the couch the other night and I was eating watermelon and he saw me and literally like dough onto me because he wanted it so badly so and you want to kill some gelatin into some water and microwave for 15 to 30 seconds or until it's liquid and it regards to the gelatin there's a lot of chatting in this video but you want to make sure that you that you're using a Knox gelatin which is plain unflavored unsweetened gelatin and don't use jell-o that like the job of box dip powder um that's because there are artificial sweeteners in that too and those aren't safe for your dog so just to be safe I'd recommend using thin box gelatin and I'll have that linked in the description box below and Amazon if you want to pick them up they want to pour the liquid gelatin into the watermelon juice and mix well or they make sure enjoyed gummy bear or Minnie bone mold and but into the fridge until it's set for about one to two hours let's unmold feed them to your puppy and are done that is so if it guys so much for watching these yummy should be stored in the fridge will probably last you around like four or five days just because gummies don't tend to like last as long as like the regular kind of like hard baked cookie and when they're at room temperature they soften up pretty quickly so I definitely recommend storing the fridge if you guys try these out please please please send us photos and take us at pink open e & pennington underscore calm on Instagram we would love to see what you make and always makes me so happy to see your creations and yeah please subscribe button entering the notification Bell so you notified on the upload because I

thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you tomorrow for another video", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I

serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "HEMxJl7_cEA": "[Music] welcome back to unwrapped i'm mark summers sorting through lots of halloween treats how about gummies they're a standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of the gummy bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you enjoyed this video what you think if you've had any problems or if you try it after watching this let me know how that worked out for you but I want to thank you very much for tuning in here today sorry for the cheese but if you haven't hit that subscribe button please do and we will make it worth your while join

snack to eat at the movies say it with me popcorn but gummy bears are close second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy this one i'd love to know what you guys will think what flavor gummy bears do you guys make let me know let me know down below your favorite candy and thank you so much for watching this video like this video if you like this recipe subscribe if you're new and i will see you all in the next video these are so good literally can't stop eating them these are so good guys i can't stop eating them they're delicious and it's just straight protein can't go wrong i", "yJzm2iPjmdE": "good morning and welcome to WTF where we transform food here at the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so modernist pantry com just search V ghen gelatin in the search bar at modernist pantry com that'll get you to find it from druids Grove it is a wonderful wonderful

edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "IUge6vES9wU": "hey guys a few weeks ago someone sent me some really fun popsicle molds and I was inspired to make homemade fudge levels I'm gonna share that recipe with you guys today I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen let's go through our ingredients you're gonna need chocolate chips a combination of whole milk and almond milk cornstarch cocoa powder vanilla coconut oil sugar and a pinch of salt this is a really easy recipe all you're gonna need is one saucepan put your chocolate chips in the pan add your milk sugar cornstarch cocoa powder and a pinch of salt turn your stove on to a medium low heat and whisk until your chocolate is melted you're gonna want to continue to whisk for about three minutes until the mixture thickens turn the heat off and add some vanilla and coconut oil then whisk to combine once your mixture is thickened all you need to do is pour it in your popsicle mold so I've got these really cool ones but you can use any kind of popsicle molds you have I like the fact that these stand up give it one more quick stir in pour it right in once your mixtures in there wipe all the evidence off of your lips that you had any tapes and put your popsicle sticks right in then put them in your freezer for at least four hours preferably overnight until they're ready to enjoy once your popsicles are frozen all you have to do is unroll them and I'm gonna be honest with you it is not the easiest task so if anyone has any tips for that leave them in the comments below but you unmold them you give them to your kids you have one for yourself they are a delicious snack and I hope you guys love them

Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting

going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "C_2S1nyMfQY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

for some healthy Easter treats for kids make sure you check out Julie's channel if you like this video make sure you hit the like button and subscribe to my channel that's first thing I want you guys to know about this recipe video is that it's extremely simple your kids can help and you're going to want them to help and it doesn't use crazy fancy ingredients you can kind of make it your own and try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for vitamin C so I'm just gonna put about a half a teaspoon in with a ziplock baggie and then shake it around it's super simple and it makes some really tasty and fun and sour likes like a healthy version of Sour Patch Kids so just you wanna shake that around zip it up give it a shake me shake you need help with the zipper what oh good job fine to 300 [Music] not really good mmm the orange one is so good why is that tastes like pink yours is candy that I used to eat some this is like bringing you back to my childhood what is that mmm wanna taste one of the kombucha no that's pretty good too let's do this sour grape also delicious and sour I hope that you guys really enjoyed today's video as always you can check the description box for link to all of the products that I use as well as the recipe is down there too make sure you head over to Julie's channel at a beautiful horizon and I hope you guys have a really great Easter bye bye i likey you", "n3_dV-e4d9c": "For this video, I\u2019m going to show you how\nto take a few simple ingredients, and make mountains and mountains of your own custom\ngummy candies, at home. Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

some Rockwood this the price tag it is was more attractive so it's actually pretty good I'm drink the gin gonna need some gelatin repackage whichever one rips the most is the one you take some sugar some food coloring and some measuring cups pots whatever main thing is some trays for your bears I want to give a shout out to mushiya I'm pretty cheap so she let me borrow them she got them from Amazon and she said she didn't do that great with them so I'm gonna see if I could degree with them okay so you take a cup of vodka make sure you wash your hands first smells great this out the way and pan hot whatever medium little heat it's gonna throw it back in hmm how were you gonna see that all right pull this out alright don't change my pot I hope I get him to click away I said it for Christmas girl don't we need that much this way so we don't put the sugar in it first I've got to bring over the wine okay forget that oh and the spatula a few moments later alright so the block is already sweetened so I'm not buying it that much it really doesn't need anything people can't handle vodka this is actually going to be my contribution for Thanksgiving so just just not crazy stir that in here until it dissolves I have the heat and medium low I didn't see that already you don't want to brown off the you don't want to bear it off the docket okay don't want to burn off the alcohol one packet series packet o3d packet three packets and you gonna stir you want to stir it before it becomes big I got it these nasty chunk you see this so I got this recipe from tipsy bartender they didn't mention how difficult it was working with this gelatin because soon as you put it in there it becomes a big chunk of gelatin I think one recipe online said to let it cool I'm gonna add some food coloring I'm not doing that I let it cool within the whole bottom of the job to make sure got really thick at the bottom those extraordinary doesn't match whatever chunks you see to mash it vodka probably should have been hotter but I'm not taking the chance like I'm taking the chance chumps ain't going away it's a good thing the bottom of this pot is scraped off a little bit because I could see the chunks better in those areas see that sweat chunk that you can't see them over there though use an old pack when you're making this JV tip they look good it does a little steam alright I'm not burning anymore this [ __ ] alright ah [ __ ] that all right back to my spot all right go ahead should I wait till it cools down just a little bit just a little bit I let it cool down all right time to open a row we have all right so since it's pineapple okay yeah okay so that tastes like yellow and a little bit of red all right all right all right I'm going to show you how many drops I use I'm not pulling out the phone again why does the yellow look red on we're gonna do one right now dan it looks like pineapple mmm kind of satisfied with that kind of satisfied with the one truck the yellow just one more yeah turns out right that's it yeah you know what no red no red okay that's crazy all right stir stir stir mike tipsy bartender says we're just gonna sit this on a cellphone alright don't need that go back to the backup all right so I'm gonna use this as a poor okay look at that nice pissy over my family's gonna love this get it all in there yeah that's good all right it's a lot easier when you have a pan because this moves you pick it up and look what happens see that all your [ __ ] is spilling all over the place so get a pan didn't put that on it so right get this out the way and we're just gonna pour be very gentle like learn your pores with some water or something okay beautiful don't have to fill it all the way to the top like I'm doing I don't take it easy [Music] as you can see my turkey is done look at that look at that look at that sit apiece hmm well let's get back to what matters all right it's probably been about an hour you don't have to wait two or three hours that ridiculous ol put these in right we're gonna take the thickest one out see if it's ready actually all right this one's the thickest one it's not presentable so I'm just gonna eat it all right it's ready I'm gonna show you the best one look at that there you ever see oh that's how you do it look at that my hands are washed I'm not gonna eat anymore I'm just gonna put

donald it's so loud for some reason sorry about the um talking background this is my parents the next one of these the end green one i'm going to do a different way every single one of these i'm going to do a different method of rounding that you know i don't know why i have so many ways of eating them oh i only could default because only like them cause they only had some more but okay this one i'm gonna do have to make it [Music] okay there it is it's like oh a flying saucer a tanky i'm just gonna keep twisting it so it's a little bit like less stronger than it like if you know what i mean so you can like stretch it look stretch twirl we're gonna do we're gonna put it on finger the index finger whoa i don't know if that looks you can see that this is like isn't it that's sick oh yeah

what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "JDbazWjashQ": "[Music] but mr. gummy princess toy review hybrids and princesses it's a team I bet the president's missus fans today we are back with another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of today's video maybe like more signs experiments give you a big thumbs up and subscribe bye remember this is fine", "z87xwoms6Os": "why are you all here no fingers don't eat me [Music] in today's video we're revisiting one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun

the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions

them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy

description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone

today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "jvhAXh5pFFo": "what's up guys it's Audra and back today with another tutorial on a sweet treat that you can make at home so I don't know if you guys have seen that the news lately probably not hard-hitting news there's a lot of rose' trends going on with drinks and food and different things that you can eat but there are friggin rosey gummy bears and there was an 18,000 person waiting list for these things so today I decided to do a gummy tutorial on how to make your own wine gummy bears but I'll do you one even better I put glitter in them so yes they do make edible glitter it's called disco dust and basically it's just an edible sugar that's turned into glitter which you can put on cakes or practically anything it doesn't have any kind of a flavor or anything but it's so pretty it makes everything shiny which is awesome so I decided to buy some and I'm gonna put links to everything that I used in today's video down below in the description so you can buy them yourself but I'm a better Kunis gummy bears well I get these they're glittery and you can eat them and they taste like wine I mean how much better can it get then wine and glitter gummy bears so here's like the close-up shot if it'll focus close up but these guys how get out oMG they're super glittery they're so cute and they actually do taste like the wine that I use so I decided to use a Moscato wine since it's one of the most sweet wines that you can get that's a white wine so I went with a white wine so that you're able to see the glitter rather than using a red wine and so I chose this one in particular it's really good it's really sweet so using that there's enough sweetness plus adding a little bit of sugar to the mix so these don't actually turn out like traditional gummy bears they're not quite as chewy they have more of like a jello texture they're still really good and they have a gummy consistency like I said great for parties great for gifts or just impressing your friends so let's go ahead and get started thanks for watching today guys and I hope you enjoyed the video if you did be sure to give me a thumbs up and let me know in the comments so I can keep making more videos like this for you again all the products that I used in today's video are down in the description below so that you can buy them yourselves and I really hope that you enjoyed making glitter wine gummies today and I'll see you next time bye", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "HixZD18L0lA": "what's up everybody your favorite might be vPro sexy matcha with some more roll of weightlifting and buttery and all the fun stuff we do we're doing a Q&A a lot of questions that we get asked on a regular basis we get a [ __ ] ton of messages emails direct messages comments everything thank you for everything the response we've gotten from everything we do from all-american roughneck to accents like supplements everything we everything that we've been doing has you know caught great great traction and what you guys do to support us is phenomenal you know whenever I first started this with Bob you know three years ago I thought this would be possible but the watching the positivity occur is what is just [ __ ] awesome the way you guys are changing your lives the the just how hard you've worked to make your life more positive so that the people in your lives the people that actually [ __ ] matter and your immediate life benefit you know because Instagram is great the motivation there is a lot of [ __ ] fake [ __ ] out there and seeing how you guys have responded and watching you and and I'm hoping that you continue to keep high moral value your morals on a high level for your yourself your family your friends everybody that is in your immediate life that actually [ __ ] matters and not everybody it's on here that's the good [ __ ] seeing you change your lives for the benefit of yourself and everybody in your life that's the good [ __ ] I love it but we'll get into this like I said we get a ton of messages I don't answer them all personally thank you for everything but we're gonna go over some of the most common questions that we get excuse me eating a lot of food these days so snacks all right first one gummy bears why do I eat the gummy bears just like them there is no physiological benefit that I am trying to attain from eating the gummy bears like I'm not like hot I can't wait for that [ __ ] Moonie 5 gummy bears and get like an insulin spike no gummy bears are not good for you there if you eat too many of them [ __ ] your [ __ ] up in there you'll be [ __ ] for days and all this and people were talking about it and I don't eat that many gummy bears ain't like a handful of them go get like a handful like eight put like five in my pre-workout like eat three that's it I eat my gummy bears around pre-workout time I love it they make me smile they make me feel good about myself they doing my favorite candy since I was a kid my mom you know whenever like Christmas and Easter and all that [ __ ] gummi bears whenever candy stores like still exist you don't see them too often now at least around here like you be would go into the gummy bears store they'd have like the [ __ ] the wall of like things you flip up and pull out and put in the bag and all that [ __ ] yeah I haven't seen those in a while but always got a ton of gummies it's my [ __ ] and to this day you know being a pro bar being a bodybuilder in general you deprive themselves of the things you like gummy bears whenever I died it was one thing I didn't need a lot of does it's not good for you also making my coffee away like no sugar no creamer just black [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks but those are the things you take out of your life so that you can look good naked so now that I'm not doing that season setting getting jacked and tan looking that's much tan I need the gummi bears no physiological benefit zero none don't care what it does just like to eat them if you're looking for insulin spike or some type of benefit from a carbohydrate you can drink [ __ ] Gatorade you can get a rapid glycogen loader car power drink your pre-workout I take those drink the Gatorade might mix it with [ __ ] Gatorade and it's still the gummy bears in why because like the taste they make me feel good so that's it also the deadlifts and gummy bears sure so that shirt big sellin shirt for us we love it that came from time whenever the deadlifts and gummy bears thing whenever I was going through a pretty rough time in my life whenever I was going through the divorce with my ex and me you know having full custody of kids and being super dad and having to do all this stuff it was really rough it sucked and had a lot of crazy emotions [ __ ] with my head and I thought you know I needed to I needed to go to a place that would like let all my aggression out let all my [ __ ] anxiety let all my let all my emotions pour out and I was like I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna eat gummy bears train back the deadlifts and pull-ups and all the hardship sweat my [ __ ] balls off and left listen him out so that's what I did that's where that shirt came from that shirt that is just such a wild success and everybody loves it because if they go eat gummy bears and do deadlifts and listen to metal and do hard [ __ ] and make you sweat bro that's good [ __ ] makes bill glad that came from a really shitty time so you know how if you hear those things that like good can come from really bad places and really bad situations that it did and that was where it came from I was able to go to the gym just eat handful gummy bears do set it deadlifts we put up and put on more weight and for gummy bears do deadlifts that's my [ __ ] loved it so that's where it came from the gummy bears do not eat gummy bears thinking you're going to like get some great grand [ __ ] effect from them they don't hold a whole lot of good nutritional value they don't anything they're pure [ __ ] sugar their [ __ ] will [ __ ] your teeth up after belly up I don't care I like on ah so I hope we can close the case on that situation I mean I think I think [ __ ] flex magazine was like oh like after I started saying this [ __ ] they were like oh like you can eat gummy bears and like post-workout and it's like good cuz it's sugar and this now it's like Jesus Christ no it doesn't know how it works like there's way better things you could be [ __ ] eating post-workout then shitty gummy bears okay maybe drink water I might be a good starter not [ __ ] gummy bears is that it been [ __ ] or better than she [ __ ] protein bars dick after selling oh man gummy bears I just like them Oh what else snacks that's another question snacks what do I personally like because I always talk about snacks [ __ ] love them and what are also good bodybuilder snacks too that you can have in your program that can help add weight and do good for you so start number one me personally I love salty snacks [ __ ] extra salty pretzels Doritos cheez-its get snacks that's my [ __ ] I don't the gummy bear thing the sweet thing that's only pre-workout I just like those but from like the snackin standpoint like it high would've baked and sitting there got a couple beers in me yep yep extra salty pretzels they're in there there's Doritos in there I like nacho cheese the kids like Cool Ranch that's good cheese it's in there too so moving on to snacks that benefit protein that benefit you as a bodybuilder [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly rice cakes those are my go-to I usually have two or three of them before I hit the gym right now my calories are up I eat the Smuckers all-natural creamy I like crunchy but I go through I go through about 16 ounce through our peanut butter in about three days yeah maybe sooner depends on what I'm training calories are crazy high right now I've never eaten this much fat I am right now it's working out well I like it I feel better I think more clear I think more clearly or clearer however you want to term that but yeah peanut butter and jelly rice cakes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the sandwiches in the middle of the night I'll have like I'll have a cup of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I had big training day I usually do like a large cup of almond milk or I'll mix up a protein shake like one scoop of protein with 8 to 12 ounces of almond milk with my - peanut butter jelly sandwiches yeah snack wise I also so in the truck I also will have trail mix but something so if I'm behind on a meal and I need to keep my calories high or in between meals mean - you know peanuts almonds dried fruit I love that [ __ ] peanut butter bean butter pretzels they're not really greatest for you it's like that's not salty fat guy thing that if you notice there's a lot of peanuts and peanut butter involved with my with my snacking fruit I eat a banana or two a day apples if we got them yeah I do a good bit of fruit too right now my meals are quite large you know a meeting about 40 to 50 grams of protein along with 70 to 100 grams of carbohydrates at each meal five solid meals a day so the snacking is limited and it's like I said it's usually higher calorie snacking as well so that's also why look at the my training sessions need to be [ __ ] intense they need to be optimized they need to be really [ __ ] hard so I sweat I burn those calories I need to eat that type of food if you are not training like that you will get fat from eating all of that [ __ ] for [ __ ] sure other good snacking for dieting that's another question people go out to snack and while dieting the fruit has sugar in it even though it's unprocessed processed on processed sugar natural sugars I it depends on how far you are into a prep some people don't like it I'm still fine with some fruit here and there probably up until like six eight weeks out maybe seven weeks somewhere on there cut it out other people have their own decisions about that I'm talking about everyday snacking uh cucumbers celery greens those are good snack and thins while you're dieting problem is with those is whenever you start adding [ __ ] to it like peanut butter dressings things like that I usually stick to like if I need to I'll add a little bit of salt to it nice and tasty tastes like salt with water and like crunch that's pretty much what it is about peanut butter jelly sandwich but no those those are pretty much my daily snacks that's it yeah I like salty pretzels ice cream unlike that [ __ ] with my belly and lactose-intolerant so I got to be careful with that yep pretty much it locked peanut butter my jelly I think when I go to the store I typically buy like four or five jars at a time but hey what's do yeah no I don't think yo Girt back to us yogurt would be a good snack for people candy you can eat candy too little [ __ ] your [ __ ] all up being sarcastic don't do that late night snacks cereal I do that raisin bran with fruity pebbles in there protein shake is the milk fuckin'-a right that's my [ __ ] take a nice dump in the morning from it all right moving on how much protein should I eat per day oh boy along with this people also get a lot of digestion I get a lot of digestive questions how much protein should be today what depends on how much lean body mass you have right the next thing is is what are you training like how are you training what what are you doing what what physical exertion are you putting out what are you putting out that you need food for how are you training like I said me when I'm going in to Train I'm training like a [ __ ] animal I am going nuts I'm going to put myself through the [ __ ] hardest workout I possibly can for that day and I'm not gonna settle for anything less I'm going to push myself so that I'm gonna push myself further than I thought I could go before whenever I started when I started I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] work today as I'm doing it I'm searching for ways for that workout to get harder I want to find it so it can be harder so I can challenge myself then I need to eat because the [ __ ] that I just did to challenge myself I was [ __ ] pouring sweat I was shaking I was pushing myself way past what my body actually wanted to do so therefore now I need to refuel my body so that it can grow so that it can rebuild it so that it can recover how much protein do I need to do that see some people be like oh you need 1.5 grams of protein per lean body mass so if you're - if you have 200 pounds of lean body mass you need 300 grams of protein it's a good way to gauge it but if you are working if you are doing the workouts that I've been doing that I do [ __ ] 300 grams ain't enough will it work yes will it suffice yes but in order to grow need more in my opinion you also need a fuckload of carbohydrates because actually meeting right now you're also getting a good bit fast I probably take in per day in protein I probably take in like 350 grams of protein per day that's you know I'm eight weeks in almost nine and a half weeks into my into a program so I'm in the thick of it I got seven and a half weeks left of this program so I'm in the middle of it and I'm [ __ ] working hard my body is burning so therefore that 350 grams of protein probably around for 425 on like cheat days were very very high calorie days my body can utilize all of those and I know that through a couple things one being my digestion I'm not when I'm not pushing out as much gas I'm not gasps I'm not bloated with gas and I'm my elimination schedule is now the same every day so now I am utilizing all of the food that I'm eating okay one thing in the beginning of a program when people start out and they just started training either like in week 1 2 3 and they're eating this food and they are just [ __ ] farting like a fiend they're farting all [ __ ] day long and it smells like [ __ ] bro you are your body it is overload for your body you're [ __ ] it out you're not absorbing it all and you are just gaseous [ __ ] your body doesn't like what's going on so that's why in the beginning you have to start with a little bit lower like I was eatin in the beginning I was even like 275 grams of protein and I was still with my body was becoming acclimated to us part and I was my shed schedule was out of control was also eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats but the protein standpoint with one and a half grams of protein per per pound of lean body mass is a great place to start if you are feeling uncomfortable because that's too much then it's too much you need to back down a little bit maybe 1 1 in a quarter of grams or put two five grams then as you progress into your program you can increase it so the protein thing like I said that's a great place to start that's that's a well-known fact but just also take into consideration all of the other food that you're eating as well my macros for the day broccoli protein 350 grams of protein like I said over for on my on my cheat days with my high calorie days carbohydrates 550 to 750 average per day than on my high calorie days thousand more possibly fats you know probably safe fats roughly yeah 100 to 150 a day pretty pretty pretty religiously every day and I attest that type of eating to the way I'm trained I haven't trained this hard like I happen since years ago years ago and Mikan a lot of 236 pounds when I wake up I'm like 239 when I go to bed and then just keep on training so from a protein standpoint that digestion part pay attention to your digestion digestion absorption elimination if your elimination process is going wrong or your fart a lot and [ __ ] spraying the toilet when you're taking a dump or you're not being absorbed it's just a mess your fart a lot crazy gassy body's having a hard time digesting digesting all of that so back off the protein a little bit like your body become acclimated and as you continue to train harder and harder and the body becomes acclimated and you start working into it all start increasing your food that's how you grow that's how your body has a smooth transition into your your progress your goals it's my opinion [ __ ] do I know next ah here's a good one this is it should I take steroids yes no should I smoke meth sure no that would not be a good idea should I smoke cigarettes if you want to a really good idea that question is a personal [ __ ] choice it's up to you should you do it my opinion no there's pot calling the kettle black however that's saying goes no III don't you though you better have a purpose but I have a purpose you better have researched it and you better have an understanding of what's going to occur if you're asking me should you take steroids what do you know about them have you done research are you educated do you know what the side effects are do you know what can occur do you know if the answer is no then my answer is [ __ ] no if your answer is yes and you can explain to me all those things I just asked all right then now it's personal choice it's up to you you're you're educated you know things are gonna go wrong you know the consequences that you're gonna have to live with possibly for the rest of your life it's all up to you that means that you can't come crying like a little [ __ ] victim that this happened to me because I did this well [ __ ] yeah did would you expect your stupid [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] saying a [ __ ] joke you know these I hear [ __ ] crazy stories from people with the Jemez crazy stories people [ __ ] taking a thousand digs at rent a week that's it thousand makes a trend a week no tests no nothing just the trend are you a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep you are and then after they're done they want to say uh it didn't work out for me I had all these problems no [ __ ] [ __ ] you had problems like most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that what their supplements are supposed to do and then they're also taking a bunch of gear and wondering why the dick doesn't get hard after they stop taking [ __ ] or I don't understand the whole process of testicular atrophy or anything like that holy [ __ ] don't be that goddamn stupid some people are and if you are one of those people I'm gonna highly recommend you change your ways so my next recommendation would be to go watch two steroids drugs and light videos that we put out we put out I think you tell you well five of them thus far the first ones where you should start part one it's really good but overall like I said in those videos it's all personal choice don't do dumb [ __ ] that's like my [ __ ] blanket statement for everything I've done dumb [ __ ] I'll probably continue to do some dumb [ __ ] here and there but make sure that that type of such that type of thing right there should I take steroids take that seriously do your research don't think that you can take steroids for six weeks and everything will be okay and then you'll stop and everything will be okay no [ __ ] these are hormones that you are injecting or putting into your body they are going to affect you everything in this [ __ ] because if I can take something that makes me bigger faster and stronger if I eat train hydrate work harder leave wadd some crazy [ __ ] take it serious don't be a [ __ ] don't be dumb I mean how am i able to sit here and say all this [ __ ] because I did do a lot of dumb [ __ ] he did that's how I learned I'm stubborn bullheaded I'm a risk taker I'll continue to be that and everything that I do in life because that's my personality but I'm recognizing that it's myself and that's how I operate I also am taking full accountability for my decisions in my actions you don't hear me crying nobody so whenever you do these things you're not allowed to cry like a little [ __ ] victim well this happened to me I can't believe I don't want it yeah dude what the [ __ ] do you expect of course that's what's gonna happen [ __ ] off job I hope this was fun I have fun gummy bears snacks protein juice it's all good love it all [ __ ] up but stay tuned for more each of Wiis don't take too much Hannah draw and stick the old lady just like she likes it even some way she doesn't like it she'll like it you", "8G9HLsYdeVw": "hello everybody welcome back welcome back to cook miss so today we are making some cranberry gummy bears so I'm sure you guys know that I've made a bunch of different gummy bear recipes in the past and I thought I'd kind of make them into like a holiday flavor these days super refreshing and they're so pretty and I think it'd be really cute touch to any Christmas party because there's still holiday themed but they're like a traditional candy they're super easy to make you can make these out of whim super super simple so let's get started so first one is sprinkle the gelatin into the water and let it develop for five minutes pour the cranberry juice into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until it's fully dissolved then pour the liquid into a container with an easy pour spout and pour into a gummy bear mold and if you find that the color isn't as bright you add a couple drops of red food coloring just to boost up the color a little bit then place the holed in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully sat for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or you can pop a couple into some champagne glasses and top with champagne for a cute festive touch to your cocktail and you are done so I thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe if you guys follow me on snapchat you know there is another like festive gummy bear recipe coming up soon so make sure to stay tuned for that and I will see you tomorrow for an all new recipe [Music]", "Ni8pQ4XnUfs": "[Music] so [Music] you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

here open up my plate excuse it in there and I'm gonna get this in the center of these plates I can't do it one-handed so it will be very bad start off a little bit of pressure oh sure Jews I don't expect no big downpour like I said this is 6 grams so I'll probably get about one point three grams of return from it somewhere around there 1.2 1.3 man definitely looking good a little more pressure now be careful though because you had too much pressure you will bust the bag or the parchment paper this is really strong parchment paper it's not from the grocery store this is from peer pressure also but you can still only take so much before you rip it wide open alright guys so we're at about the 2 minute mark [Applause] [Applause] so there we have it looking good peace", "KU64fZTL2eo": "first of all I want to say I have never done Matt I know my my spelt I feel like I should clarify I am dropped with Alvarado Claire I don't use to have a huge meth problem right I've never done that I've also never skied before which you know is a bit of Carlos in in Colorado you know it's like they say a Colorado family that's happy not skiing is like a Catholic family that's happy [Applause] I can but in erskine I've never done meth before I thought about it never done it and here's why like I said Colorado used a huge meth problem but that is until the Colorado antiemetic project okay which was a seriously psays commercial was billboards which drove many shoots down in Colorado like 90% this is true with the tried and true method of scaring the [ __ ] out of teens mostly right and there were there were a lot of like versions of it but my favorite was there was a billboard right next to my high school which was a picture of just like the gross grungy sink splat covered in blood okay and it said at the top you never think you try to peel off your own skin [Music] meth will change that first of all very effective right like I will never do that as a result of that I'm hoping that you will ever do that as a result of that and maybe some use it's too late I'm saying you look like you can hide but I'm saying you look like you could be possibly the biggest myself too though you know I mean to wear skinny popular but you never see me try to feel our own skin meth will change that what I would love to see would be like a similar style of PSA but for like way less dangerous drugs you know like you never think you try to peel break with your teeth and then use the peel grape sort of like lick bomb on your lips because it looks stupid or chapped we will change that with a stranger about these girls Palestinian conflict in Wendy's for drinks will change that or like or like even everything you try to sort and categorize the entire party size back of flamin hot she goes by size and shape at all [Music] and sing with me that tapes mostly great [Music] deformation it drives clear not from my demeanor I had two teachers when I was at youth who tried to get my parents to put me on adderall to like tell me picture what I was like as I could like picture like Sid from Toy Story meets Chicken Little like do but in a hurry and I have those glasses right but not just the glasses I had glasses with like that strength action strapped right back here right because I was lived a very active lifestyle okay I was doing this a lot apparently with my head and there also they were flexible glasses rent like literally the wires in the classes would bend right because my parents didn't trust me and so there was and there was another girl in my class in the first grade her name was Rachel Wilson and she also had glasses and one day I was just playing with my glasses just bending them as one doesn't want to do and she was I kind of like how do you do that I was like I'm just do it she was like oh snap I went to the principal's office I'm kidding I'm kidding she's rich it was yeah I don't know my heaven on man I am done much cocaine and I've like weed though I've never gotten like crazy with it when an exception which is that when I was back home in Denver over this last Christmas I was hanging on my friend sacks basement he told me Oh Sam by the way that is 50 milligrams for those of you who don't regularly eat marijuana gummies think about like this like in terms of alcohol like eating a 50 milligram gummy is like if instead of doing like a couple shots of alcohol to like kick off your night if instead you just like slam your head in a minivan doing are doing around like it's inscrutable passage maybe the gummy puts on the movie 24 days later and passes out 20 dessert that's life if a zombie movie was written by someone who had just taken a 50 milligrams gummy okay so I'm losing my mind zombies are getting hacked up with machetes that one skinny dudes hooking people's eyes down zombies are eating people's necks and then the climax of the movie this dude who's like chained to a military base and it's grimy zombies it's like it's just people killing people and I look over at my past our friend Zach and I'm like he's of people right settle down when it comes to peace for this girlfriend I'm standing there [Music] because we make eye contact right she like pushes some water thank you and we make contact and I'm like I know that I'm flying other higher than I've ever been but I like I feel like I get closer to earth and we just like we don't we don't say anything but we just like and I'm like I'm so conflicted cuz I'm like I'm in love but I don't know how to tell my friend my friend Zach doesn't have a girlfriend he does have a two-and-a-half-year-old a border collie named Daisy whom I spooned for anywhere from 15 minutes to seven and a half hours [Music] run away so that you can escape society and the shackles of expectations put upon you we will change that [Applause]", "QqGWuQXJbcI": "hello [Music] um uh [Music] um [Music]", "E3aJKfETuaQ": "who wants to talk CBD this guy does and let me tell you what today I've got the fun stuff the CBD gummy bears oh yeah [Music] what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do um with these I'm not gonna lie there's a whole lot of things that you can say and you can't say about CBD because obviously like we covered the FDA hasn't approved of anything but let me tell you what they do for me what they do for me I'll leave these at night right before bed like a half hour hour before bed somewhere around there I'm out like a light I sleep I mean I'm out I used to be the guy who tossed and turn to go to bed sit there flip through my phone for you know an hour or two no I go right to bed I also have a day job believe it or not

that's personal experience that's just me telling you again the FDA didn't doesn't say that's what it will do what it won't - etc etc I'm just telling you from personal experience so again check the description below you're gonna find a link delivered directly to the product get yourself something all right trust me get yourself something just try it do yourself a favor and just try so until next

Stacey", "9-4ZUurL9ZI": "today your beautiful day is good clearly tell I need one to learn about math but I'm stupid I don't know what I'm doing how do i do most ah how do I do multiplication I don't know what I do I want it hopefully learn today after strawberry teaches me shy married oh there you are hi there so why are you sorry what are you going to do today well I'm going to teach you what's potations you don't know how Thank You strawberry that's nice of you so just to teach you multiplication starts every four times Inc with the X it always starts every time you have two times it sorry that that would not the best description but what I mean is every time you multiply you have to count that number that much time so say example one times one one account one one time what do I get one good job blueberry you know something okay and I hardly wants five times five count five five times how much time do you get 5 10 15 20 25 the age of 25 Oh multiplication said simpler than I thought how else do I do it well since I don't have paper there's a harder way but it goes by faster say I have a problem called with double juice called 12 times 5 wow that's a big number I don't know what to do so say you had paper write down 12 on the paper times 5 you count what's 5 times 2 you can't to 5 times 2 4 6 8 10 there we go 10 so we wear a zebra on the paper and add the 1 so then 5 times 1 is 5 put her to F extra 5 which will make that six so what is that 6 Steve I was just excited 60s the answer yep that's correct and multiplications simpler than you think just you really have to think through it yes Natsuki so much easy now Thank You strawberry you're welcome and that's gonna do it for today's video if you guys did enjoy this will learning gummy bear video make sure to leave a like

right he's not looking that one hit me really hard oh my gosh my stomach really hurts yes right that's worth it this is all i've eaten today three minutes ryan oh my that's a lot of time left still tap out you don't have to max out that's true i don't want you to get sick this is really no different than what ryan eats every day that's true how much time do i have you have a minute a minute if he throws up it's over i just really had to fart and i ran out of the room is that what that was you crop dusted me i'm sorry nine eight seven six [Music] all right ryan you had a stack of cash you ready to see how much you're in hopefully it's enough here we go all right 85 90 95 100. 100 510 115 okay 120. 125. would you pay that money right now to not feel the way you do yes how much are you gonna eat well we'll see probably not this much can we go next uh yeah you guys are good to go spin the wheel and let's see what time you get so we're gonna be on the same team so we get to spin the wheel twice and then you guys are teaming up with that you're gonna combine the gummies you eat and combine the scores oh five points oh that was five minutes all right fine five minutes spin it again and we're gonna combine time combine gummies and combine money but the money that gets paid out has to be split between the boat carter it says 15 minutes we can't read because you cheated i know it's going to happen your turn okay so five minutes plus five give me five all right so since you guys are teaming up i'm gonna say that's fair but just know that everything eaten combined between the both of you is gonna get paid out and then split between the both of you all right here we go in three two one go oh my god that is tough if you can finish that in 20 minutes that's 250 dollars and that's a hundred dollars for your cheeseburger stuff has been the banker of the day 100 bucks there's a hundred dollars right here i feel like the bigger the gummies get like the more like like just like just so [Applause] [Music] hang on is it only liz cheating or denise too that's not wine liz that's literally yours it looks like it's your burger look at this i don't think that this is a valid attempt take one bite throw the rest of it in the trash can oh man upon further inspection there's actually nothing in here from denise this is only the burger so denise is still going so whatever denise eats and finishes she'll get paid so she's working on a 250 bottle of coca-cola gummy denise you got this oh no way she's actually doing it are you seeing this okay what none that she has yo eric how much time we got all right denise five and a half minutes left she's almost about to finish that coca-cola bottle which is 250 dollars right here that's 250. wait carter come on two minutes left and denise is actually doing some serious work on this can i talk back in and just try to eat the pizza in two minutes let's help her okay fine two minutes ago can you could fold it because you're not going to finish that there's not much time left doesn't matter if you fold it like new york or not a minute left a minute left a minute denise you gotta put work okay all right come on oh she's got in her mouth look at these trying to finish how does it you're probably all sugared up all right five four three two one all right liz if you can somehow finish that then you're set if you can finish that whatever's in your mouth you are set for a 250 bottle of gummy soda that's insane if you drop any piece it's over just like bailey it's over she dropped the piece you drop oh all right so liz you won a whopping zero dollars because you cheated but denise on the other hand really impressive because you ate an entire one of these and this is a 250 dollar bottle of cola gummy so banker stove let's pay it out 250 dollars make it rain make it rain ready have to divide it into two wait that's true hey that's true that's what we said beginning it is split by two oh carter that puts us in first place and everyone else is a loser well i would say everyone is a winner if they walk away with even one dollar our next contestant is a big eater and he is also the winner of our last eating challenge who can gain the most weight in 45 minutes erica you gained 10 pounds of food in 45 minutes so i think you have a pretty good shot at eating a lot of pounds of gummy all right eric let's spin it and see how much time you get there you go the time will be in your favor for this one since the max is only 15 minutes oh 10 minutes okay all right i feel like you could eat at least one of those five pound gummy bears whoa hi jojo ready starting in three two one go all right and he's off oh wow going to be paying out some cash on this kid i might be losing this whole stack right here oh he just ate the gummy bear's face oh that is a strong gummy bear guys it is the world's biggest oh my god there's no way oh oh my okay guys eric is a beast he can eat some serious food and i think he might even go for the green one next whoa wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where are you wait where's he going what he literally has seven minutes you're giving up oh my god i'm disgusting this is not for me this challenge is disgusting i don't know how you came up with this all right eric you still have six minutes so you could start again on a new gummy bear if you want since you spit that one out or what are you doing this challenge is not worth it after seeing ryan out there on the couch i just don't even think it's gonna be worth the money i'm calling it man i'm calling it that's it all right guys i can't believe it but eric is actually tapping out he's forgoing the thousand dollar gummy bear wait hang on what'd you just eat wait he gets one dollar stone he gets one dollar oh you're still on top two dollars four five six seven dollars all right so i'm calling it wow i'm taking a wrong cash right there all right everyone's a winner so six sixty dollars pathetic you know what i can't i walked away with something and i'm not disgustingly sick so i'll take it as a win here we go guys this is the grand finale we are doing jojo versus stove the way this one is gonna work is they're going to both go at the same time and the person who eats the most is going to steal the other person's winnings and walk away with everything so it's high risk high reward winner takes all you guys ready to spend ready i'll let you go oh five minutes okay so how about he rolled five so multiply that by two so ten minutes give us ten minutes all right you know what all right all right deal here we go ten minutes on timer in three two one start oh he's going for the hot dog hot dog it's a hundred bucks if you can finish it 250 dollars if you can jojo eat like half of that jojo that's a hundred dollar hot dog yeah at this rate he's gonna eat four of those before subjects are ones i mean he might crush the plate of them oh oh he's got it where's the honey hundred bucks for jojo 100 he has to finish it he's gotta finish it but it's right here for you jojo will be officially in first place for this final round and uh remember guys whoever eats the most in this round steals the other person's eatings and earnings so winner takes all no slow mo slow we sell a lot of time left i don't know you just swallowed it the boy has got too much on his plate he's gonna he's gonna make it work i guess technically you could spit it out as long as you still eat it what's wrong with you eyes on the fries i think after this video we're never doing an eating challenge ever again five minutes left eyes on the prize i need some yeezys that's as big as the money you're so close i don't want to throw up after you take your time i mean look you got three and a half years so you can do the mail trip at the end yeah jojo's really clean it up jojo is done that's a hundred bucks ryan payman right here juice that's fine i'll give it to him yeah you get through after think about that jojo you realize if he finishes i know you lose because that's 250. i don't think he is dude that crust is crazy this is so much this that's a long a minute and ten two more dollars just 103. 25 seconds stove just has to get it in his mouth for it to count and then he ultimately has to finish eating it at some point later after the timer am i 110 i haven't seen anyone do that successfully so i think it's a lot harder than it sounds like three four one two three four five six seven eight elbows count you walk away with 250 plus jojo's 100 and change this is really exciting guys this is a very exciting fun round place your bets right now who is going to win we're going to check back in here on stove and see if you can finish you can't go this far just to lose though i mean jojo wants to do it he's actually put in some serious work though oh wait there's one there's a loose piece no i don't know so seriously if that somehow slips and falls it's game over yeah oh oh no oh no what yeah guys no carter there's no way that counts you know he said you said if it touches the ground he loses he said he can't use your hands no hands no hands ugh done all right all right hang on hang on here is the final ruling so the timer ended his stove did not finish his pizza but he did not use his hands and he was able to get it done because he had it all in his mouth and then the timer but he then dropped one little piece which then he ate without using his hands so does that count as a disqualification i'm not sure because also jojo has at least a little tiny piece of equal size of equal size so it's snowdrop so i would say that maybe stone what might end up being the winner but i feel like maybe we should leave it to you guys to vote in the comments down below who should walk away or should jojo keep his winnings and should still keep his winnings i think both of them worked really hard yeah i think they both deserve what they oh yeah i think they're gonna leave jojo and stove because that was a tough round hey guys the bank saw you did a really good job hey hang on hey that's my cash yeah what are you doing guys the bank thought you did great hey here we go ryan give me my money back anyways guys comment down below what you guys would eat and how many of these gummy bears would eat i'll see you guys on the next vlog [Music] piece [Music] you", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "W3iwBHi8Uz0": "hey guys welcome to fit monsters today we're doing drunken gummy bears I got an email from Corey out in Oklahoma City who wants us to try making drunken gummy bears yep exactly what sounds like they're drunk gummy bears we're using Skyy Vodka and Haribo gummy bears today let's see if it works so the first step is to dump out your gummy bears using a plastic container something that's going to hold all the gummy bears some people have just had a tub of Ganga that they bought from the store see you have your tub of gummy bears I got away and now we're going to add the vodka they suggest having the vodka level with the gummy bears so about a cup and a half we've measured Oh now you're supposed to soak this for five days in the fridge every day you're supposed to mix it so they don't stick all together so now we're supposed to let the soap for five days then after five days you're supposed to add the fruit punch concentrate actually I chose fruit punch but you can choose any kind of juice she's like it's supposed to make the taste of the gummy bears not be so vodka like we'll see if it works we're supposed to soak it in the punch for about two days so I'll see you guys the seven days and see if it worked well it's been a long seven days waiting for these babies to get ready so we're going to dump them in the strainer and see if they're ready to party whoa these are yeah like twice the size they were originally as you can see the gummy bear is now twice besides pushy especially like jello does taste like Rocco it tastes like a jello shot does exactly what tastes like it did work so pin trusted as a pinterest for us alright some of you guys have pins at home you'd like is to try email us at bus at investors tv.com or leave a comment below and don't forget to subscribe be a long long night", "Woyk82ct4xE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love to see what you guys are interested in buying so I will see you all again next time bye you", "s1271Tn7Blc": "[Music] that's right you see what's up the booze is out and there's some candy here so what's the EJ gonna do he's gonna make some drunken ass gummy bears today that's right you know if I'm making some candy or a tree for a party you know what's got boobs involved in it that's right that's how we roll around here at DJ's brew to making the alcoholic fun well yeah anyways so we're gonna make some drunken gummy bears today or also I guess you could call them vodka infused gummy bears how are we gonna do this well we're gonna buy some gummy bears first here we've got a bag of gummy bears we've opened what type of gummy bears do you want to get you can't want to get ones that are clear there's some that are out there that aren't clear now they have less gelatin in them so they stay hard also I found that the harrybo brand of gummy bears are too hard also they are really dense and dry and it takes them a long time to diffuse like probably five days plus if you buy the ones that are super soft gummy bears they call them nowadays they won't hold up to the vodkas so just by everyday plain old dollar store type gummy bears not harrybo brand get ones you like to taste up because that's what it's gonna taste like when you're slamming it down anyways real easy we got like I said our gummy bears are gonna 5 ounce bag here and we've got a bottle of vodka mm-hmm and we have two mason jars what are we gonna do we're gonna put the bears into the mason jars top them off with vodka close it and let them sit for two days so we've got a real you know complex process here we've got our bag and our jar these have been sanitized already I like mason jars why well if you put them in a bowl what you can do the problem with that is you can't shake them okay or if you can't shake them it gets all over the place it or if you have to stir them sometimes it disturbs and breaks the gummy bears okay so here we have our two mason jars nice and sanitized and ready to go okay we've got our vodka we want to cover them with vodka inside the jar get them all happy this how we're going to get drunken gummy bears I've swirled them here we go let him go for a little bit of a swim I'm gonna go over the top oh I have to get some more vodka soon what a shame I have to go to the liquor store and shop for booze I hate that anyway so we have our jars here and each one has about an equal amount there over the top with vodka we're about a cup of vodka I think there's a little few more gummy bears in this one but anyways we've used about a cup total of vodka here real easy you can use any vodka you know what abused really cheap vodka sometimes you can taste that but you know what for the people who are gonna be drinking this and how you drink it it's not really for the taste is to get krump snell isn't it so we're gonna shake it let's be honest right give them a good shake boom and we're gonna let these sit for two days I'll be back after these guys get happy and they're getting their drink on now back in a flash hey guys forgot to mention one thing I know I didn't forget it because of all the drinking I do it's it's it's because I was so excited about this process anyways remember when yours letting me set for your two days you want to keep them in the refrigerator that'll help keep the gelatin together or while they're absorbing all this fun booze and you want to give them a little bit of shake now and again over the two day period so I'll see you in two days we'll be back and we're going to be having some fun with some big-ass gummies that are all full of smelly [Music] two days pass and as you can see here our gummies have drunk enough all that lovely vodka so now we have drunken gummies or fun alcoholic gummies that's right they've consumed all the vodka they've over doubled in size in the two days this particular brand seems to be doing really well in this real absorbent my tasted one of them and they're a little bit boozy so you say DJ what do you do if they're a little bit boozy and it all depends different gummies will taste sweeter than others because you know every mix and everything is a little bit different so I'm gonna reserve this one jar that has the last gummies in it and I think that some people will maybe like to taste that vodka and alcohol a little bit and some people won't so what do we do to counteract that we get some kool-aid concentrate here it's these little squirt bottles you can support this into your sports bottle make a quick bottle of sugar-free kool-aid or you can use it which it's real purpose is probably to put it into our gummies and we're gonna give them a little bit of kool-aid flavor and I'm gonna taste one of these here just in case for scientific purposes only and also to show you how much bigger that gummy is now he's really growing in size you can let me see I guess you can see them on the camera here I don't want to tip off but this is a green one let's see how it tastes hmm I still got that lime flavor when you chew it and eat it it has a consistency of jell-o now so I know these are just right it's got that vodka edge to it I know some of the ladies at the party aren't gonna like that vodka edge that's really who's gonna be eating these ladies and some of guys I want to get there quick crunk on so I'm gonna shake this up and this stuff's pretty powerful so you don't need a lot of it we're gonna put one two three four squirts in there that's it now alternately if you don't have this you can use concentrate for making like like fruit punch you know frozen concentrates it's just all it's basically the same kind of thing but this is a lot easier and we're gonna shake these up or but our gummies are bleeding now you can see all that alcohol and lovely booze and the sugar that's rendered out the gummies is sticking to the inside there so we're gonna let this get happy for another day I'll be back in another day it'll seem like a second for you but we'll have these four side-by-side comparison and we'll show you what they look like after they've absorbed some of this kool-aid concentrate and I'll tell you have to taste it hey guys I'm back you can see we got our two jars of gummies here one with concentrate for 24 hours and one without that have been still sitting happy in their liquid of happiness aka vodka and as you can see in the jars there's not too much liquid left but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna strain them out in with this little wire strainer here into our measuring cup and we'll show you how much rendered liquid is left leftover and I'll be back [Music] okay we're all done straining there are dummies out and look at what we've got here we've got two full bowls of our dummies we've got our ones that are flavored with the cherry kool-aid concentrate here on the on my right and we've got one without on the left now there looks like there's more in this bowl because there's more total gummies but they're all about the same size Dave mmm well more than doubled in size close to tripled and I think these ones here on the right with the concentrate maybe a little bigger because I have more vodka in the in the jar with those but if you take a look here on my measuring cup I've got a full math probably bout a quarter cup left now it's probably not all volume that's been generated by vodka because there's a little probably like gelatin like I don't know runoff from the gummies in there but that means these have absorbed probably a cup and a quarter of vodka into these guys so we've nearly tripled their size we've put all that lovely vodka in there and we flavor this and you say DJ what are those flavor Woods tastes like so got my spoon here let's show you what one of these guys look like I think this one was clear or orange in the beginning you can take a look at him or her whatever the case may be I think it's neuter in gummy bear land but let's see what these taste like oh yeah the flavored ones are super dangerous guys that kool-aid kool-aid concentrate really takes the edge off the vodka you can still tell us there because he'll they nearly tripled their size with vodka so you're gonna taste a little bit of boost but you could down a couple those and get blasted in a hurry and that's what little treats like this are for at a party when you're having a fun party but remember when you're enjoying this stuff you got to enjoy responsibility and if you got a guess that you're giving these two you also need to be good to them too and make sure they're not driving and being tanked up going home when they're paddling some of these buildings wow you can feel the warming going down on these guys but the way you take these the part of the way I like to take them apart is you take your jar here we'll clean this out before we do so and I like to take them in this jar here because it's got so that like moonshine look to it and it kind of makes them cool so you see we got real easy steps to make these dangerous little treat real tasty and if you've got folks that don't like that alcohol edge we know heading out how to take that alcohol edge off of these gummies and you can get your party on so guys thanks a million for watching I appreciate each and every one of you until the next DJ brew tube I guess this is kind of a mixed drink how-to I still haven't figured it out well maybe party libation how to or maybe it's not a libation because that means you're drinking um I don't know until the next ev32 thanks a million for watching and that's a

marijuana is generally a misdemeanor offense however it can be elevated into a felony in a number of ways and one way is when you take the actual substance in marijuana which is THC and that is extracted in some way and used to create something else than that all this sudden becomes a felony offense it's the substance that THC is considered a penalty group to substance which is a felony and we see this most often in cases involving edibles you take gummy bears for example that seem to be popular especially you can buy them in Colorado and other states and a package of gummy bears may actually contain a very small amount of THC but it is a felony offense or even a couple of them so be aware that what is normally a misdemeanor offense that you may think it's not all that serious when it's turned into something else when it's turned into an edible or something else you can consume then you're looking at a felony offense and your misdemeanor marijuana possession all of a sudden

half hour i started feeling weird oh no look at the timer i'm feeling the way i would describe the way i'm feeling right now is i would not go out if i was invited somewhere at this point i feel a storm coming all that matters right now is that clock keeps ticking there is a warning on the package that reads consumption of sugar-free candies may cause stomach discomfort and or laxative effect individual tolerance will vary if this is the first time you've tried these candies we recommend beginning with one fourth of a serving size or less this guy's making me confident that i have nothing to worry about so i'm gonna eat three more just to make it just to make it an even 30. there's nothing honestly if this guy can eat a whole bag well maybe even 30. i shouldn't have done that all right

accidentally eating candy infused with THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News

okay this is what a Big Mac looks like check it out it's not big enough we don't want the Big Mac fries look at them they're tiny I know I know go down master like when you guys know I need my good luck for my gummy videos let's try and a 200,000 thumbs up you've been killing it lately so I know let's get started so today I'm back with not only myself I know I'm the dummy god but I don't just Beth combine the camera so obviously we're gonna need some gelatin okay guys and you guys know I go hard on the gelatin so I got some gelatin bro are you serious am i serious about what - hey sugar flavor what it's a boy stuff this is possibly gonna be the biggest DIY I've ever done so basically you know I would explain everything I got but I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing so we're gonna figure out what we're doing as we go through the video basically what is in a Big Mac is there's bun meat lettuce pickles okay I'm not doing pickles but we got cheese more button more meat and fries so I got this mode for the top of the bun this mold for the bottom of the bun I got wolves for cheese I got wolves for tomato because you know you can't miss out on the tomato on a [ __ ] burger okay Big Mac I need to add tomatoes your burger you don't even like tomatoes I don't like tomato but everyone likes Tomatoes except for me I [ __ ] hate to me but I'd love to me exactly the Big Mac these Tomatoes we got molds for the patties we got moves for more patty we got molds for the middle one and we got normal for the lettuce and last but not least I got some primal picked up every [ __ ] morning all right this better be enough if not I'm really gonna be disappointed okay I don't want like in the story but you guys know how to make gelatin I don't know how to do it cuz I failed all my gelatin DIYs but Dustin knows how to make it so first step is to warm up what's first up water water big pot Brown cupboard that covers that cover right here okay I definitely lived in this house for a long time another one so everyone knows I'm the king of measuring on my channel obviously I always like to measure my stuff we're gonna measure half of a quarter of a Richter scale okay following along you're not I mean you gotta clean this bird but Richter scale measured me all you man circle shape and that's I'm pretty sure that just equals out to one of those folds now you need the hexagon oval oval shape and then just do it so let's fill it up guys and obviously you know what I'm filling it out there's this way you can do it but there's also this way so what I like to do is sometimes have a little fun with my camera mom just come in are you serious okay so we got one but it'd be the same technique with the second row this sprays too much mom come here for a second I need you to walk under this you don't want to come here so what you're boiling water guys it's a common misconception everybody think mom does wrong it off put it to medium-high and then to the little guys because we'd like to be productive on my channel in the meantime we are gonna be making this McDonald's fry box and my mom's actually gonna be making it I bought some [ __ ] marker to do the shading so mom when you can't make something yourself guys you got to get your arts and crafts mom basically if you want to make anything into the magic shape anybody watch Wizards of Waverly Place cuz I [ __ ] did I love that show okay I don't know if you guys know but Justin Bieber got his instagram back so you're gonna be like Justin Bieber got a finger back touch it in a [ __ ] turn into a fry box let's do this you do it I don't know what I'm doing recipe right yeah you gotta commit to it we'll do it together three two one Justin Bieber guts fry box just like that there's nothing over here you need to worry about nothing over my dad look we're gonna do the end on this box I know it looks better with an Emmy my mom drew this and that's definitely not this do the comparison this looks like Whoopi and this looks like a Ryan's reason not to mention it might not fit on the box guys the box is so blessed so let's go through the GI Bill I bet Raghu lon Eli beeline so as you guys can see the pot is steaming hot right now we're gonna put half the band in each pot like so and it's already starting to solidify oh we're supposed to whisk it this is the small way where's the biz Rick it's not apologetic you can never have too much gelatin I don't know if your science teacher told you otherwise they were wrong wolf he's always right [Music] now that the gelatin is a bit warm we're gonna put the sugar into so we're gonna use half of it in this one this is enough to give you instant diabetes so what is high laid everything out on the table guys we are gonna have to fill all of that up with do you like be alive heal I'm feeling the rest of the gelatin is going in this one and you have to whisk it right away otherwise it will get higher the amount of gelatin I got could feed six hundred families you know throw the bacon and we're gonna pour it into each of the mold so we're gonna start with the buttons tell me that doesn't smell yeah [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] okay we got the top button now the bottom button so now that the top and bottom funds are good we're gonna grab the middle one oh my god that's uncontrollable it's leaking every why is the price old brown so when you [ __ ] up guys don't worry we're recovering I did that on purpose guys I'm gonna teach you guys what happens when you [ __ ] up we're gonna pour this into this well just a nice yellow fry like so there we go so while that gelatin is cooking I'm just gonna add some food coloring in each thing fries need to be extra yellow so I'm putting a lot of yellow food coloring just to make sure they stay golden yellow crispy McDonald's fries you know how they are I also got a little bit of icing coloring but this stuff is super saturated super concentrated you don't want to use too much of this otherwise it'll turn oh I forgot to tell you about that your stained that's it no no no 100% staying for a week oh my god my fingers are now tinted yellow forever it's gonna put a little bit of that something okay guys we got the brown icing sugar I'm not saying my finger Brown I don't want you did you [ __ ] him wave your eyes it does not clean it we got to be very careful with the brown guys oh I said I'm talking about okay got my strawberry flavoring we're just gonna be flavoring the patty strawberries super strong yeah it's super strong okay so you use it all right tuberous Robbie said to crush me oh it's all gone okay so for the button we're gonna do a little bit of pure lemon extract apparently it's not sour I don't believe it that's heat units our boat holy [ __ ] that's bad next one we're preparing the lettuce the tomatoes and the cheese we're going to need our pan dusting can you take the top off for me please I like that nice and oily there can never be too much oil there as if you actually made that we're gonna be making the lettuce you want the legs to be nice and crinkly oh that's a good idea where he's pulling it through the door how is he still pulling it so like I was saying guys we're just gonna need about this bigger piece for this okay we need this lettuce shape number one BAM that's that romaine right there that's that good [ __ ] she's a little bit of orange oh that's nice that's what I'm talking well that's that expensive cheddar cheese that you get from the gums actually dogs are not about expensive stuff quality it's quality you know it's part to be pleased so for the tomatoes we have red food coloring and red icing color we're gonna use the food coloring because we don't want it to be too red three dots of that should be good enough those are nice tomatoes those are really nice no you would not so basically now all we have to do is leave all these to cool down for like the next eight to ten hours but I'm just gonna leave them overnight for a full day so I can make sure they solidified and I will be back when they freeze tomorrow all right guys day two we are back everything should be gummy let's go to the washroom and check it out as you can see you guys I told I'm gonna put a sign do not enter a gummy inside so that's how you know shit's important yeah so here's what we got it smells [ __ ] absolutely delicious actually let's see how one thing is that's [ __ ] gummy it doesn't even look fully gummy but that is way more successful than I thought so now what we're gonna do is bring everything out to the table and make the DIY biggest gummy burger McDonald's Big Mac burger in existence I don't want any of you guys telling me I'm not the goat I'm the DIY gummy goo right and I got check this out this is like some thin plastic looking material the buns are nice tomato and ketchup are nice we're gonna start with the fried okay so Dustin's working on taking out the fries we're gonna take them out and then put them on a cutting board and cut them after that's the way it's gonna go they just can't break on us if they break up this it's about to [ __ ] swing down and smoke you in the head yeah anyways like I say hopefully they don't break on us please gummy just come out in one piece I need everyone to smash that like button right now if one thing breaks then basically were [ __ ] so give me all the good luck guys I'm not good with gummies you know I fail all the time let's plop this over and see what this bad boy is saying three two one no nothing it's not coming out this is not good right now oh it's coming it's coming it's coming when you just suction it's gonna break let's go look at these McDonald's fries just finishing up on the fries guys we hold the knife so it is just gliding in like butter this fry is a little broken by the neck but we're gonna try and MacGyver a way to fix this but at least these fries are flawless so in order to get the fries to stand up we need to have a backing behind them otherwise they're just gonna snap off so we're gonna use wrist the board that I got but the thing about this is I wrap the tape around it thinking it was a good like life hack but it's now stuck I pull it and my mom gets pulled with it we're pulling the wrong way we got it off okay so now we are starting with the bird the first thing we need is the bottom of the bun three two one oh let's go okay so the next thing on a Big Mac if we look at this cheese we're gonna put on some cheese nice lay it on so that it hangs off the front oh my gosh delicious next is the Patty three two one oh yeah look at this concentration guys it needs a magic Wolfie top that is a patty if I've ever seen one that looks beautiful the cheese on the front of patty god damn what is next on this boiler oh yeah dehydrated drop cake okay we gotta be strategic with how we place these now we need to go a little bit to the left because it's tilting a bit to the right more cheese align it with the other cheese some lettuce because you know diet Wolfie is still alive and well so here we go let's go let us look at that so I'm over here too even though the weight will do Tomatoes next quick little yay whoa Oh tomato god this is just getting more unstable by the second yeah yeah I'm really scared we are limited on time all that's under the patty we have another yeah but the Patty's supposed to go under the tomato you have a Big Mac right there how did you yeah the party goes on top really patty goes on top confirm that it's the last thing the hell is Hattie bun Big Macs also don't have tomatoes do they don't but my Big Macs I've tomato this cannot breathe hi this is it too many I say we go over there right a bit there's a good balance drop panicky the ketchup does not want to move ketchup done three two one will expand kick the table world [Music] yes we're just taking the thumbnail but the burger is starting to crack my mom is behind me and trip me it's all good take the fries away this is way behind the scenes overthrown there looks like behind you the fries in front of the price where the burgers don't panic you're good you're good 100% you can you see my mom my right arm is numb I'm taking that time now bro it looks beautiful though it looks good it looks great Oh still looking great all covered so guys check it out basically we have the fries these are definitely hard to like just keep up we have to put some support sticks inside each fry just to make sure they stand up but compared to regular McDonald's fries and the burger I mean there's not much else to say compared to a regular Big Mac anyways we're just gonna get a nice cut through the door any other nice burger I feel like once we start cutting it's okay it's not sharp enough you got a machete guys be very careful okay yeah good I'll give you a fried first yeah here's your fries I need to have a McDonald's try to compare it pretty good cuz I wanted I don't want to eat too much down there yeah it looks good oh my god it's not bad yeah take a slice people are you doing that's been said you would take a slicer boom got some nice slices I've ever seen one that's all you need neat ketchup you need

a little nitro all right we out", "i1etHmADoHk": "hey guys it is so gloomy outside right now I just want to make some hot chocolate and cuddle up under a blanket on the couch and watch TV but yesterday when it was all so gloomy I spent my day in the kitchen making some DIY fruit snacks some of you might call them gummy some of you might call them Fruit Chews but no matter what you call them these actually are really yummy and they're really easy to make too I picked up some unflavored gelatin from my local Target you can find this from many grocery stores and for those of you who live the vegan lifestyle I found a website that might help you out with some unflavored gelatin that will work for your diet so if you go to a website called vegan essentials comm I've never shopped on this before but I just wanted to do a little research for you guys there's a product called Lieber's unflavored jello you use in place of the unflavored gelatin if you don't want to use this product the other things you'll need are 100% fruit juice and any type of silicone mold if you don't have a mold you can always just use a dish and pour it in kind of like jello and cut it into little squares or use a cookie cutter which I'll show you in this video before we get into the video a little bit about what's coming up on Friday I got this yarn I'm planning on making a loom knit yarn hat if you don't have a yarn loom you could probably just use a container and like I showed you in the yarn flower you could make your own loom somehow this one's out of thin yarn so this one with the thicker yarn will look much better and be a lot more cozy but this was just a test so if you like this idea let me know and I haven't tied it off yet if you're interested in seeing Friday's video and all of my upcoming Christmasy and holiday videos then please subscribe to my channel and click the thumbs up button and now let's get into making some yummy fruit snacks yummy gum you see for this recipe I'm going to be using some unflavored gelatin some 100% fruit juice any flavor that you want and a silicone mold I purchased my adorable mold from amazon.com I'll give you the link to that in the description box below also honey is optional for more sweetness and you'll want to use during spoons imagine cup a pot to mix in I'm beginning by getting a measuring cup and I'm just going to pour one cup of juice into that now pour your juice into the pot and you're going to measure two tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're using the exact same gelatin the I am you'll just use three of the packets let the powder completely absorb into the juice and then mix it together once it's nicely mixed you're going to turn on the flame to a low to medium heat and then you're going to just heat that up until you can't see any more powder it will just be really liquidy and at this point you can use some honey for more flavor you can use any type of essential oil such as vanilla or mint any type of flavoring that you want to and just add that into the pot now I'm using a syringe that I got from the pharmacy at Target they just gave it to me so if you go up and ask if they sell them they might just give you one I washed this with soap and hot water and then I am just filling it up with the mixture this just makes it a lot easier to fill up your little tiny silicone molds then if you have any mixture left over which I do you can just pour it into a plate with a groove or you can use any type of Bowl or glass pan to pour this into then you're going to put all your gelatin into the refrigerator and let it chill for maybe an hour it might not take that long but just to be safe and then once it's completely hardened you'll remove it of course and here I'm showing you that you can make little hearts or whatever shape you want by using cookie cutters and you can of course eat all the excess that is left over then the ones in the mold of course you'll just pop out carefully at all the cute little shapes will be revealed for my next batch I cut the recipe so I only used 1/3 of the ingredients and I'm actually using food coloring to color the apple juice since it's a really light color so instead of using 1 cup of juice I used 1/3 cup and that is enough to fill up this mold and still have some left over and then you just use one packet of the gelatin if you're using the box I am and any amount of other flavoring that you want and there you have it personalized gummies you can make any shape that you want and you can make any flavor essentially - so these are really cute and really fun snacks to have around I love eating gummies I think they're so yummy so this is a perfect way to make your home I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you did please give it a

marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

everything heat it up and then we're going to make these into beautiful gorgeous uh gummy bears that are natural colors no additives no food coloring and yeah actually just using my measuring cup two ounces is fourth cup you can also use a scale um but i like using my liquid measuring cup and i'm making a mess which is normal all that good old carrot juice just sitting on the counter so this is two ounces i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to add the aggregate and i'm going to do this for every single one just doing a quick photo shoot of everything so you guys can see what it looks like this is for my thumbnail and this looks so pretty it's a purple color um but i know if you add an acid so like a lemon juice or lime juice it turns pink so i'm actually gonna do that but yeah guys these are all the ingredients i'm letting the carrot juice actually half of it is on the stove heating up and then we're gonna add agar agar at all and make our beautiful natural gummy bears so after a couple of minutes on the heat i've heated up the carrot juice you can see it change it color and we're just actually going to add this directly to our dropper or gummy bear mold not our dropper using our dropper you just want to make sure most of your um what is it called i got argos dissolve you can see it but this is very good so i'm just i added in one tablespoon of uh which i'm gonna call it what is this called this stuff agave and then i also added in a half a teaspoon of ginger powder because i love the taste of ginger it's also very medicinal so yeah we're just gonna drop it in there so using our dropper we're just gonna go right in there we're gonna fill it up and we're gonna drop it in our mold this does not hold a lot it's so cute and then you're just gonna repeat this until all of them are full i might not even need all this liquid to be completely honest i'm only going to do three rows of this one and then i'm going to fold do the same process with all the other ones and i'll be back to show you guys what the gummy looks like but same exact process heat your liquid up add one and a half teaspoon of agar agar powder a tablespoon to two tablespoons of your sweetener of choice and yeah that's all and then fill it up in your mold the mold and everything will be listed down in the description bar this one i want to see you guys i want to show you guys how to change the color of this because you see what color it is now we're going to do this in slow motion so for the clear gummies i decided to use some of my hibiscus and rose water it's super easy to make and i'm going to use this to make my clear gummies and i'm also going to fill in the rest of them this tastes and smell just like hibiscus and rose it is so flavorful and then i'm also going to use some of the leftover pineapple juice to fill in the extra so yeah i'm super excited to make this into the clear gummies and then i'll show you guys can you see they're so adorable and cute and jelly you can see the jello consistency they're not too sticky actually and they're so cute look at it so i'm going to take them all out and plate them look at them they're so cute and these are the pineapple ones they're so cute okay so these are all the gummies they're kind of sticking together so i'm gonna rub them with cornstarch as she suggests in her video which is linked down below for those looking to make um gummies out of jello some jellos i think are vegan i would have to double check that and i'll let you guys know down in the description bar but these are what mines look like again i'm using these for vitamin purposes if you're using if you're looking to make a more gummy i will put some other substitutes for gelatin down in the description bar below okay we're going to go through the flavors so this first one right here is a pineapple and carrot the one following it is elderberry this one next to it is carrot this one is pineapple this one is butterfly pea flour tea with key lime this one below it is the butterfly pea without key lime this one is my rose water hibiscus water with a little bit of agave this one's spirulina this one's just green tea and this one is elderberry those are all of the flavors that i created and they look so cute so in regards to flavor my favorite two ones are the butterfly pea little phase three um the pineapple and the elderberry i'm gonna try the green tea one now because i didn't try it yet and then i'll let you guys know yeah so these four right here are my favorite the other ones are just from medicinal like medical not medical but for vitamins because you know you need to consume them every day the best place to store these are in the fridge i'm going to dust mines with a little bit of corn starch so they don't stick together in a little bit of sugar but yeah that's how you make vegan gummy bears they're not super gummy but they get the job done you", "7LjOR_IG69w": "hello everybody and welcome to my channel my name is londo and this is my new channel where i make asmr videos i just recently got this blue yeti microphone for christmas from my lovely partner scott so shout out to scott thank you for everything and i love you today i thought that i would try out by doing something really fun that i always see on youtube which are when creators use food items to make a really cool video and so today i thought that i would use some of these horrible gold bears that i also got for christmas from scott's family these are probably one of my favorite gummy bears out there there's just nothing that is as good as these ones it says on here that this is apparently the holiday edition and so we only have the raspberry and strawberry flavors so that's kind of neat because then at least we get to just eat the really good ones so let's take them out of the package now but first i know everybody wants to hear a little bit of the tingling i guess i meant to say the tap [Applause] i keep having this issue of bringing them on the other side of the mic i need to get used to um doing this in front of the camera so please bear with me i will get uh used to this in due time okay i'm really struggling to get it open so give me one second oh there we go just have to pull it a little bit oh there we go [Music] um if you can see my table right now i just uh dropped a bunch of gummy bears all over it so let me try to pick up some of these really quickly i'm sure my niece and nephew would be having a heyday right now just loving this okay so as i said before we do have the green one which is strawberry and then we have the red one which is raspberry and now that's kind of confusing because usually we use red and our candy colors to denote strawberry and raspberry but i guess in this sense that since it is a holiday edition and most likely for christmas they were going for that red and green palette because um you know christmas and they wanted to distinguish the two different flavors if they were both red it might be kind of hard for them to um or for the users to understand which is which so without further ado i almost just ate that um i'm gonna eat this green one which is strawberry so let's see and it makes me feel well really good of course because it's sugar but i mean i feel a little bit like naughty i guess by uh chewing with my mouth open because i feel like i've been trying to teach my niece and nephew who are like six and five to start chewing with their mouth clothes and then you have me making youtube videos where i start chewing with my mouth open but kids if you are watching this this is just for the video so that way you can kind of get to hear what the sounds are like when you have something like this okay so now i have the other one which is watermelon and why did i say watermelon that's raspberry oh my god all right guys let's do it i need more sugar and they don't really make a lot of noise i thought that they were going to be a little bit more fun you know around the microphone maybe like you would hear it squish or something like that maybe if i adjust the settings up a little bit more you could hear more of that fine-tuned yeah all right there we go i think you can kind of hear hopefully hopefully my voice isn't killing you can i hear it squishy ah it's getting stuck to my fingers okay let me turn this back down and as i mentioned earlier this is my first video so i still have a lot to learn and i'm sure i'm gonna go back to this and just probably criticize the crap out of myself so that way i can you know give some good feedback and make better videos in the future but i just figured that this was to be a lot of fun so i really wanted to get out there and start doing it and start putting myself into the youtube world so let's have some more again the green ones are strawberry [Music] i have this really lovely painting behind me um which is actually been turned into a tapestry by the artist and she only sells so many of these every time that she makes a release of her items on her store site and so i had to rush over to get it right away when she tweeted that she was releasing more items so i was really glad that i did end up getting this one i think that it's pretty cool backdrop and i hope that in the future that i can get more of these and just kind of share the art that i see across the internet and help other people get their message across and that freedom of expression that we all are really craving now let's go for a raspberry one um i have to say that these are really good like there's just nothing better than a freaking horrible gold bear and i know that these aren't gold but that's just the name of the box like that's just how it is so there you go i'm also really glad that i took the time to clean up my fingers and make them look really camera ready um a lot of times i'll be making videos for my instagram page because i cook a lot and i feel really bad because my fingers will get messy or i'll have like flour or just like cocoa underneath my fingers and it just like looks like i'm really sloppy but i swear i'm clean okay i'm gonna go for another one of these red bad boys because this happened to be my new favorite and i wish that haribo would actually add raspberry into their regular line of gummy bears so horrible if you're out there and you're listening to this yes i did say that you should add that into it i lied i'm gonna have another one of these too thanks for coming to my channel thanks for watching this video please like comment subscribe let me know what you think i hope to see you all in the very near future have a good one peace", "rZor_LEp9Ss": "hi what do you do when you're low carb high fat and you still want to have treats for your kids well you can make it them yourself which is always a great idea because you know exactly what's going to get in them if you've read any of the reviews about gummy bears or gummy worms the sugar free version on Amazon you'll know that those are not a great option for us or for our children they have sweeteners that cause digestive distress and probably act as a laxative better than commercial laxative medicines so we're gonna make our iron because we don't want to give that stuff to our kids so what I'm starting with is 12 ounces of hot water it's probably more like warm water by now and actually it shows about a cup say maybe at my Keurig rizal of it so it's a cup of really warm water and we're gonna decide what flavor we want to use now I'm making this for the kids and have a strawberry flavor I ordered this off of Amazonas by frontier and we really like this this is a strawberry flavor I'm gonna use there's a blueberry I have an apple these are great which I may do next and then watermelon so you can find lots of flavors that don't have icky stuff in them I'm going to use two actually want to start with one tablespoon and try it often the amount that you use will vary depending on how much water you're using and how strong you like it so you've add your flavoring and then I'm going to add just a am about a quarter of a teaspoon of lemon juice I know I'm making strawberry but the lemon juice really helps it's a little more than a quarter of a teaspoon closer to a half a teaspoon and then we're going to use sweetener now with this sweetener you want to add a little more than when you're tasting then before you put the gelatin in and we're going to put four tablespoons of the grass-fed gelatin but I'm going to put 20 drops of liquid sucralose for five that is 20 good job whoops and I'm using this grass-fed gelatin this is Great Lakes grass-fed be gelatin has fed beef and you can use Knox that you can find at Walmart or your local grocery store just use an unflavored gelatin I don't like the sugar-free gelatinous because they generally have a key ingredients in them I'm gonna give that a stir see if we've got enough sweetener and enough strawberry flavor mmm that tastes really good I want it intense so I am gonna do another about a teaspoon of the strawberry flavor the lemon adds a lot to it as well it's really nicely sweet so I don't know that we need to add any more sweetener to it those tiny drops may be sufficient you could also use stevia and you could use that is so good you can use two via or whatever liquid sweetener you prefer you could use something like a confection or sweetener you want something that's going to dissolve fully and not be too grainy and I think even add more sweetener to that we'll see it's hard to tell as thin as it is excuse me not a sweetener more strawberry flavoring now this is the four tablespoons of across that gelatin and again use your Knox if you want stir as you add and sprinkle it in don't dump it in or it will get clumpy on the air now these are gonna be white you could add food coloring but I'm not crazy about giving my kids red dye another thing that you could do is you could puree a couple of strawberries especially if they're in season puree those strain it to get the seeds out and that would help give it the red color that we expect when you have strawberries now sprinkle it in and I'm stirring as I go and you just want to get it all dissolved it doesn't have to be super super hot this gelatin especially will do okay with what our that's per yeah with water that's pretty much room temperature you could also use a tea when I made the gummy worms for throat lozenges I used a sinus either tea and that worked really well so if there's a strawberry flavored tea you could use that as well whatever liquid you're using you just mix in the gelatin and it's hard to sprinkle it because I'm getting conscious of time and once I get this in I'm going to step outside and mix it well and I'll taste it again because like I said sometimes your sweetener and your flavor disappears there is a little bit of taste to the UM the orange can and I do get this you're going to ask where I get it I get this at Amazon and I can't remember the price on it it is more expensive than the Knox because it is grass-fed I've used both I've used the Knox when I've been out of this and needed it right away and gelatin is good to have on hand some people put it in their coffee they put it in different drinks it's supposed to be great for gut health and it supposed to be great for bone health so if you have osteoarthritis or painful joints in your knees or shoulder it supposed to be really good and healing for that there is a green can version that doesn't gel that some people use instead say yeah usefully I can get my hands on I do have a little few lumps in this that I can see because it's clear let's see where we're doing on flavor that's really pretty tasty I am going to use and it's thick already I am gonna use another tablespoon of strawberry because I want it strong and I'm going to use a little more sweetener because I want it strong and I'll see if I need lemon juice in this it's so interesting because where I used three tablespoons of strawberry I might make the blueberry and use two tablespoons and it seemed like too much so you can't always tell the the recipes don't translate evenly from one thing to the next I've used three tablespoons of this and it's good stuff I use that and you can use it in cocktails too this is really good I think we finally found a sweet spot with us okay so it's gelling up and I'm going to put it into moulds and again probably if I had strawberries I would puree them and add a few just to our color these are candy molds these are not ideal your silicone molds are really a lot better for this but I'm going to fill these up and I'll put it in the fridge and it doesn't take long at all it only takes close to well depends on how warm your liquid is but it's about 20 minutes or so for it to set up and you can have gummies now I'm using a heart mold which would be great for Valentine's Day especially if I had added the strawberries to make it red you can use forever molds and I have red I hadn't been able to do it but I have right if you let this set up for a little bit you can put it in a ziploc bag and stream it out as gummy worms so that you don't have to have the molds we're using molds for flowers and hearts right now but the silicone molds do work better so let me fill these up and then we'll see what they look like so our gummies are ready and these are the strawberry ones and again kind of wish I'd pureed some strawberries but they're really cute this is a heart and I know it's gonna be hard for you to see the shapes this is a tulip and these are molds I just got at Michaels and my hands are clean they're stained from working with other things this is a little flower and I was going to show you the silicone molds are much easier to work with this was the heart mold this is a candy mold but I just got at Michaels but if you run a toothpick around the edges you can kind of pop it out a bit onto the plate or into your hands things are sticky and that's how they look there's their little hearts I do have gummy bears and you can buy gummy worms online and you're just gonna pop them out with a little toothpick if you leave some of the gelatin on the sides they're a little easier to dig out and like I said if you're using a silicone mold they're easier now this is a strawberry flavor and the flavor wasn't as strong before I made them but now that they dried let's give one a try and they're not as chewy as traditional gummies but they're actually pretty tasty so these are a treat that you can make for your kids I don't know that my kids friends when they're over and I make things like this they're really impressed they're like wow your mom makes homemade gummies um and you can also let your kids make them this sells and my daughter is in middle school and she's getting to the age where it's really cool for her and her friends to be in the cancer and creating well they're also learning as they go these are my low carb gummy bears and I hope that if you make them for your family you enjoy them too", "bYpk6tIa5bw": "so in

warm white pine these are already open please my daughter open them i really suggest the walmart tank so then also you're gonna need your chili powders again you're gonna need candy powders I have Miguelito I have this fancy go Rico I have this new one that I bought it's called super Rico for Vito and I'm gonna put close-ups of all of them or a picture of all of them so you guys can see I have

called blue says got las I'm gonna put a close-up so you guys can see so basically this is somebody though I think yeah it says that my dingo it's just a big consistency like that and I'm just gonna show you guys how you can do it with different products it doesn't necessarily have to be the powdered sugar and chumlee mixture so I'm gonna melt this in the microwave for 10 seconds I'm gonna bring you guys in closer so I can see what's going on I'm gonna get my candy that I showed you guys and with the fork I'm just gonna scoop some in there I just got about that much because I'm I'm just gonna do one pack of gummy bears so I'm gonna scoop that in there and then I'm gonna pour some Chum way in there as well don't put too much cuz you can always put more so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna put this in the microwave for 10 seconds and I'll be right back okay so this is right up right out the microwave so I don't know if you guys could tell but it melted a lot so I'm just gonna mix this and if you guys can see this is very very thick and we kind of want it a little bit more runny so I'm gonna add more Chum winter do you wanna just okay so that I wanna say that's kind of the consistency we're going for it I'm gonna do this much I only did a little bit because I don't want to make too much so now I'm gonna get my container and I'm gonna pour my gentlemen with my gummy bears in there and I'm just using the Walmart kind the great value and I'm gonna pour this mixture over it and I I didn't use all of it but are you quite a bit of it what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna mix this and I'm gonna mix it very well [Music] [Music] so I'm just gonna stop right there and I'm gonna get a separate container in this container I have a live with it so I'm gonna put my gummy bears in there and I'm gonna start pouring in my powder so I'm gonna first start with this what the cool powders that I showed you guys right here and I'm just gonna drizzle it all over it okay I'm gonna use the particular eco Clady powder now I'm giving you stacking and I mean this just depends all on your preference you like a lot of time if you don't like it too spicy I'm gonna use the Valentina seasoning I'm using all the seasonings my short jaw in the beginning of the video I'm using super Rico and I'm gonna use a little bit of Miguelito I'm actually you put just a little bit more Tajin in it okay so now you want to cover your container you want to make sure you mix this very well okay so now that I've done shaking it I'm gonna go ahead and open it so you guys can see and there you have it delicious gummy bears enchilados I hope you guys like this video and I'll see you guys on my next video bye okay so here's a close-up so you guys could see how long they left don't eat [Laughter]", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

guess that you would want to be mulan because you were obsessed with mulan for a couple months when the movie came out and you liked that character since last year then i moved on to stitch there isn't a costume for stitch though i can make it a mangas character or monkeys i'm not familiar with the language it's a game i know it's a game i've seen you play it a couple of times is it just like hide and seek no how do you play that game so it's like um there's like either like two or one imposters and uh you can dress up when you're waiting for like more people to join because you have like these like a maximum like it's either 10 or like maybe four people so and then i always joined like almost like nine players to 10 so and then i joined and then um so we have to figure out who's the imposter so if if the impostor kills someone and you turn into a ghost and you try to have to do all the tasks to win tasks i mean and find the imposter yeah and the other p people have to report the body and the imposters can vent like go through um like vents and then um um the crewmates can like uh pool mates yeah crewmates they can press an emergency button and they can report the body and find out who is the imposter and then they just go floating around when they they so does the imposter like try to take you out like try to kill you in the game uh um or do you just have to figure out who it is yeah you have to figure out like the crewmates like one imposter if and impossible because you're really good if the imposter kills you you turn into a ghost and you have to finish all tasks to win if you're a see you ghost and you can't um like help anyone and you can text in the game but if you're a ghost you cannot text no one can see you yeah it's like serious like in two if there's two girls a ghost and there's one more ghost so three ghosts you can talk to the two other goats ghosts because they're ghosts you lost me at ghost your mind you should try these gummies these are supposed to be zombie gummies you know actually quite tasty and they're not too sweet so which is good oh man oh good i think i'm gonna try the brain here the brain it was a little sour when i had a

it going on one of my late night but I got souffle fleet they put it on spin move that we go be like s adaboost so without further ado it's a close-up hi Bert Club and get some little bird emojis flap in the comment section taking a look at base edibles they look at these dank gummies and these have 802 THC content of 500 milligrams for this entire package now each dose is about 3 pieces and that gives you about 50 milligrams of THC now eaten well ingesting cannabis is blade different than smoking it when your liver has to process it it gives you a way different hide then when you inhale it's a total body high where I'm smoking it gives you basically just a head um docena says that the appropriate dosage for these is different for each person and been conditioned so freebo taking these willy-nilly make sure that your you know how much they take for whatever problem you're taking them for if you're just using them recreationally still use caution when using or consuming these won't get take a look at some of these out the pack so let's get somebody's out this pack I got over here these are the gummies look like you can see inside here they have a blue one right here I see a blue one in this pack so there's no not really telling what colors you're gonna get um they're coated with like a looks to be like a sugary thing they're pretty soft like they're room temperature so there Gummy's guess if you froze on these stiffen up a lot I'm going to guess we'll eat the green one why not eat the green one and see what that tastes like so just pop this thing I see how we do I burped about to take one of these dank gummies now I have already took one earlier and I can feel fill it slightly I've been smoking all day but it's a very different kind of feeling and it's more of a relaxing feeling I will probably go to sleep right now sleep all night wanna try this bring window you know hopefully it'll uh increased my abilities sleeping Mike I don't typically sleep too well but I'm hopefully tonight these will help me crash there's a very slight cannabis scent from it it smells more like candy than cannabis not sure this is I want to say this might be Apple but also it also might be a line I want to say a Pluto John taste this sugar sugar doesn't seem to have that much of a cannabis taste on it and must be more inside the gummy so I'm gonna pop this in give it a couple chose and see if it tastes like alright that was a very nice apple taste didn't have a nice cannabis undertone to it too very chewy gummy unless you could kind of help with the texture of it yeah we'll check back this is a cold minute no all right berth up almost forgot check it for me for me it'd be very relaxed deep fry sleep forever right now gummies I mean it tastes real good got a nice cannabis tasting [Music]", "oHn0K1PN1tg": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] let's go [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] knowing that you're the tiniest guy in the sky [Laughter]

to know that ingesting cannabis can have a much more powerful effect than they might have expected this morning comes after an NBA player apparently had his own bad experience with edibles Michels rap yo is here with more so what happened to this NBA player now well his name is dion Waiters and essentially on Thursday night his team the Miami Heat they were on this chartered plane going from Phoenix to Los Angeles and all sudden he had this severe panic attack he was what waiters treated on the plane and it was then discovered that he had actually earlier consumed a cannabis edible now according to reports we're talking about a gummy bear edible something that waiters was consumed in order to combat a stomachache and that panic attack really ensured that he could not play either Friday or Saturday's game but it is as you say Diane also a warning about how something that may look innocuous could actually cause unintended consequences we all know cannabis now legal in this country and edible products well they became legal last month and Health Canada says edible products will start to hit store shelves by mid-december and the challenge right now really is about communicating the safe way of consuming these products if an individual chooses to do so because when it does come to edible cannabis a little does go a long way and unlike smoking or vaping animal products can take some time before your body can start feeling the effects which really does create this danger of consuming too much as people look for a buzz a high or any kind of relief that they want out of a product and to that take a listen to dr. Joseph Fink ler he is from the emergency department of st. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver often what happens with people in just one they don't feel any response they ingest another and another and then a couple of hours later when it's metabolized absorbed by your digestive system you get a real bolus of the active ingredient or chemical in your body and it feels weird and more weird than you would expect in people's reaction as a panic attack they feel anxious because this is not what they expected and it's way more yeah not what they expected way more that might have what happened with dion Waiters reports say that he was not familiar with edibles he was not familiar with the side effects we also can tell you that he's now been suspended for ten games without pay because the NBA well they don't allow any kind of THC products to be consumed by their players right it's so important that you're getting this message out there Michael because people do have this terrible reaction and I'm sure you know these things are going to be all over the market there's such a variety of them people are going to be going to the emergency room or whatever clogging up the healthcare system what does Health Canada say about well you're right and there is a concern about people not knowing what to do so they're trying to get ahead of the matter take a look what Health Canada is saying about edible products here they say that when it comes to edible cannabis it can take up to 30 minutes to two hours after consuming a product to feel the effects and sometimes it can take up to four hours before feeling the full effects so it's important to know that while the amount of THC might look small and edible products it does carry quite the punch in fact once consumed by ingesting rather than inhaling the body turns that THC into a stronger form called eleven hydroxy THC so to minimize the risk look for products that contain two point five milligrams of THC or less if you consume stronger doses while exercise caution they say and know that just one of the side effects could be a panic panic attack it could be a lot more so read up know what you're getting into before you actually start consuming edibles okay thank you so much Michael you're welcome", "RjYfaCoq8-8": "happy Wednesday it's Ali and I am back with another video this week I am doing another DIY because my win last week it's literally today it's been five days and it has

name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much for watching I hope to see you next time and shout", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "YlzkjcxX3EY": "Lala yeah I class I and karzai oh oh hi Oh dad that's what he wants oh I know I thought oh god car yet okay clean it I thought oh yeah

destiny people and when people win as well as we all did that means they get to eat sugarfree gummy bears uh do you know anything about this the reviews on Amazon for over touches these gummy bears so here we got our so popular first of all let's do we had to buy this bag ok so talk about the price yeah yeah yeah how much okay let's Astro how much do you think this bag of gummy bears costs on Amazon it's it's 5 pounds it's just 5 pounds of gummy bears now let me put this into perspective the sugary version of these is like 9 bucks mm-hmm less than 10 bucks I was gonna guess ten dollars so I'll say a little bit more maybe it's fancier 15 $100 one well you just gave it away $100 I was gonna be like higher lower like you no no okay no I'm holding a Benjamin yeah yeah and that $100 it's heavier and the reason why a cinderblock it's because the reviews are so funny that the item went viral now should we eat some of these while you're telling me yeah yeah um is this kind of like the cookbook have you seen microwaving four-one-oh no but I should look into that there's a cookbook called microwaving for one and Elizabeth little lady wind microwaves were first came out they're really popular oh it's not a joke it's kind of sad because I think she lost her spouse and now she's microwaving for one so it's kind of depressing but it became like really popular on reddit and this book that was like five dollars is now more expensive because it's kind of this microwaving oh  I own it okay see while you're chewing on this just to have one just just one drop what's all the rage about David just hold on to that other one don't eat it you the title of david's review is fully weaponized gummi bears I bought it back because I'm trying to cut down on sugar it seemed Haribo has replaced the sucrose and a typical batch of gummy bears with : shredding rage just a couple of handfuls left me crying for my mommy on the bathroom floor parenthesis I am 43 years old what well you won't eat that other one here's one by a little nervous here's one by Sims here is only one way to say it it's by one way there's only one way to say it I sneezed out of my buttonhole I want Rosana to read these okay can we let her reading of course um-hmm um-hmm right here oh this is continued yeah let it read that wrong it'd be like a bedtime story for my lower GI tract oh here we go when the rumbling started I sprinted down the hallway and made it to the bathroom just in time for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to stampede from my backside laying waste to my home septic system and my will to live oh you want an island here already so I read some here they go why don't how many of you want ranks I've eaten too how many of you eaten - I don't know if I should do anymore based on these reviews they don't taste that bad but I'm really getting nervous every anything with sugar alcohol in it you know like uh like if you do like the low carb diet like my wife went to this thing where she was getting like the Atkins bars oh gosh and they have sugar alcohol in it which is a sweetener that you know is it's not sugar it's not sugar mm-hmm but it can have a horrible effect on your bow case-in-point Christopher gray his post is entitled space-time continuum I have observed an interesting phenomenon when I eat these I am temporarily granted the power to poop things I didn't actually eat here's one from Greg be a fight I do not bring to sporting event other than the war that the bottom half of my body is currently having with this porcelain chair it is as quiet as a pin drop in this public restroom I call out does anyone have a diaper hoping that some gentleman was changing a baby nothing no one said a word I know people are in here I can see the toes of shoes pointed in my direction under the stall does anyone have a diaper I am screaming my son is now crying he thinks he is witnessing the death of his father I can't even assure him that I will make it and let's see yes he is like really good writing yeah I think in their little sensational they get sensational but people actually experience this stuff um this ruined my life from gummy poo um I see is that the beginning of this cuz we kind of wrote this up in a weird way it is and this is not the entire thing this is just an excerpt of his right without gummy poo from gummy poo with no other option I ran back towards the bathroom trying to keep my cheeks clenched little staccato bursts of sulfuric farts punctuated each yard as I raced for the finish line hoping that I could keep my chocolate starfish clenched tight enough to steal the donuts that's too much information I mean you've nicknamed it I ripped it really I ripped the door open and somehow managed to drop my pants without undoing my belt whatever that sounded like a steamroller driving through a bubble wrap you know what we should study these it's true does anybody want any uh you know what I uh I hate to a handful no don't yeah we're not gonna document okay alright you want to read a couple more I have here no if it gets any worse than that I just feel like I thought about my car and how I complete an unforgiving fire would be the only way to cleanse it gonna burn himself his car he's gonna burn his car okay well would we learn a day till my wife I loved her Haribo I hold no ill will I blame no one I have even forgiven myself is there a Gibson for giving myself okay I think we've learned that I am so sorry mrs. teacher's name I was never asked to send snacks to my daughter's class again oh I do want to find out where did you get those cupcakes from place on Magnolia so Magnolia I like him so much really sugar free sugar free cupcake I'm going I like those those are good um so ro uh we ate a lot of stuff on your channel too but I don't know that you expected us to eat everything at every point in the process of making the recipe but you dealt with it pretty well yeah um I couldn't help but notice that you weren't eating any of like the cake batter the cake batter or this when we do test baking we'd test bake in like different sections and the day before I usually eat about 4 to 5 cupcakes so I try to control it quality control cuz I have a sweet tooth so right right I go crazy about once a week during the test baking and then I try to control it there were the rest of the week but do you like um like I was I was telling you I have a weakness for cake batter or anything that's like raw sweets or like undercooked like cookie dough cookie batter brownie batter like once you bake that stuff I I could care less I'd rather have a rib and that's a disorder it yeah I'd rather have meat and man if you go to cook that batter you might as well just give me meat I like them both I like steaks and I like sweet so I don't do that you don't Duras I do I like cookie cake better not as much as cookie dough cookie dough's my favorite cookie dough ice cream gets me in trouble I can't be around it or I'll eat all of it I went to the farmers market here in Los Angeles mm-hmm and they were there was a guy selling cake batter in cups and cookie dough in cups and all the raw stuff but he made them without eggs so no one would die so no one would die that's cool but technically was social you're not gonna get Salmonella from we've been through this raw eggs in America you can eat all the raw eggs you want just like rocky drink them for breakfast yeah mm-hmm yeah I know people who do sampled eggs every morning but those are cooked what those are good this isn't really relatable but I just like I mean maybe there's a part of it that's under coach they don't have to because I do sunny side up what's your favorite dessert like if you had only one dessert the rest of your life having made so many stuffs my current favorite sure macaroons was all fancy French cookies delicious how many ones that are kind of I don't get better I don't get them they're kind of crispy mm-hmm they're like soft and fluffy on the area hide crispy on the outside they come in different flavors but my sweet tooth changes a lot because I do eat a lot of sweets I also love donuts maple donuts maple bars okay you should put pork rinds on one going seriously hot news flash I'm I'm experiencing a symptom right now but centum of what well in the back of my throat like the flap between the top of my throat and leading into my nasal passage is burning like like sugar alcohol or something I don't know what it is I feel fine it's like I think I have a sugarfree gummy bear lodged back there oh well I use the backside of that lollipop to get it out we'll cut the camera off and then you can work that out really I'm not feeling good guys I have my FPS out ha ha ha well I think we're done you you",

are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "RGSpXJxvwvE": "[Music] raspberry flavorless [Music] [Music] juice

largemouth bass ever neighbor Rick with us today and of course out here with my dad we are on the boat we are largemouth fishing and this is the very first gummy worm fishing challenge ever check out the bait lineup we have horrible part about I say snakes we are using nothing but gummy worms in this morning it is summertime so it gets very hot we're only in a fish probably till about 11:00 or so look these are stuck together you know I'm actually gonna leave them stuck together okay that's just the way they come they literally they come to snakes oh I just put bones okay well they come to snakes stuck together do you want to use them yes archers that's actually a perfect color and then we have here this is I've never seen this is called the all-star mix trolley they have little people I guess we'll get to that in a second that's kind of a weird color we have octopus check out that that is gonna come in fact I'm gonna set that guy that is a special one we're gonna set that onto the site we have let's see where's a long I know we have llamas name there we go we got a llama Roland a llama might come into play and the other one I'm most confident about out of all of them simply because we've caught trout I've never caught a bass on the gummy new Breton lure but we have caught trout on these before and this is actually what I'll start off with is a nice a little gummy worm their first ever gummy fishing challenge so I'm just gonna rig this gummy worm just like you would any other plastic bait just Texas rig got a paid one eight ounce sinker well fishing pretty shallow water you don't need a lot of weight paint sinker and there you go guys and so we have a Texas rig gummy worm right there black forced everyone let's see how this works guys I got one I got one on a gummy worm yes on a gummy worm Oh literally it's huge - look at that it's huge it's huge it's a tank are you kidding me look at you grab it don't worry about that don't worry about that just oh my goodness no look the gummy worm fell off must have fallen off in the fight it's not it's kind of brittle holy heck that's like the biggest large oh they cut all year on this lake is crazy guys like the second cast of the day big budget guys unfortunately our scale or our yeah our scale is not it's out the batteries aren't working but this isn't almost 20 inch largemouth good grief this is probably solid 4 pounder probably yeah the Willie go-go board hasn't put it over 4 pounds that is a my biggest this is guys this is the biggest bass of the year for me right here on a gummy where that is crazy the second it was either the second or third cast of the day my biggest pass of the year on a gummy worm I thought at the start of this day if I catch one fish something gummy I'll be super happy and so that's just that's amazing so I'm not taking anything for granted let's see if we can get another fish on this you know guys I had planned on using some of these octopus and stuff next and I will I want to see if I can get another one I'm just the regular gummy worm red and green there we go let's give it a go these octopus and llamas and snakes they'll come into play later oh you had one fallen oh my dad just had one follow up on his uh his gummy this is funny here have been wasting money on five dollar packs of baits and I could have been I could have in a dollar bag of gummy worms yeah they'd be fighting as a fishin troll tournament with nothing but gommi guys I'm gonna switch up to an orange and yellow one they kind of come off the hook easily so we might go through this bag pretty fast like that so maybe it's like something unusual they've never seen and it smells different than anything they've ever seen and so who knows and I'm not trying to jinx the day just cuz we caught one but we'll see if we catch more but that's another theory and all the parties I think it came up just all right guys check it out I'm switching to a little you know I'm it makes the kind of Carolina rig a little bit this octopus see if we catch someone and gummy octopus let's see if the llama turns things around not even hook a llama and hook the llama through the foot and then put the hook point in his head there we go that'll be good action in the water oh I missed him I did on the llama that was he started take off with it dang it grabbed the llama pulled him off almost pulled him off the hook they call this one Cusco my dad has a tough morning efficient besides it's been good for me but with my gummy worms I wouldn't say that turned our day around no no but it got the money got the monkey off my back a little larger ah nice got one annika me where he snagged he snagged though oh my line is tangled I was wondering what was I can still feel him on there he's still on look there you serious oh that was that was crazy got snagged I thought here's what I think so these baths are just used to eating protein all day and they see that little sweet snack I know they've never seen anything like it before Wow guys ii gummy worm a fish ever another another like solid I've switched back to like I'll show you guys what I switch to they caught this one on a different I've been trying just like every gummy worm in the pack that one on the Black Forest ones but this time it was an orange and yellow gummy worm I've been throwing everything dinosaurs everything we got snakes and this is tell you what maybe it's a finessed and I'd say maybe the sugars coming off of that thing because it's kind of melting in this warm water each worm only lasts about 5 or 10 minutes but maybe that's the key to it at 2:00 today well guys I'm happy that I caught - I can't believe they cut - do you did on gummy worms but the gummy worms as you can see you're starting to just fall apart fall off the hook the fish bone apart easily well guys if you enjoyed this video preached plus the like on it and we'll do another gummy worm challenge and it differently hopefully on a day when it a little bit better then you guys so much for watching I'll see you guys the next one [Music] [Music]", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how

help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "PsFkaw2CAnQ": "- This is our pizza.

Personally, it's actually really hard. I think I would actually rather\na hot dog, is that weird? Unless it's a chicken burger. If it's a chicken or a\nturkey burger, I will do it. But I'm just not really into beef. I'm not into beef, I don't\nknow what it is about it. And our refreshment of choice is The Coldest, Coldest,\nColdest Water Bottle.

I swear I am a 12 year\nold at heart, honestly. This is our pizza. Look, it has like olives right there. I guess some sort of spaghetti on it, I don't know why there's that, but. Should I eat it like that? I'm just gonna set this down. Alright, so whatever this\nis, or supposed to be. Let's eat it. Okay, let's have some olives. There's like a little orange, but it's probably supposed to\nbe like a pepper or something, or I don't know. Maybe an onion. This is supposed to be a pepper. Okay, so now let's build our little pizza. So here's our pizza, we have a teddy bear on there. Put the olive, okay. We have something else, I\ndon't know what this is, but put it on there.

Goodnight.", "ciGTwzOgnmw": "my car oh well if you buy them from the store if you get the healthy ones they can be really expensive because the thing is a lot of them are filled with additives that fill with dyes synthetic ingredients a loved one from the health food stores no we're talking I'm talking regular ones when you make your own you control what's in them and if you buy these very healthy ones super expensive yeah I'm going to show you how to make them well let's show show us how miss Barrett what do we often as well that is okay that really do that is it's such an easy recipe that's what I love about it look how pretty they are as well pretty so what you need is you're going to use fruit juice organic fruit juice not juice from concentrate and the reason is because you want it to be really strong okay have a lot of taste what is this one this one is elder berry and I like to use a juice that has added health benefits and elderberry is very good for your immune system right then we have gelatin if you're vegan you can use agar agar flakes that is a sea vegetable is a wonderful option for a vegan or a vegetarian you have honey and then you have the vitamins that you're going to use you can customize use which are the vitamins you want today I'm using vitamin C powder you could do a be even a probiotic okay all right so that's it how do we make these well I actually made a few earlier so just let's roll in the tape oh look at those so what I did was I put the juice in a little saucepan like so then I sprinkled on the gelatin and here's the really fun part now is that I whisk the gelatin in and then I left it for a while to see it blue it blooms which means that it absorbs all of the liquid then I put it on the heat and it started to liquefy so you want it to break up and to completely liquefy then I'm adding some nice raw honey to it and then finally I'm putting in powdered vitamin C or vitamin C loading it up there and then whisk it again make sure there are no lumps in it spray really important to chocolate mold or a candy mold I use that doesn't stick right exactly then I used a turkey baster just to add it into the little candy molds and then I am going to let it set for just a couple of hours in the fridge and we are done and what we actually have here is the little set ones and you may try one if you like right there mark what if they don't come out of the mold so mark they do they do come out of the molds really do all right you can control the amount I have my determine C for the day you've got your vitamin C for the day work do what if you don't have one of these all right so if you don't have your moulds it's so easy you can just use a glass pyrex dish that you have at home I have pre-made some here in a little saucepan I am simply going to actually would you spray first this is very important as well not be able to get it out of the bowl see that does it come out of the mold Oh mark you're just so she's doing that will you and then in that goes like so and then you're going to leave that to set in the frigid air and when you are done here I'll take this over boom oh thank you mom another wave right here we have set one now hang on a minute what if it doesn't come out of the mold me what if it doesn't come out of the mold okay what do you like to cut it for you to cut it into little cubes hey drop some numbers over here what's this cost all right in the store it's upwards of 20 bucks for third for a month's supply for a month's supply $2 Wow this is why it makes sense save yourself a money

juicy bears they have juicy burst centers these are mixed fruit flavored gummy candies they were 250 at kroger and the sign on the display says that these are thick so it doesn't say that on the bag but it was on the display so they're in a resellable bag there are four flavors so that's that's everything in the bag so if you want to pick out four flavors um pick out red pink green punch uh what am i missing i don't know dark red light red i don't see a where is another light one is that a white one that looks exactly the same as that one maybe i'd need a dark red that's what i needed a dark red okay they say fat-free gluten-free colors from real sources eight pieces is 100 calories four fruity flavors we have cherry apple strawberry and pineapple these soft and delicious gummies are so juicy and so good that's because they have a delicious juicy burst center that's made with real fruit juice and colors from real sources they're also fat free and come in a variety of great fruity flavors so try our juicy gummies and delight in the magic of black forest these are manufactured by ferreira uh candy company in chicago yes they do so do you want to do uh uh cherry let's do strawberry i think it's gonna be the light one um a little liquid in there definitely strawberry it's more of a natural strawberry i love the texture of these they're very soft and a little chewy and if you wanted to you could make these last a while of course we're biting right into them because we want to try them for you but yeah these would be make great movie theater candy they will let's do the cherry except they're sticky good cherry flavor these do taste natural compared to like is it betty crocker that sells a lot of these like they'll sell trolls and yeah trolls and cars and all those i think that's betty crocker brand these do taste more natural you don't have fruit snacks or fruits fruit snacks yeah yeah i don't eat fruit snacks i don't know um these taste very very natural the ones you get in the little pockets yeah now i'm gonna go gummies and gummies these definitely taste more natural than a gummy yeah well oh yeah so i should be okay i see what you're saying so i should be comparing these to like albany okay and i'm thinking okay and i'm okay i'm literally thinking of fruit snacks okay well um because they do remind you of a fruit snack because they are so natural yes because they taste they taste more comparable to a fruit snack than they do to an all even the textures are very similar yeah yeah that's the truth then we have pineapple you really taste pineapple it's strong it's good flavor and again the textures are really good and they do give you enough of the liquid center to know that it's there yeah yeah it's not like full of liquid but there isn't there's a little touch of it this one's apple well i'm thinking like gushers that has the for the uh liquid in the middle the apple was okay that's probably my least favorite one awesome to me the flavor come at the very end yeah you got a little bit of apple yeah the apple you had to chew it for a minute and then you got it at the very end and like i said of course you could make these last for a while um i really really like these they're different than a gummy bear because the gummy bears is very chewy and almost rubbery these aren't like that these are more comparable to like a fruit snack they're they've got a little chew to them but they're hopefully they're softer so ultimately it's just a matter if you want a more candy flavor then you would want to buy like the albany yes but if you want a more natural flavor then you could buy this but they're good yeah i really do like these though i think kids will love them uh so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "R3cb8GGbG3U": "Wait 'til we get back, okay? Bye. Bye. Bye-Bye. Bye-Bye. (gasp). (laughs). Do you have fruit snacks in your hand? Is that what I see? (laughs) Did you eat any? (laughs)", "1ZFWCKptfyw": "[Music] hi welcome to diving delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and the regular guys welcome back so today I am going to do a very quick video for you guys on how to do tincture since I've kind of moved over to tincture using it for can't sugars and syrups and flowers and so on and so forth so for those of you who don't know how to make tincture there's two ways of you can do it there's the old-fashioned way of using a mason jar and your plant material and your vodka or if you've got one of these handy-dandy puppies the magic butter machine or another type of machine like that that does infusion or that does t-shirts then you're much better off to go this way so this method takes four to six week or sorry six to eight weeks and this takes four hours so if this is something that you want to do just as a one-time do you can go ahead and try that but it tinctures is something that you get into for your edibles on a regular basis I highly highly recommend trying to get one of these things it's gonna save you so much time and effort and yeah so that's it for that so I'm just gonna get right into it there's not a whole lot here we're talking vodka a jar or the machine and the biggest thing is your alcohol so for your alcohol mainly vodka is the best one now you need to make sure that it is at least a 100 151-proof or at least seventy-six percent or higher in the States you can get Everclear which I believe is around a ninety four ninety six percent in Ontario or and I don't know about the rest of Canada however in Ontario if you can find spiritus this is 76 percent you can buy it off the shelf if not we have what's called alcohol that is ninety four percent however you have to contact the LCBO the I don't know what was it I'll put the link in for you just to make it helpful quality control that's it you have to send them a request as to exactly what you want to use it for how much you want to use it a year and if they agreed then they'll send you a letter and you take that to the LCBO and while off they will give you the the alcohol alcohol so or it come back way easier get right off the shelf and so that's about it this is more than the difficulty is getting the higher percent alcohol now a trick for you if you cannot obtain the 76 percent alcohol you can do the oldest method of distillation so get your 40 percent alcohol put it in the freezer wait till the water that's all completely frozen once it's frozen you will take it out and put it over a strainer and and you just take the lid off because the alcohol does not freeze it will work its way through the ice and drip out and that is going to almost double your percentage in your alcohol by taking out that water that is the oldest method of distillation is freezing so there you go or an easy trip an easy trick for you then you can do the second time to increase it even more so that I said waited should do it if it is difficult so I'm gonna just back up the camera a little bit here for you so we can see everything and show you how to put that together alright so to do a t-shirt now you can do a tincture for any type of plant materials so this goes for your herb if you want to do rose petals so if you've got a garden and you do all kinds of herbs you can do this is the exact same way that you would do those type of textures as well if you're into herbalism and things like that this is that exactly the same way you would do it so you are going to first of all deke are pure plant material if you don't know what the garbage decarboxylation which is converting your THC a to THC you do that by putting it in the oven in a glass oven safe pan or contain here hold on one sec something like this hourglass food would be better for you if not covered with tinfoil and you put it in the oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and then you take it out and let it completely cool to room temperature once you've got that you will place it into a mason jar if you were doing it the old-fashioned way you will pour I've got three cups here of my 76 percent spiritus alcohol shoot well hopefully your partner is not all over your counter that's it you will place your lid on for a minute and you're gonna give it a good shake then you're gonna place it in your cupboard in a dark cupboard for the next six to eight weeks and every day every once or twice a day a couple times two or three times a day whenever you happen to go into your kitchen take her out give her a good shake up put her back in the dark and I said about six to eight weeks later that tincture will be ready you will strain that material out and you're good to go now if you're doing it with the herbal magic holy mackerel the magic of butter machine sorry if you're doing it with the magical butter machine the magical butter calm it's just a simple it's actually simpler you will take everything now you have to do at least a minimum of two cups to a maximum of five cups so I am just gonna take this because I'm not doing the six to eight week method and we just pour it right into our magical butter [Music] let's go scrape the rest of that out well it's easier said than done just give that a little bit of a stir up there put your lid on Luger in and you are going to set the temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit or I can't see what it says in the cells if he says 94 Celsius and you are going to set it for the four-hour t-shirt that's it lights are gonna come on it's gonna do the grinding in that and after four hours we are going to strain this and that's it we'll have our texture so a lot of great reasons as I said we're making tincture is that you can make so much from your tincture as I said you can do the can of sugar check out my video on how to make kin of sugar there's the other one on canna flour powdered sugar Cantus syrup and simple syrup how to cover those so you can pretty much make all your base ingredients now with your tincture and it shows you how to do it to dehydrate it so it evaporates all the alcohol leaving your good stuff and you can then use all these ingredients then for your base cooking so you're no longer having to put butter in two places butter has no business being like jello so I'm pretty sure we could get a million recipes enough one of those recipes is going to call for butter so that now lets you eliminate the most of fires and things and lets you make things more in their natural state as well as being able to better control how strong or weak you want to make your products so you can either just use a little bit of sugar so 1/4 because sofa for example if a recipe is 1 cup you can either use a quarter cup it would be pretty mild or you can use a whole cup of can if you really wanted to render people unconscious so it's that it gives you far more versatility than using the butter or the oil you're going to get the same type of strength and yeah I definitely love using that I have a lot more oh and one thing also when you are if you are using the machine I always make sure to either have a fan if there overhead fan going or Stan fan or have the window open you want to always have air circulation whenever you're working with alcohol especially alcohol that is so highly concentrated all right and one other thing that I know a lot of you are gonna ask me which I probably should have said earlier about the D card would I would de carbon so generally on average people again it's all how personally strong you want to make your base your t-shirt so I've included the a link for a calculator so you can calculate your own but my route what I generally do is a half an ounce to one cup or one pound of butter so that's generally my rule of thumb of how the strength that I like to make mine as I said use the calculator and then you can figure out exactly how much you want to add of your plant material in order to get the strength of the dosing etc of exactly what you aren't personally and so once your your texture is done if you're using the machine after four hours you can then just strain it well with your handy this bag is awesome if you guys have this machine you know this bag is almost worth but getting it for the machine so yeah just straight around if not if you've got if you're doing it HR method then you will strain it you can use a strainer and a cheesecloth or a coffee coffee filter and for those of you who don't know what a cheesecloth is it is a fine fine mesh cotton cloth that you double and triple up to to get it as fine as you want it to and they're awesome for straining you can get them in any grocery store any dollar store they're really easy you easily two pot they're very easy to find story and yeah does it said and they're really inexpensive they're like a dollar and they're huge and you can just use whatever size you want but so that's it once you're done you will you will store it in a mason jar secure the lid on tight and keep it in a dark location and that's it for textures alright so my infusion is now done they got the lid pour it through this handy-dandy strainer just gonna get out of the extra pulp maybe squeeze around forever dropping things pour back into your clean mason jar on it and that's it you store it in a in your cupboard in a dark in a dark cover so this needs to stay at a direct sunlight that's very important otherwise it will deteriorate everything and that's it for tincture easy as pie so I hope you enjoyed that little demonstration there for you and again as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and you guys are awesome this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribe or at least just check out some of those other videos and I think that's all I've got for you so I have hope you have an awesome rest of your day thanks again for watching bye [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all

INVENTED\nIN THE LATE THE 20th CENTURY BY A COUPLE\nLOOKING FOR A WAY TO ENTICE THEIR DAUGHTER\nTO TAKE HER VITAMINS. INFUSED INTO A GUMMY CANDY, VITAMINS ARE NOW A SWEET\nAND CHEWY EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH KIDS AND ADULTS. \u266a\u266a JUST LIKE GUMMY CANDIES, GUMMY VITAMINS COME IN A VARIETY\nOF SWEET, FRUITY FLAVORS, MAKING A VITAMIN\nA LESS BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW. EACH GUMMY VITAMIN STARTS\nWITH A SPECIFIC FORMULA. FIRST, RAW INGREDIENTS ARE\nSELECTED AND WEIGHED. SOME ARE IN LIQUID FORM\nAND OTHERS ARE SOLIDS. THE NUTRITIONAL INGREDIENTS\nARE BLENDED WITH WATER. THIS PARTICULAR BATCH IS\nA MULTIVITAMIN PREPARATION. IT INCLUDES MAGNESIUM,\nCALCIUM, AND OTHER MINERALS. \u266a\u266a IN A SEPARATE TANK, TECHNICIANS\nPREPARE THE GELATIN BASE WHICH GIVES THE VITAMINS\nA JELLY-LIKE CONSISTENCY. NEXT, SUGAR AND GELATIN PRE-MIX\nIS POURED INTO THE TANK. \u266a\u266a THE TECHNICIAN\nADDS A SUGAR SUBSTITUTE TO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. MEANWHILE, SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF\nWATER AND GLUCOSE ARE DISPENSED INTO THE TANK. \u266a\u266a IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO BLEND THE INGREDIENTS\nFOR THE GELATIN BASE. THEN, THE GUMMY VITAMIN BASE IS TRANSFERRED TO\nA LARGE HOLDING TANK. IN THE LAB, THE NUTRITIONAL\nMIXTURE IS TESTED FOR CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS\nHEAVY METALS AND BACTERIA. AN AUTOMATED SYRINGE INJECTS\nTHE SOLUTIONS INTO TEST TUBES, RINSING IN BETWEEN INJECTIONS. NOW THE SAMPLES IN THE TEST\nTUBES ARE READY TO BE ANALYZED. FOR HEAVY METAL TESTING, THE SAMPLE IS INJECTED INTO AN\nEXTREMELY HOT VACUUM CHAMBER. THE PLASMA FLAME TURNS THE METAL\nCONTAMINANTS INTO ATOMS, WHICH THE MACHINE\nREADS AS DIFFERENT COLORS. THE MACHINE ALSO IDENTIFIES\nAND QUANTIFIES CONTAMINANTS. WITH THE SAMPLES\nCLEARED FOR PROCESSING, THEY'RE READY\nFOR FLAVORING AND COLORANT. MORE VITAMINS ARE ADDED\nIN POWDER FORM TO BOOST THE FORMULA'S POTENCY. THE LIQUID VITAMIN PREPARATION\nAND THE GELATIN BASE IS PIPED INTO THE MIXING TANK. THEN, EVERYTHING\nIS BLENDED TOGETHER. THE BATTER IS NOW READY\nTO BE MADE INTO THOUSANDS OF GUMMY\nVITAMINS. A CONVEYOR QUEUES UP\nTHE VITAMIN MOLDS. MULTIPLE NOZZLES DEPOSIT\nPRECISE AMOUNTS OF BATTER INTO SMALL MOLDS. THE CONVEYOR MOVES\nTHE TRAY FORWARD AS THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nBEGIN TO SOLIDIFY. A ROBOTIC ARM STACKS THE MOLD\nTRAYS IN A HOLDING AREA. THE ARM GENTLY LOWERS\nTHE TRAYS INTO PLACE. FOR SEVERAL HOURS, THE PILLS CONTINUE TO\nHARDEN IN THE MOLDS. ONCE COMPLETELY SOLIDIFIED, THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nARE REMOVED FROM THE MOLDS AND TRANSFERRED\nINTO A REVOLVING DRUM. THE TUMBLE IN\nTHE DRUM SEPARATES THEM. THEY EXIT ONTO\nA PERFORATED CONVEYOR, AND ANY SMALL BITS\nFALL THROUGH THE HOLES. THE CONVEYOR ZIGZAGS\nBACK AND FORTH, ALLOWING THE GUMMY VITAMINS\nTO COOL AND FURTHER SOLIDIFY. THE GUMMY VITAMINS HAVE NOW\nREACHED THEIR FINAL CONSISTENCY. THE GUMMY VITAMINS HEAD INTO\nA STEAM CHAMBER. THE HUMIDITY FROM THE STEAM PREPS THE VITAMINS\nFOR SUGARCOATING. THE SUGAR CLINGS TO\nTHE GUMMY VITAMINS. AND THE REVOLVING ACTION OF\nTHE DRUM SHAKES OFF ANY EXCESS, LEAVING JUST A DUSTING\nON THE SURFACE. AT THE PACKAGING STATION,\nTHE VITAMINS FUNNEL INTO CHUTES WHERE SENSORS COUNT AND RELEASE\nTHE PILLS INTO BOTTLES. AS THE BOTTLES MOVE FORWARD,\nCAPS LAND ON THE RIMS. AND SPINNING RUBBER MECHANISMS\nSCREW THE CAPS ON TIGHTLY. DOWN THE LINE,\nLABELS WITH PRODUCT INFORMATION ARE PLACED ONTO EACH BOTTLE. DEPENDING ON THE FORMULATION,\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO THREE WEEKS TO PRODUCE GUMMY VITAMIN PILLS. AND THE RESULT? NUTRITIOUS GUMDROPS\nTHAT ARE A REAL TREAT.", "XwDbtYweiVk": "you're watching B TV welcome back to B TV a year ago this next company was number 12 in its category today they're number one by a wide margin in the cannabis edibles market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints and with the acquisition of good co-op will be selling baked goods also made with love [Music]", "qHUlHZ21XK0": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to quarantine chemistry today we're going to be using gummy bears and we're going to be seeing if we can increase or decrease their size really simple one all you're going to need is two glasses three gummy bears some salt 200 min of water and a spoon just okay so what we're going to do I'm going to get my two blasters there I'm going to pour 100 ml of water in each of them perfect okay so now the second step is that you're going to add a teaspoon of salt to one of the glasses give it a good mix the next thing you need to do is you need to measure the width and the length of each gummy bear so I've got three different colors here I've got yellow red and green and two so we can tell which one is which and I will put the yellow one in the salt solution I've got the red one in the water solution and the green one will be my control by in order to tell whether they increase or decrease in size we need to measure them start off with okay now that we've measured them we can just simply add our gummy bears into our solutions so I'm going to put my yellow one in my sought solution my red one into my water solution and then our green one can just act as a control so this one will just be left as is so we need to leave this for approximately 24 hours before we see any increase or decrease in size so we're going to require a little bit of patience there and but good news is you've probably got a whole pack of gummy bears that you can go any so over the next two hours you can observe the glowing bears but don't take them out of the water that's pretty important that you leave them in the water until the 24 hours is up okay so it's 24 hours later and it's time to check up on our gummi bears first of all you can see that there are some obvious size differences between the control and the one left in water and so water now we are going to carefully take the gummy bear that has been left in water for 24 hours out of the water using a spoon and I'm just going to place it on the paper next to our control now I'm going to do the same for the gummy bear that's been left in salt water for 24 hours you okay so we managed to increase the size of our gummy bear that was left in water for 24 hours but almost double the size and our gummy bear that was left in saltwater we noticed that the color became a lot more concentrated now this week I'm challenging you to recreate this experiment at home and you don't have to just use water and salt water like I tested you can test a variety of different liquids that you can find at the kitchen and don't forget if you can't recreate the experiment I oven you can still get involved by entering of explanation of the science behind the experiment the key word that I would like you to include in your explanation for this week is osmosis so can you use that word to explain why a gummy bear left in water increased in size and the color of the gummy bear left and saltwater became a lot more concentrated get your entries of your explanations in by the end of the week along with photos and videos of you carrying out the experiment at home I can't wait to see how inventive you get with the different liquids that you test your gummy bears in and I hope you have lots of fun doing it", "vUNWbXCRmvc": "easy do [Music] you",

what's up everybody it's biggy welcome to the vlog again I hope you guys had a awesome New Year's I know some people probably feel like [ __ ] today I only had a couple drinks last night so I feel great I'm heading to the gym right now and do I believe some arms start off the year and a good a positive vibe at the gym with a little arm day action who doesn't appreciate a little arm day I really wanted to do something today trying to make like a trip down to Ikea maybe get some new office stuff some like additional minor things that I need to get to help build the office setup which again I'm sorry that it's taking so long to update you guys on the office and get you guys an actual full tour of the office but it's not done yet and I don't want to have asset like I said I want it to be a dope office setup tour a dope like gaming workstation streaming just an all in one place that I can uh that I can show off to you all and brag a little bit with it's not ready it doesn't look like the gym is actually that bad today I figured first of the year that there might be a lot of people here although that's annoying although it's like yeah it's annoying to have the gym be super packed and stuff I do want to remind people my friend Rob actually put out a good video on that just because people are coming to the gym and [ __ ] and some of them don't know what they're doing I know some of it can be funny sometimes and again I know that this can get annoying you know having a lot of people here and maybe they'll take up your parking spots just have some [ __ ] respect man like these people are just trying to better themselves and they're using a new year and a resolution to to help that and yeah in a couple weeks to a month maybe the gym might clear out but some of these people if you actually like support them and to help them out if they if they're confused about something and don't be a dick about [ __ ] some of these people are actually going to follow through with their resolution just because some people give up doesn't mean that everybody does I relate big time I was that guy that was like scared to go to the gym and work out because I was worried about other people making fun of me or what other people thought and slightly don't be a dick it's pretty simple don't be a dick why are you gonna make gummy bears more often now that's made out of T in its wheat without it being real sugar they're not done yet but they're definitely better consistency their money they're so Megan's gonna start making gummy bears apparently and they're like healthy gummy bears so she bought a whole bunch of these little little trays little gummy bear trays water we can start making like we could start making acid ones and sell them oh yeah we could make G field one soup of course but we can start making acid ones or likes somewhat sluicin Ingenix in it and start selling them no Jesus Christ so I've gone over some my goals for the year what I want to achieve in 2019 major ones are the losing 50 pounds hitting the goal of 200 the daily objective is managing my day better financially getting out of debt and just you know progressing as a person and mentally and physically progressing you know that the health was continuing eating better that's one thing I really do feel like 2018 that I did progress actually really well was eating a lot better I really moved into the keto and paleo lifestyle and I didn't do it in the sense of just trying to achieve weight loss route you know actually trying to just feel better just I don't know get more out of my food you know they may just get more out of what I consume on a daily basis so I figured one thing that would be cool is just to kind of see what you guys want to do this year what do you guys want achieve this year what kind of resolution do you guys want to set forward in 2019 what do you want to change about yourself this year what could you say in the comments or on Twitter or an Instagram in relation with us that could hold you accountable if you guys aren't following me on Twitter if you're not following me on Instagram I do post like daily on just updates on everything that I do you know so that way if you don't see much of the vlog you can come by there and check out the stuff there what is you guys want to accomplish issues what is it that you want to change about yourselves I really do want to know like I mentioned one of the coolest things about 2018 was like getting to know you guys and I feel like a lot of you guys and gals do have objectives you do have goals I feel like maybe if you even present it to us myself in the comments or on social media and the people alongside the community that we're building maybe you too will follow that kind of like feeling that I'm feeling with the vlogs and everything and just sharing everything about streaming and sharing my life on social media that says the feeling of being held accountable you know so please in the comments down below what are you guys's goals and ambitions this year you know don't be shy don't feel that your goal is any less than somebody else's because it's like not a weight loss or a money goal like what do you guys want to get done this year I know a monthly goal right now my objectives in the first month of the year cuz I do want to start breaking down things a lot more is when I get two out of the four weddings that I'm working on out of the way so that way it gives me a few months to work on the last few or a couple months to work on the last two hopefully I get my camera back this month right now I'm recording on the sony a7s 200 play I get stuff done around the office get the setup done overall everybody I just want to let you all know that no matter what kind of goals that you have no matter where you're starting off right now it may seem cheesy well I want you guys to understand that there's there's no difference between a lot of us like you really can set out and get those goals this year if you want to have a lot of goals and ambition on streaming charts streaming and get the [ __ ] done like do it cuz you will get a result if you want to start creating YouTube videos if you want to start designing if you want to start working out through what other people think even if they are making fun of you or we're not supporting you in some way realistically I can just tell you from experience that in a lot of situations most people out there just don't care like I said we are our own worst enemy when I first started going to the gym I was really nervous as I was afraid of how people would start looking at me you know cuz I'm overweight I'm in I don't really know what I'm doing it I super realize like nobody cares like nobody gives a [ __ ] they're there to better themselves like real people are everyone might have an [ __ ] every now and then but don't let those people stop you from working at bettering yourself 100% you can hit your 2019 let me know what they are on the comments down below let me know what what you want to hit what day and please if you also see somebody else commenting on like a goal or something that maybe it's not similar to something that you did it's you shirt respond back to those people give them some encouragement like let's let's get this [ __ ] this year dude let's work for some [ __ ] get some stuff done maybe actually get a setup video going it's all got for you guys today I'm out peace [Music] [Laughter] [Music]", "8cWP1sf1taA": "what's going on you guys welcome back to a new video today we're going to be filming a very fun challenge today i'm going to be eating gummy food for 24 hours although i'm very excited i'm also low-key scared because eating candy for 24 hours doesn't sound like a good idea but if you're excited for this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up also subscribe to the channel my goal for 2021 is to get our channel yes our channel because this is my channel and your channel as well to 2 million and i know we can make it happen because we are a strong family while you're at it don't forget to hit the bell so i can notify you every single time that i post a

for breakfast so you are having a waffle an egg and bacon okay okay yo this smells just like a waffle let's see what this tastes like we're gonna take our fork let's try to cut our waffle this is a little rubbery no yeah that's not working okay we're just gonna go in with our hands we're just gonna bite it okay this actually tastes like a waffle like i'm getting like maple waffle vibes this is really good i'm going to try the egg now dude you're going to break a teeth mmm this one is so good that one doesn't taste like egg but it's really good mm-hmm i think i like this one better than the waffle one okay the bacon though i'm excited for this one this one smells like cherry mmm it's okay i'm gonna try it this and the egg have to be my favorite ones this is really really good i'm gonna sit here enjoy my breakfast and then i'll see you guys in a little bit because we actually have to head out to the store and get a snack so we'll see what we end up getting for a snack so i'll see you guys in a bit five minutes later okay guys we just got here to the mall and i came to my favorite candy store they always have a lot of good candy so i'm really hoping that we can find a big variety of gummies and then i'm able to find a snack so let's go to the store [Applause] [Music] bish i literally found everything that i needed we walked in the store and we were like jackpot i found everything for lunch snack at dinner i can't wait to show you guys everything that we picked up one thing that i did get was this gummy bear which is the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear if this video gets at 20 000 likes i will try it in my next asmr so give this video a thumbs up and now let's see what i end up having for my snack for our snack we're going to be having this a gummy pickle with real pickle taste so let's see what this tastes like i'm kind of nervous because i love pickles but just like the thought of like real pickle taste on a gummy i don't know about that okay let's check it out it smells like oh my god i was gonna say it smells like green apple but i can literally smell the pickle now oh i don't know this is gonna be good okay let's try it out oh my god it's so bad so disgusting this is no for me this is i cannot even swallow this it's like sweet and then you get like the actual flavor of the pickle this is a no-go for me so i will see you guys in a couple hours for lunch time hopefully for lunch time we have better luck than our snacks two hours later okay guys it's been a couple hours and now it is time for lunch my stomach is growling and it's also hurting a little bit i don't know if it's because i'm hungry or if it's because all this candy is starting to get to me but either way it's lunch time so i do want to eat so cameraman what do we have for lunch oh you have pizza a hot dog a cheeseburger and a coke okay so for 2021 i was like you know what i'm gonna eat healthy but i guess 2021 had other plans for me and i mean i'm not married so let's try it so we do have some pizza with no veggies okay just the pepperoni and cheese awesome this is what it looks like oh it smells really good okay honestly after this video i think i'm gonna have to go to the dentist there's like so much tugging and they're so like hard to chew i'm just like you know but it's really good i can definitely taste this is like a strawberry flavor it's really good this is definitely vanilla and this is orange right here so this is not bad it's actually pretty good i'm really excited for this hot dog though look at this look at the detail we have the bun veggies the sausage and then we have the mustard and the ketchup now it's a little bit hard to take out just because it's not like a whole piece you do have to take it like one by one trying to pick it up can you let me see let's try this there we go so let's try it out what flavor is this that is so freaking good that is the best one that i've tried so far today now we're gonna try the cheeseburger there's lettuce the bun the meat the cheese and everything it's just it's really well made so let's give it a try do you guys want to take a bite now let me take a bite oh dang i don't need to go to the gym this was definitely a workout it's pretty good but it's not one of my favorite ones next thing that we're going to try is the gummy coke i am really excited for this one just because like i love the mini gummy ones that are like the coke flavor so this one i know it's going to be good so let's give it a try that sounded really painful it wasn't painful though it just sounded like you know it wasn't that bad mmm does it taste like the mini ones mm-hmm i have to say our lunch was very successful i cannot wait for dessert because i know dessert's gonna be extra sweet so i will see you guys in about 40 minutes to an hour so we can have dessert and then we're gonna have dinner so yeah i'll see you guys in a bit for dessert i have ice cream and i also have a donut they both look pretty good but i think the donut's gonna be better which one do you think's gonna taste better the donut looks pretty fine right i really like how it has like the chocolate detail and like even the sprinkles so i have the ice cream we're gonna try it out to see what it tastes like vanilla look i was expecting i was like this would be vanilla for sure it is vanilla i'm also going to try the little cone strawberry this one is the one that i'm really excited for oh not me ruining the chocolate i really want to try the chocolate so i'm going to give it a try it tastes just like chocolate really well that's good so the donut one has two layers i'm gonna try the strawberry one first this one it tastes just like the chocolate drizzle on top of the donut overall i really think that the donut one was my favorite one just because like i had a lot of different flavors going on versus like the ice cream cone so i have to say this one is my favorite one so i'm going to sit here and enjoy my dessert and then we'll see what we have for dinner it is time for our last meal of the day yay i'm lucky so happy because i'm like i'm ready for some real food i'm tired of candy honestly after this video i don't think i'm gonna have candy for a very very long time so for a dinner we're having a whole buffet we do have a sushi here we also have some noodles as well as a taco now fun fact i don't know if any of you guys know this but i have never ever ever in my life tried sushi like raw sushi my mom never let me eat sushi so this is the closest i'm ever gonna get to sushi so let's see let's try i'm guessing this is kind of like the soy sauce the details i know it's so cute i really like how they put like the detail in like the rose look at this i don't know what this is supposed to be because i'm not really into sushi let's try this one it's like a double roll me trying to use chopsticks and i don't even know how to use them these are some of my favorite candies but usually i get like the peach ones i have never tried the green ones what flavor is this oh this is apple i have never tried apple ones i usually always get like the peach ones but this is really good i also want to try this one because i think this one has like a marshmallow oh the marshmallow you have to try this that is good it's like so soft and chewy that one is pretty good that one is really good i also want to try the noodles you should try one of these let's try is it lemon i don't know what is it i don't think this has a flavor it sounds crunchy oh it tastes like perfume why does it taste like perfume i don't know oh yeah no i'm not a big fan of that one no let's try some noodles this is what i'm talking about also look at the detail of this it even comes with a little egg so let's try the noodles let's try to slap the noodles impossible i really want to try the little egg oh these what are these thinking it's like marshmallow it's really it has it's like coated in sugar it looks like a marshmallow reminds me of peeps it reminds me of the peeps that's banana flavor that's really good look at this taco i'm really sad this is cardboard i really wish that like they can make the shell like gummy i feel like that would have been awesome but look at everything that's inside you should try to bite everything at the same time these are really really tough to chew guys but i have to say my favorite ones that i tried from everything were these especially because of the marshmallow it was so good also the little green rings i have never tried apple flavor so that was my first time trying it as well of this so i guess kind of like the marshmallows were like my favorite ones just because they weren't like so tough on my teeth and i wasn't like yanking on them but overall i have to say today's video was pretty successful after this video i am not going to have any more gummy bears or anything that is gummy related i'm not going to be eating it for a while i am so glad that this challenge has come to an end because right now all i can think about is just in and out a real burger with some real fries and a real drink yes that is exactly what i deserve because i feel like i put meat in my stomach through a lot after this video so don't mind me guys i'm going to go get some real food because i am literally done with this gummy food all right guys that is the end of today's video thank god because i am so done eating all this gummy food for 24 hours i really hope you enjoyed today's video if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up remember if today's

"[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on

"what's up you guys it's khinkali here for another video why are you still wearing your seatbelt safety first we're not going anywhere take it off there you being a crazy diesel could be high for all we know they've done the drivers on the road alright what's up you guys it's kink alley here for another a new video so I got Jessica and Lizzie so if you want to are wearing the same outfits from the last video it's because I'm filming a couple of review videos in a row cuz they have you know quite a few products that I want to review some that are edibles and carts and flour and I want to go ahead and you know review as much as I can and put out as much content as we can today we're out just the three of us we're not going outside or anywhere we're just cruising around we're going through the hills and everywhere just kind of cruising we're not going into the parks or anything where anyone's hiking or anything we just wanted to pull over though and I'll insert some of where we drove through here but there's gonna be a vlog as well just kind of us talking and chillin and hanging out but I want to go ahead and get another review in so today we're actually gonna be reviewing another year another heavy hitters product but this time it's not gonna be a cartridge it's actually gonna be their edibles so we have my excuse my nails again I'm gonna get them done soon at home because I can't go anywhere what so we have their two edibles here so one is a cannabis infused gummy pineapple flavor five pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams we'll go ahead and get closer in super bright where I am I'm sorry you guys but does he just wanted to go out and be out where the Sun is and I'll do a closer up of this maybe in a second so the other one is cannabis infused got me strawberry 5 pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams here anything to kind of get the point of it perfect and then let me try to do the pineapple one more time just get a really good one of all right so we're gonna go ahead and review both of these for the flavor so let's go ahead and see so star burning fuse - 10 milligram servings per piece let's go ahead and read the back if there's anything so it says gluten-free dairy-free not free so gluten free dairy free not free super vegan I guess that's okay right it doesn't say specifically v4 like vegan or anything but it does say clean kind of is guaranteed let's see let's go ahead ten milligrams THC less than 2 milligrams CBD per piece it doesn't say specifically indica or sativa so most likely it's a hybrid that these gummies are so we're gonna go ahead and get into the strawberry ones here in this video you know go ahead and try one oh these are cute so they are rippable it um it's like a super soft like what is it called like a starburst if they put sugar around it but it's also soft like a gummy bear and it rips in half into two pieces but I'm just gonna go ahead and eat the whole piece as a 20 milligram so I'm gonna let her try it first and then I'm gonna give my thoughts on it so that way I don't say anything that like makes her change her thoughts on it so don't say anything but let me know when you once you have your thoughts in it okay so one first strawberry I think that they could have put in more like um maybe some citrus just for a little more punch and then just really a strawberry flavor there's no like to me it's like a very watered-down like gummy but it doesn't strike to me as like strawberry kind of tastes more like almost like a gummy vitamin where you know it's a berry but you don't know that specifically it tastes like strawberry what do you think it smells like fresh strawberries or when he tastes it tastes like frozen strawberry that's been in the freezer too long while you were saying about the strawberries yeah like that's pretty good very hybrid yeah and I thought got me like it definitely tastes like I've got me it's sweet um you definitely don't taste like I need super wheat or THC in it so that [ __ ] tastes more like that you did like the old-school gummies really hard like a pure weed to it and then I think a lot of people wanted to go like a lot like the skittle slavers and stuff enchilada like people really want like our candy taste and I think that's why you don't even really taste the weed in it so next one that we're gonna open is the pineapple let's go ahead and open it and see if it smells like pineapple yeah it does smell like pineapple okay I'm not really tasting a pineapple oh I do a little little bit after I chewed it for another second it does taste like pineapple yeah and for the pineapple it says ten milligrams THC but each piece has 20 milligrams in less than 2 milligrams of CBD in it pineapple 100 milligrams the same thing it's gluten free dairy free yeah not free so mmm that's the best part I think it's a both of these gummies are really good by heavy-hitters I do like heavy-hitters products am a fan especially if their cartridges her mom recently picked up a cartridge - and what did your mom say about it that's strong yeah like she took popped it once and her eyes were like red she really felt the high I think heavy hitters really brings it you know because of their brand and they're really well known and they have some really good products out there I think they're gummies are really on point um I do wish that they would have a little stronger of like a flavour - pineapple and strawberry personally but other than that they are good gummies you know they are gonna take about 90 minutes to kick in so we will give you guys a little update on the gummies later as we go but yeah so we just wanted to go ahead do another little gummy review let you guys know what we thought of them the flavoring and everything if you guys have any questions or comment or anything please go ahead and leave them in the comment section and if you want please go ahead and subscribe and hit that notification Val

This is\nserved as a pairing for one of the Le Cuvier wines but it has no alcohol in it;\nit's great for kids, it's great for anyone who likes gummy bears or\ngrapefruit juice. The recipe is very easy; start by putting about 120 milliliters,\nabout half a cup, of grapefruit juice into a bowl. Take about 22 grams, or about\n3/4 ounce, unflavored gelatin and sprinkle it on top of the juice. While\nthe gelatin is softening you're going to take about 177 milliliters, or another\n3/4 cup, of juice and put it into a small saucepan, and 59 milliliters, or\nthat's 1/4 cup of sugar, to the juice in the pan and you're going to heat that\nuntil the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot mixture from the pan over the\ngelatin in the bowl and mix it up until it's very smooth. If you like, you can\nwhisk it to get rid of any small lumps of gelatin but then you're going to want\nto let it sit so that the bubbles subside before you pour out the mixture\ninto the mold. Gummy molds are not hard to find; I bought this one online, you can\nget them in department stores, housewares stores, and they come in different sizes.\nThis is actually considered a jumbo size, gummy bear although they really are pretty small, only about an inch in length. Since the mold is very flexible, it's a\ngood idea to put it on something solid so when you put it in the refrigerator\nit doesn't bend and make a mess. Take the grapefruit mixture and pour it\ninto a pitcher, and then use the pitcher to fill the mold. When you're pouring the\nliquid in you don't have to fill each little cavity individually, you can just\npour it in and then spread it with a spatula, an offset spatula is helpful.\nNow these will firm even if left at room temperature, but if you refrigerate them\nit will happen a lot faster. These are chilled, but they're not going\nto melt at room temperature. They're really fun and they taste good!\nThanks for joining me for One Minute Maven; for more tips look for us on\nYouTube!", "q_KhBk6xQcc": "Hi everyone welcome back to Clumsy Cakes\nSo today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make very quick and easy gummy\nbears at home. So let's get started. Now we're first gonna get our gummy bear molds\nready This recipe makes one tray of gummy\nbears and this tray has 54 gummy bear molds in it. Which is not very much but I\nwanted to split up the recipe this way so that you could easily get one tray of\neach flavor that you would like. So then you can easily increase the recipe\nquantity depending on how many trays you would like. I'm just going to spray with\nnonstick spray and then we're just going to take our pastry brush and brush\ninside each cavity getting each nook and cranny just to make sure that our gummy\nbears come out all in one piece. There's nothing worse than having perfect gummy\nbears that you can't get out of the mold. Trust me, been there done that, not a fun\nexperience. Lastly, we're just going to mop up the excess oil with a paper\ntowel then this can get set aside. First we're just going to whip up our gummy\nbear solution I have 1/4 of a cup of water here then I'm going to add 2\ntablespoons of corn syrup and then I'm going to mix that up really well until\nall of the corn syrup is dissolved. So now we're just going to continue mixing\nup the solution. I'm using sorbitol in this recipe. Tt's not a primary\ningredient but it contributes to a very chewy texture that gummy bears are\nknown for or so I do like to use it.  But it's up to you. You want to make sure\nthat your water is cooled because the first step is to bloom our gelatin and\nthat just involves letting all of the gelatin\nabsorb the water before we put it on the heat to dissolve it. We're gonna be using\njello mix for the flavoring of these gummy bears. There are tons of different\nways to make gummy bears but I'm using the jello version and we're going to be\nmaking the orange flavor today. To our water and corn syrup mixture we're\ngoing to be adding half of box of flavored gelatin so that is three\ntablespoons and then we're gonna be adding a packet and a half or two three\ntablespoons of unflavored gelatin and then we're gonna be adding another three\ntablespoons of sorbitol.  We're gonna give it a good mix until it's all well\nincorporated and there are no lumps and then we're gonna give this ten minutes\nto bloom. So now we're going to heat this up over low heat and stir\nconstantly until everything is dissolved and it's a syrupy mixture. So now I'm going to use my little\neyedropper tool to fill up my cavities as neatly as I can. You do want to work\nkind of quickly with this because as the mixture cools it's going to set pretty\nimmediately so you unfortunately can't be as meticulous as you would like to be\nwhich does contribute to a little bit of a mess but it's not that big of a deal. As it cools it will just set and then\nyou can just pick it right off. If they're not perfect that is totally okay.\nI mean look at mine. So once you fill up all of your holes\nyou're just going to stick this into the refrigerator for a minimum of\nthree hours but overnight is best. So my orange gummy bears are still\nsetting in the fridge but this is what they're going to look like when they're\ndone. They're absolutely beautiful and delicious but they do have a bit of a\nwet and sticky texture. I'm gonna show you guys how to fix that. First I'm gonna\nspill all of the gummy bears on the bowl But then we're gonna use a tablespoon of\ncornstarch and put the lid on. Now we're going to shake to get them all coated. And we're gonna put them into a\ndifferent bowl and add another tablespoon of vegetable oil and mix that\naround and then we're gonna take a paper towel and just mop up the excess oil. I\nwas a little bit skeptical when I first did this technique I thought that we're\ngonna be trading off stickiness for oiliness but that is not the case.\nThey're not sticky anymore and they have a little bit of opaqueness that you\nwould find in a store-bought gummy bear If you can recall, store-bought gummy bears\ndo have a little bit of a coating on them.  They're not totally shiny and\nthat's why.

in this video I'm going to talk about how soft matter physics can help us understand material structure of gummy bears now I know the question in your mind is what could be the link between a 2000 level graduate class and squishy delicious colorful childhood phenom and the answer is polymer gels which is how a soft matter physicists will refer to gummy bears probably first let's talk about polymers polymers are long string like molecules made of certain chemical units called monomers the monomers are connected sequentially as shown here the number of monomers in a polymer is typically several thousand and can be as large as tens of million polymers are indispensable materials in modern technology they are used as plastics rubbers and textiles polymers are also the basic molecules of life the machinery of life is realized by proteins which are natural polymers of amino acids also the genetic information of life is inscribed in another important class of biopolymer DNA then what is a polymer gel a polymer gel is a mixture of the cross-linked polymer network and a solvent such gel is elastic like a rubber but unlike robert jetski gel can change its volume by taking in or expelling solvent these gels can expand or shrink up to a thousand times in volume if the Solent is water which is most of the cases the jealous cop the most common types of polymer gels used in industry are PV a PA a and PA n these gels find applications in the following industries robotics manufacturing artificial muscles and robotic actuators chemical manufacturing petrochemicals paints and coatings also the polymer gels are micro sized shelled fibers that can shrink in milliseconds whereas thick polymer layers require many minutes to react generally two hours two days going back to gummy bears first let's talk about brief history of these edible hydro gels historian bath Kimberly states that gummy candies descend from Turkish light in her book candy a sweet history as a person who grew up eating a lot of Turkish Delight this connection between Turkish light and gummy bears is extremely intriguing the gummy bear is ordinated in Germany in 1920 hence vegan of bonn germany started his own sweets company making soft colorful candies the name of his new business was a combination of the first two letters of his own first and last names and hometown hence Haribo the original base ingredients regaled used was gum arabic hence the name gummy bears but today gummy bears are made of gelatin and sugar - gelatin is a polymer that forms large three dimensional matrices which gives structural support to jellies and jams when gelatin a polymer placed in solvent which is water it swells by absorbing the solvent from the surroundings this phenomenon is called swelling adding flavor color and pouring the polymer gel to bear shape moulds results in the famous gummy bears next time you open a bag of gummy bears remember that they're just edible hydrogels", "k0rqhDVLjMw": "welcome back guys today i'm going to show you how to infuse gushers [Music] here's what you're going to need some gushers eggs to put them in tincture and a syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to pull it up thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe", "GLWRBcAOmxQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel Bros beds for those of you don't know I'm your host Christina Marie so today's video is going to be a review on these hair gummies that I have by tastebuds I just want to start doing some shorter videos you know I'm working out my consistency staying focused and just really putting out more videos that are more educational and creating that dialogue with you guys so I have these gummies here that I just thought I'd do a short review on that I really like I mean these are not sponsored videos or anything like that these are just products that I have that I've tried and just want to share the information that I have with you guys on these edibles so these are the gummies that were going to review today hopefully that got in focus there we go they are by a brand called taste buds based here out of Colorado and that is Lizzie but taste buds I first got familiar with this brand when I was by attending at the dispensary that I was at and this was a new brand test when I was there they just came in and I wasn't sure sometimes with edible brands we can just kind of start there I'm really quick it's hard with some of these edible brands to find a brand that's going to be consistent and when I say consistent I mean through the whole package if you come by this 10 pack of gummies that usually have their package for the recreational side sometimes on the medical side you can get more and then have a higher milligrams and CBD as well per gummy and packaged but sometimes with a package of gummies let's say you buy a 10 pack on the REC side 4 of them could work and then the other 6 may be in and that just really depends sometimes on how they infuse their products if it's sprayed or if it's actually cooked with the if they're doing like a co2 oil however they extract it just really depends on that sometimes um and it's so frustrating sometimes to buy like not sometimes all the time if you buy a pack of edibles that's not consistent the taste isn't good they're weedy hashey and it just has like a really gross aftertaste and then there's just nothing your waiting there and I've been how now with these I don't know if you guys have seen that meme that says when you start talking [ __ ] about the edible and then it kicks in like yes what I thought these really do kick in and for me I have my med card here in Colorado so I usually shop and get medical edibles I have a really high tolerance so they just work better for me as well and having my med card that helps like I said you can have a higher milligram per piece when you buy edibles on the medical side but these are recreational gummies and actually got these at house of dainties here in Colorado they're one of my favorite dispensaries again I'm sponsored they just have some fire s what you didn't know like the people that worked there um so I got these at how the dankness one day I wanted an edible I was going to my cousin's birthday or something and I really like indica like but if I'm smoking that's where the stream pretty much is and then edibles sometimes I'll do a sativa the reason why I don't really smoke sativas or do sativa edibles is just because I have really bad anxiety I already have a lot of energy so sativa smoking sativas or like having a sativa edible can trigger my anxiety and make me a little bit more anxious and feel a little bit more panicky so that's why I usually try to stay away from those and there are some strains and edibles that you can find that will work with you if you're someone who's like that but I just like the end because just because I feel like they give me a perfect balance because I'm already a naturally high-energy person or just have like a lot of anxiety these just give me like a perfect balance where I'm good and I can still function and maintain now depending on like if it's the end of the night because these are indica gummies I have like a little moon there on the packaging if you see that I can have like a couple more and that will put me out definitely so you just really have to figure out your dosing as well and go ahead and add that in as well with edibles everybody's body is different and everyone's body's going to react differently to certain types of edibles drinks may work better for you there are tinctures gummies chocolates I really like doing drinks or certain brands of gummies just because I feel like they hit quicker for me drinks because it's going through the saliva will hit you a little bit quicker but the [ __ ] not last as long versus ingesting it it may take a little bit longer for it to your high to hit but it may last you a little bit longer another key tip I can add for edibles as well not just on this brand of edibles in general is that they do work better with the fact that you consume in your body so I am working on eating better and healthier but if I'm gonna have it edible I don't want to have like a little bit of fat content to activate that THC as if you're eating an edible on an empty stomach or like a super super healthy meal and there's no fat content looks like a juice or something it may not work right and that's maybe what the problem is so make sure that you're consuming a little bit of fat before you have any kind of edible not just this brand but back to taste buds one thing I like about them after doing some research is that their oil that they extract and use in their gummies has to test over 70% and then also I say that they are the first strain-specific gummy here in Colorado which is cool meaning that on their packaging right here on the side it'll tell you that this was made with Afghani so you know exactly what strain is has been um in your gummy are your edible so I think that's very cool and that they also have as standard as far as where their oil should be testing at now let me show you what the gummy looks like I do like it because there's no sugar coating on it they're fat-free and gluten-free but they do have your ingredient oak glucose I was until you guys just in case if that's an issue for you and gelatin but I like this consistency like that you know typical gummy type of consistency just because they're like they're just really chewy and juicy or not wheaty or hashey they're so good like right before you go to bed are you just trying to chill out the function popping one of these looks like a little jello shot so so but again this is not sponsored I really just like tastebuds because their products have been consistent for me and they really work and it's a recreational edible that's um really great price you just have to check your local dispensary to see what they're charging some places are different and hey and what else was I going to add on to that I'm sorry oh yeah they have two four flavors - four indica - four sativa and they also offer a CBD option as well which is really nice I think it's like a green apple flavor and then the other indica flavor is a tropical fruit or something like that and they have blueberry and kiwi strawberry for the sativa don't quote me so host but I'm pretty sure I hope I got that right but anyway I just want to do a review I do like them I do recommend them if you're someone that has again a lot of anxiety and you're looking for something to kind of give you a nice balance for the daytime you can do a half a piece of these nighttime you can do a whole I would recommend you know just be safe about it I'm not a doctor or anything like that I can just tell you from my experience of working in an industry and what I know and then from times that I've tried edibles as well you know everybody's body is different you're going to react a little bit differently than your friend she your friend might have homies who sometimes will have a half of a piece like a half like a five milligram and that's like my that's consider like micro dosing and for me I would say my max I can have at least maybe like a 800 to a thousand milligrams depends on what the product is or you know what's happening but um you know just depends on your body is different I'm out here going hard but anyway that is it that is off if you have any questions on this review tastebuds or anything like that on edibles if you have any edibles that you'd like me to try or that you'd like me to review please let me know down below also be sure to follow me on instagram at rosebuds underscore hi that's H I and share this video comment subscribe I definitely am working on my consistency and

on the show today we're going to make some cinnamon gummy bears using some silicone candy molds from bargain robot comm this is a great and fun project for the upcoming holiday or for a nice evening with your kids so join me as we make cinnamon gummy bears you so the really nice people at bargain robach calm sent me these really cute silicone molds they are great for making candy if you want to make little chocolates you can do all kinds of things in these and what's great is stuff doesn't stick to them and I even wash these in the dishwasher so what they sent me these are little hearts those would be really cute for making one of Eric's favorite little treats and that is little peanut butter cups this one has little bears hippos and lions this one is for Christmastime has some gingerbread men and some little candy canes and this one for springtime we got flowers we got tulips and then flowers so those are really cute I'm gonna have a really good time using these so if you're interested in some silicone molds go ahead and check out bargain rollback com I'll leave a link to these in the description so what we're going to do today is we're going to test these out by making our own homemade gummy bears and yes you can make gummy bears right in your own house and it is really really fun it's a great activity for kids and it is so easy so let's make our gummy bears so you're gonna be so surprised how really fast and easy this is to make and I could see a bunch of kids sitting around making a lot of different flavors and colors of gummy bears they will love it so what we're going to do is we're going to take 1/3 cup of regular tap water and we're going to take one package of jell-o and I got cherry jello cuz we're gonna make cinnamon I kind of thought the red cherry would go with the cinnamon but you can use whatever kind you like you can make all kinds of different kinds so we're going to go ahead and put our package of jell-o in Yeah right we're also going to put in three envelopes of gelatine this is basically unflavored gelatin we need to get our jello basically super power to be able to make our gummy bears so we're gonna really give this little bit of water a lot of gelatin these are 0.25 ounce packages of jello and I this recipe I actually don't know where it originally came from making gummy bears there's this recipe is all over the internet so I can't really give credit to the person who actually made this because there's no way to know who it was if you happen to know then let me know right but thank you to whoever that was that developed this so we have a package this is a three ounce package of jell-o we have three package of gelatine and we have a third of a cup of water now to give us our cinnamon flavor we are going to add some cinnamon oil and you get it in this little two pack of these little things I got this at Michael's if you use a coupon they're really inexpensive they're only like a couple dollars anyway and I still use the coupon and I'm going to use a quarter teaspoon of the cinnamon oil this is going to give us our cinnamon flavor you can use as much or as little as you want quarter teaspoon gives you a nice cinnamon flavor you can actually supercharge it and put a whole bunch so we're going to go ahead and stir this up and combine this right here off the heat just make sure you kind of get the lumps out of it ooh I can smell the cinnamon you get actually any kind of oils that you can find you can make flavor if I can find some hot chili pepper oil Eric could love hot chili pepper gummy bears I've even seen people make adult gummy bears and you know what I mean with that little vodka a little brandy all that fun stuff so we've got this combined and we're going to go ahead and let this sit for five minutes off the heat then we're going to put it on the heat and melt it so after five minutes it's like gels up and it looks like this it's not hard it's really soft but it looks like this kind of consistency that gelatine really gels really fast so we're going to put it over a medium burner and we're gonna let it melt so let's put it over on the burner I already have it preheated you just want to continually to stir so it's nice and melted so now it's all melted we want to loop move our liquid into something that has a pour spout because we're going to put these in our molds and if you don't have a pour spout you're gonna make a mess and this red coloring could stain your counter so you don't want to do that okay so now we're ready to pour our molds and now we're just going to pour our little mixture into the molds to make our little gummy bears and how many this makes really depends on how big your molds are these molds are great I could see myself making all kinds of little chocolate it's for Eric I can't eat chocolates but he sure can so this is going to make little hippos its gonna make little lions and it's gonna make a little bears and this one here is gonna make little hearts which are going to be great with a red so we're going to let these set up you just want to set them out room temperature for about thirty minutes they're gonna gel up and we're gonna have our very own homemade cinnamon gummy bears so it's been a little over half hour and we're gonna unmold our little bears here or our shapes so this is the silicone molds and look at how easy they come out these are the little hearts and we're just gonna pop them out just like that look at that isn't that adorable yeah we have gummy hearts I love this is a small one that I did with the leftover so you can make these as big or as small as you want here are some little bears oh that's a toot and here we have a little hippo and a little lion oh look they're so cute these molds are so easy nothing sticks to them they just pop right out these are a little sticky so you can put a little cornstarch on them if you want them it does make them like light like there's flour something on them but it will keep them from sticking but that's just a major of homemade gummy bears we will get our hearts out here are adorable we have our little hearts our little lions our little bears I love them they're so cute and you can you can really smell the cinnamon so let's try them we got cherry and cinnamon mmm all right taste this light gummy bear mmm salmon if you really want your cinnamon hot you could really crank that cinnamon up I think this is a really good blend of the cherry and the cinnamon try that mmm it's funny how they really gel up I mean this is Blaine jello it would just be Wiggly but that gelatine really they just get kind of hard not hard but not like jello Wow they're great so a little of your very own cinnamon gummy bear so easy to make and your kids will love them if you like this recipe please subscribe below and leave me a comment and a like and visit my website at a me learn to cook calm I'm also on Twitter and Pinterest at Amy learns to cook you must die", "irQvPovU8fM": "good morning beautiful people of the interwebs puffin pete and of course mr puffington we are coming at you with a new one we are doing a review of moxie viper cookies papaya oh g yes viper cookies papaya og live resin sauce now i normally don't do sauces because they're pain in my ass but but i thought today just in case i got the luca sea horse so that uh a worst case scenario i'll just dab it with that okay viper cookies papaya og by moxie again i got this because it was on sale at my dispensary for st patrick's day let's be honest it was on sale because it's three plus months old so it is packaged december 31st and here we are basic ass profile typical of moxie they are the most basic i mean you're paying overpriced why not just not give you any information either thc 3.07 thca 83.67 uh thcv zero cbd0 cbga 0.78 cbda cbdv and cbn are zeros cbg is 0.98 and delta 8 with a 0.03 total cannabinoids 88.53 there is zero terpene information on this zero zip zilch nauta so it is what it is you know it's it's moxie so it's going to be one of those things give me one second here i gotta let the cat out of the room she's freaking what'd you do get yourself shut in here go on chloe weirdo huh cat life i tried to ignore it i thought maybe she just chilled but no she wanted out and i'm not gonna force her to sit in here so okay we already know there's no terpene profile it's fairly potent viper cookies papaya og i i it sounded really good um i like the papaya thought again i've avoided the hell out of these because of their cost so that's some decent looking sauce it's uh it's actually lighter yellow than it looks on that on what i'm seeing on the camera it looks awfully dark to me but it's really not um looks like there's little diamond chunks in the sauce not very many but a couple little ones it's actually more of a yellow golden color kind of smells like flower rosin yeah it kind of smells like fresh pressed flower rods and i'm not a big fan of that smell i mean don't get me wrong i don't mind flower bras and i've pressed it i do it occasionally but it's just not my favorite thing in the world i guess we'll uh we'll bring the straw out i don't want to get the dab rig out right this second let me try it with the straw see how it goes i know it's charged i got a new tip on here so let's go into it not bad it kind of tastes like a live resin cartridge which you know they're not that great it's all right i'm going for another hit oh not too shabby this little seahorse isn't bad you know 32 online the tips don't last a whole hell of a lot of time but they're only like 25 for five uh coils so that's the quartz ones like five for 25. um well i will say it's kind of strong just two decent little hits and i'm already starting to feel it not too bad all right we're gonna go in for another one cheers oh wow the only problem with doing that is it's just like a one of your like puffco pro uh the plus there's no water diffusion so it's just straight so it's kind of rough a little bit sometimes now i'm going to try to do a derb of it in the rig here it's probably going to be folly because it's so sauce it's all sauce it's messy but we're going to try it it's only a half a g so not a whole hell of a lot of choice here it doesn't it's not going to last forever obviously um yeah all right so we got a little bit on the tool yeah i'm a tool shut up i don't wanna hear it all the jokes aside um yeah okay so that was a little easier than i thought it was gonna be sometimes it doesn't like to come off the dab tool and just smears around and makes a mess which is why i don't normally put them in my dab rig i just use the straw if i happen to buy a sauce now i'll be honest with you i was not supposed to get the sauce i was supposed to get the sugar because they had them both and i ended up with the sauce by mistake they were the same price so i didn't give a [ __ ] all right let's torch up my dirty dab break and dirty rig clean banger go figure it's been a crazy week got a bunch of [ __ ] accomplished got my kovid shot my first one anyway and i'm just you know been crazy getting stuff accomplished you know the aftertaste on this is kind of floral i don't know if you quite get what i mean but it's interesting that's got to be the papaya i'm tasting cheers nice okay i'm going to say this hitting it with a torch and a dab rig really brings out that papaya flavor yeah in a good way like wow i thought it tasted good before it's so much better with the dab rig and the water diffusion it's gotta be a temperature thing damn wow i can't believe how good that tastes like i hate to give you know the credit like that to moxie but because the [ __ ] is overpriced but uh no it's decent a little dirty it's a little dark but no it's decent minor throat burn a little bit of a tickle but as far as sativas go um wow i'm not like jittery i can definitely feel the surge of energy i'm more motivated but i'm i'm focused and uh yeah i like this it's not getting my anxiety up um i'm still getting good pain relief which right now pain relief is the most important thing for me with this knee um i still can't believe i fell and tore it up right before christmas ah so i find out tomorrow the results of the mri we'll see if i'm gonna have to have surgery or not so who knows i won't know till tomorrow but wish me luck oh i think we need another derpsky guys one more for the road it's gonna be a good day it's thursday there's the [ __ ] that i work with i like the guy don't get me wrong he's a nice guy with kind of a [ __ ] head sometimes at work and he's going to be off for the day and so it's not that i don't mind that it's just that there he eggs on another co-worker and then i have to hear political arguing all day and i get over i'm over the political arguments and the conspiracy theories and the fighting and just ready for some more positivity and love in the world you know what i mean i'm just over all the nonsense ready for the anger and the hatred to stop just stop stop all the back biting stop all the backstabbing stop all the underhanded [ __ ] stop all the greed help each other out elevate each other you see a friend struggling to make it help them up if you can you know like hey you need to connect you need to shout out you need a hookup you need somebody to you know you need somebody to introduce you to somebody so you have a business partner you know just help somebody out if you can don't don't just sit there and watch somebody struggle and pretend to be their friend when you can help them and you don't let's just do something you know i guess the point is i'm trying to make is and no no this is not a personal situation that's happening i'm just saying overall i see all kinds of stuff going on in the industry out of the industry says why can't we all get along man people need to have be a little more chill just enjoy life more i promise you as somebody who just used to freak out over everything i took everything personally i worried about everything constantly once you can stop doing that as much if not all the way and you can get over yourself or get over the fears and get over all the insecurities and the horseshit believe it or not your life will get far far more simple far easier far more manageable cheers oh nice wow yeah i'm pretty good now i can see it in my eyes on a small screen from six feet away so yeah i'm good wow guys so i'm gonna give this one like a seven out of ten mainly because it does burn my throat the papaya og viper cookies cross by moxie not too shabby guys i mean it's a 7 out of 10 solid it's got a throat burning tickle it'll kind of linger with you flavor's on point though if you use the dab rig if you use the torch it's decent it's not great but if you use the dab rig of flavor is on point with the papaya at least my batch was i really liked that so not too bad moxie you know just got to work on your pricing man when you're charging more than gold it's just it's too much so and you know i i fell for the sale because oh it's the holiday no it's because it's starting to go you know older one of them was like four six months old so i mean stop just make your prices better and then people buy it more and people be happier and people just don't understand that they just oh and that's the other thing patience stop the mentality of oh it costs more so it must be better that's not always the case sometimes you don't get what you pay for just say it that's not again that's not always the case either but you know buyer beware but moxie thank you for the decent medicine i like this as far as sativas going the sativas are a hard one because of anxiety so good job with this 7 out of 10 guys and lower your prices greedy patience over profits patience over profits thank you for watching like comment share subscribe hit that notification bell good things are coming we've

alright guys so welcome to new video today this one's gonna be absolutely crazy we got 12 pounds of gummy worms and we're gonna be a gummy bear Rico but we're gonna be making slime so yeah we're gonna be making edible slime and we also got some pretty crazy stuff that we're gonna put in this lime so me George are gonna be like yeah me enjoyed they're gonna put warheads in there and we're gonna make a super super sour also sour skittles as well kala is gonna do business dogs swaps sweets ours we're just gonna make some crazy edible slime and how exactly did she find the slime expert we do it all baby wine expert so what made you interested so okay so you gotta take these out of the bag first so these all out can just make slime yeah and right now it looks like you know there's a pun in here but you guys have got to remember after its melted it's gonna go down a little bit but this is I think it's me you have eight pounds so each bag is two pounds we got four you are so much more in here fan we're gonna make it literally a mountain all right no it's good all right okay okay full of gummi bears I mean gummy worms I mean what I'm kidding what we're gonna do now is we're gonna put them in the microwave oh yeah you're the expert okay one all right so you microwave it for like 10 seconds at a time slowly melt it and then we're gonna mix some of this powdered sugar and corn starts in there and then we're gonna measure put it in this bowl and then just start working it in there and make okay so can we put this one in the microwave first all right all right all right all right so you put it in there for 10 seconds blows up forever that's such a big bowl I told you we need a bigger bowl make it for a minute it's gonna like burn it right I think you should do a little more let's just put it between it leave the house and we'll come back and we'll see what happened it's like it's like those crazy microwave videos if you guys have ever seen like those crazy microwave videos where they like microwave things they blow things up oh my gosh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah so I'm just sitting here waiting for all the other slime to melt and I walk in cuz I'm like where's Simon just like chillin the like the blind oh my gosh Simon what are you doing I just little jet caught him trying no stop stop you can't climb the curtains my dude I just got crazy that's that I did stick your finger in there do it alright so this is the final time we microwave that so that is done with the microwave now we need to do the sugar and the cornstarch okay Simon what do you think of this crazy slime video what are you thinking of it do you think it's do you think it's cool buddy do you think it's cool I don't know buddy what he feels about it do you looking stressed out where you going honey my face no I mean it blowing my nose he's just chilling he's just till he's been sleeping all day literally all day up there he goes like my thumb there you go bitin my thumb he's got my thumb in his mouth ow ow little assignment slimes so now the process is doing the sugar and the cornstarch okay so how exactly do we do this my master so this is gonna make it a little bit thicker like actual slime yeah sticky stuff so we have to do equal parts of each one so you do is go up a day doesn't matter how much it's just you got to do the same emoji oh that's because that's a lot it's for all of us to [ __ ] oh okay you can just worry like well just put it well put in a little bit at a time just as much as whatever you think you need just so it gets to that perfect texture that you want it to be that perfect it's my spoon I'm gonna mix this stuff up all right amount of cornstarch so we're gonna slowly put this in right [Music] all right so we're just gonna slowly just dump them in there yeah basically okay we're mixing around all right ready yeah I'm just gonna slowly pull it in [Music] [Music] we're definitely gonna need a lot more sugar but this stuff is just oh my gosh look at this so I can just pick all this up and this week so so it's oh look I'm trying to get it off my hands and I physically I can't get off my hand I she got hers really good extremely sticky but it's we're definitely getting the slime you got slide there yeah there you go I got super sticky stuff that I don't know what to do it but it's really cool it's really actually very very satisfying to play with I would highly recommend you guys to try this at home definitely have some parents advantage in definitely permission for awhile unless you're over 18 but this stuff is so so sick it's really easy to make because all we did is we got gummy bears cornstarch and sugar that's it it's like a trap it's literally a trap cuz look now I got so we view so much snow dirt and cornstarch we're trying to get it more like slime because right now it's pretty much like it kind of it's still like a sticky texture we don't want it to be sticky we want it you know to be son because slime isn't really sticky it's just kind of gooey that's what we're trying to get rid of is a sticky nettle which hopefully we're able to accomplish that with the sugar and the cornstarch but the thing is is we don't know how much to use should we use more sugar or should we use more cornstarch that's the kind of level we're trying to write they're gonna continue mixing and we're just gonna see kind of it goes where it is Simon pretty go buddy you want to smell my finger it probably smells really weird yeah I don't think you'd like it all right back to mixing not doing too well let's see how George is doing over here there we go okay so he definitely still need a ton of sugar there's sugar all over the counter we're actually running out of sugar like there's none in here that's out that's this is the only sugar that we have is that and that's not very much at all bush goes do it back at home dude but looky Kayla she has the best one she's the winner for this video check this out and it's not even that sticky she can get it you can get it off of her hands like no problem there you go winner for the best slime oh the same color of your shirt - its slime this is look at this oh this is very satisfying here okay the other side it's actually really sticky though no no don't give him this lime don't give him the side let him show that's his little this is his place this is chill place you can't fall asleep buddy yeah I would fall asleep to these YouTube videos are pretty boring I just roasted myself so basically guys what we're doing right now is we're trying to move all the other bowls out of the way because those are basically dead bowls because we don't have enough sugar but we do have enough slime to still do this we have a huge piece of slime right here this is Kahless and then we have this little bunch from me because this stuff is just perfect as long as you coat sugar into it it won't be super sticky so we can actually use and ease our with these like juicy drop stuff it has like these pins with extreme sour gel in it are you gonna make your sour are you gonna put it I'm gonna put warheads in it oh that it's gonna be so so sour oh my god what is this smell like it's so sour so what is this stuff it's the juicy drop and it comes with like these little gummies and you're supposed to squirt him in the gummies but I'm just using this straight sour joke yeah so I'm working with little warheads over here and I'm just trying to unpackage them and put them in here basically there's a ton of them in here if we can just dump all these out ooh we got a ton of warheads to work with right here like playgrounds this guy so we'll try to get more heads up so we got Kayla trying to mix up all the crit I got some of it on my fingers there Oh gross okay so I got all my warheads right here this is my slime I'm gonna grab all these warheads loose and I'm just gonna sprinkle them out sour dough in there alright guys so I think I'm gonna take a bit of mine should I take a bite of it here we go guys are you ready the moment of truth the slot some of the warheads is to hold it out alright so there's about ten warheads in here I'm trying to mix it up a little bit better so they don't fall out but I'm gonna pull it apart here Oh Oh big is another warhead all right I see a warhead right there I'm gonna go for this bite Georgia's not bad hmm how's it taste the slime is actually really good but the warhead I got multiple warheads not one oh really mmm I'm gonna taste this bad this is mine with all this sour dough in there oh oh it's so so sour I just gotta say that what you just doing yeah dentists if you're watching this we're sorry yeah we're sorry three warheads during class and his Floyd died mm-hmm while reading a book remember the first time I tried where I was in like third grade and I was now [Music] so apparently kayla has a super super sour bite for me here that's super okay it's literally just she just poured this whole thing on there all right so I'm going in for the bite here ready ready one two so you got double how are you feeling right now it's not that bad your face makes it look like it's pretty bad yeah okay got like a big piece of bubble in my mouth oh wait no no you have these chewy sours so all right you stick that in there blue gel all over there all right get a warhead as well no no no no get a warhead get a warhead no get a warhead get a warhead get a warhead you're taking a warhead all right let's do this blue is the worst honestly blue is like probably want to put it in there all right both of them both the sour two in sour chew and the warheads and the sour sour job all yours have fun Oh go go go go [Music] yeah that looks pretty sour there you took a pretty good chunk out of that to [Music] 110 nice so much regret to be completely honestly not lying together anything this stuff actually tastes really good if you guys do decide to do this at home don't be like oh it's gonna taste gross it actually tastes good like it tastes just like the candy but just in a squishy like you know slimed form kind of weird and a little more flour to it as well so for sugar sorry sugar not water sorry sugar definitely not safe for you tea definitely don't eat a lot of it because like there is so so much you have to use so much sugar we use to know four pounds of sugar yeah we use four pounds of sugar just in some of these mixes like that is so much sugar that's absolutely absurd but we do have our slime it has been successful there we go so we definitely have a huge mess to clean up here you guys can see here's all the other slime over here as well we got the jalapeno chips as well got all the other gummy bears that we didn't use and then this is the old batch of so oh my gosh I can barely pick up the screws look at this like this it's picking up the whole bowl oh my gosh it's going to the ceiling [Music] it's picking up the whole bowl look alright

low-calorie treat snuck in some skittles for him and I grabbed a handful of gummi bears for myself sugarless Haribo gummy bears satan's diarrhea hate bears i sampled one when they arrived and i thought they were they're pretty good for taste I would read these five these motherfrakkers are fabulous after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose I'm talking thunder farts from the pits of hell I started feeling funny in my tummy I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined the cramping started about an hour later I'm going to have to allow this lava from Satan to forcefully expel itself from my innards I call out to every muscle in my body for help yeah my legs are flexed in my arms and shoulders and back are stiff I managed to Waddle like a penguin to the men's restroom only to find that every stall is in use anyone looking on would think that I am having an upright seizure to be honest I'd I'd trade a seizure for this moment a thousand seizures do I go ahead and then fulfill the dream of every high school boy and and poop in the urinal the explosive gas let out and into an explosive shart I felt some wetness in my underpants one mile from home on my walk and yeah and I had a mess fortunately for compression shorts it didn't run down my legs sure enough I had I had full full-on Hershey squirts in my boxers now I can successfully say that I know what it's like to vomit out my butt my butt became an upside-down volcano those Satan's diarrhea hate bears did something to my insides that caused my sphincter to vomit out the madness what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel the Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I nearly shat myself inside out pretty sure my boxers clogged that toilet it went on for hours I am severely dehydrated my external anal sphincter could not do his job and it remained open and relaxed while about five seconds of gas was expelled the other men can sense that something isn't right I've never experienced or even heard of that happening and I have set a new world record for most poops in a five-hour period with nine it was so unnatural that I had to check and feel if my colon had somehow pushed his way through my anal sphincter muscle I was laying in the fetal position on my bathroom floor sobbing I'm leaking horrible there was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding back in 2005 I'm a 280 pound man I was sobbing I'm screaming my son is crying because he thinks he's witnessing the death of his father I told a friend about what had happened to me not a word was said what a diaper I was thrown over the stall she said she really wished that she had listened I think she was crying I caught it I lined my underwear with it and put my pants back on and I walked out of that bathroom like a champ I'm able to fit back into the jeans that I wore in high school so not all bad I suppose be sure to also buy a tub of OxiClean with this to get the blood and diarrhea stains out of your underwear you will totally spray the bowl and the back of the seat your clothes your furniture these bears cost me a pair of boxers and my dignity your pets your loved ones the ceiling fan I'm lying on the

It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "8deEGBKOykQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be making some keto sugar-free gummies I totally love these gummies I love that there's no food coloring and they're so simple to make they're easy they're kid-approved you can take them on the go and they're really low-calorie so if you want to see how to make these and how to customize them yourself then go ahead and keep watching the video you don't need that many things you're gonna need some hot water some teabags some gelatin liquid sweetener and some mix-ins if you'd like to switch up the flavors today I'm going for Tazo passion tea I love this blend it's so delicious it's very fruity so I love that I can make some fruit gummies and I also love that I can make sour gummies which I'll show you how I do that in just a second I like to use something with a spout so this little measuring cup works perfect for this if you don't have a water kettle then you're gonna want a microwave or boil your water ahead of time and then let it steep in this little pitcher so that there's a spout on it so after it cools down I put it in the refrigerator to chill completely look how dark that is it's just so good it extracted all of that delicious flavor from the teabags and you don't have to squeeze out your teabags like I do but I like to get all the liquid out some T's it can make the liquid cloudy and if you want to avoid that to make nice clear gummies just don't squeeze it I don't have a problem with this specific tea so at this point you with your cold liquid you're gonna add your gelatin you can get this kind of gelatin which you would just have to measure out with a table spoon or a scale like I'm doing here and I'm gonna measure out 28 grams but you can also use the packets and it's four tablespoons or four packets so I'm gonna measure out 28 grams which is also equal to one ounce on my scale and then I'm gonna stir that in completely you want to mix it in really really really well and if your liquid is cold it'll mix in really well so when you do chill it make sure you chill your tea down all the way and then you're gonna microwave it for 30 seconds three times depending on your microwave until it's completely liquid and hot and then I just like to give it one more stir just to make sure that it's totally incorporated I like liquid sucralose you guys can use whatever sweetener you want you can use granular sweetener and just make sure that it's hot enough to mix in and totally dissolve the sweetener so I like to use a roughly half of a teaspoon of sweetener you can use liquid stevia if you'd like and then at this point you'll add in all of your mix ins you can do apple cider vinegar for Tang but I want mine really sour so I went ahead and I'm going to use some citric acid I have a bunch of this stuff it's food grade and it's totally fine to add if you don't want to use some sort of man-made substance then you can use lemon or whatever else you'd like so just mix it in really really well you want that completely dissolved because that stuff is super sour and if you'd like you can add your extracts I have lemon and raspberry but I'm not gonna add anything else to mine but that's just an option I want to let you guys know about so give a one final little stir always taste your mixture because that's what your gummies are gonna taste like I wanted mine just a little bit more sweet so I added a little bit more liquid sucralose you know do what you guys want to do if you want I'm super sweet Yolo just do whatever you want to do and then I am going to scrape off all the bubbles because once this sets the bubbles are going to basically dry on top and to avoid it looking not so appealing you just go ahead and scrape those off it's not a big deal I really love this mold I got it at a thrift store but I'm pretty sure that you could find something similar on eBay or Amazon and it works really well for these little individual gummies if you're extra just scrape off the top again just to make sure that they're nice and clear and chill them all the way so those are easy to remove from the mold and this is what you're left with eat some and then package the rest up I keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're nice and chewy every single time I want one and I hope you guys try this out if you do leave me a comment down below let me know what you think thank you so much for watching you guys I'll see you in my next video [Music]", "ka1V0ztvt24": "[Music] hello goof-offs and jack-offs and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "5hsCZVvIsbU": "all right what's up everybody your main homie EDF India's bringing you guys a little review of wild edibles now these are a delicious way of consuming cannabis or the consistency to match so finding your perfect dosage is honestly really easy my favorite is about thirty milligrams or three pieces which I personally found was the perfect high before you start hitting that area where you start getting anxiety here and there you know ten milligrams was also a very comfortable micro dose amount it was a really easy high and you weren't really gone you were just chilling having a good time the packaging was a fun experience honestly I really had a good time just opening it up for twenty dollars for a hundred milligrams this is like your average price and honestly it's a really good flavor it's consistent and it's really potent which make it worth trying but it honestly is just another edible on the market there's nothing so special where it's like oh man I'm gonna keep coming back but honestly it really is a great product and I would do it again alright guys thanks for checking this out just like subscribe share do all that good stuff and I'm out [Music]", "Gegk2rilKlI": "[Music] Barry Barry Barry Barry Barry Barry Barry Barry very very very very very very very very what ice cream flavor should I have today I overheard you saying that and I know a new ice cream flavor it's EPS cream by Goliath [Music]", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this

and we hear that it can be good for our joints or even as a snack or dessert I'm gonna talk about the gummy bears and all the jelly stuff that's on the market so honestly today we have a huge variety of products on the market that are available and me as a host coach and consciousness coach I would recommend to not ever eat anything that has colorings not natural colorings in it and come is consistent of pure chemicals please look at the label every time you go to the store I have something in my hand right now and I am gonna recommend this product but it does not necessarily have to be this it can be anything so this is a keto gummy bears and the three tastes in this box peach apple and strawberry I'm gonna read you the ingredients of this right now it seems like a snack that our kids love at the same time it's all natural based and the colorings are out of juices juicing natural juicing and this is healthy and this is can be eating but please avoid came across colorings and other products so ingredients of this prebiotic soluble fiber from chicory root gelatine MCT oil which is on itself an amazing an amazing supplement I would recommend everybody to take at least a little bit a day it has some malic acid it has packed in packs in and itself is absorbing the toxins from a human body and the flavor comes from apple strawberry in Peach coconut oil the colorings come from purple carrot juice chlorophyll supplement better keratin supplement which gives it better keratin gives it an orange color and chlorophyll gives it a green color this is amazing and stevia there is no sugar in this you know the kids today they are different and the sugars should be avoided for adults and as kids as well and colorings too if you want to remain healthy happy and library

what do you think", "CIfEKmJ3_zs": "- Hey guys! Welcome back to Led Fit. I'm Serein, half of Led Fit. Chris is the other half and he's behind the camera today filming. Today's video is all about how to make sugar free gummy bears. These are a great high protein snack to take with you to the movies,\non the go, for your kids. This is gonna be really easy to do and depending on the fruit juice you use, or depending on your flavoring, you can essentially\nmake this as zero sugar and low carb as you would like. This is also a great\nreplacement for your kids. If you're trying to wing\nthem off of refined sugars, at least you can replace the juice with a all natural fruit juice and at least this way they're\ngetting the antioxidants and a natural sugar\nversus a refined sugar. So let's start with what\nyou're going to need to create this recipe. You're gonna need some\nsort of a silicone mold. I got this from Amazon. It was relatively affordable\nfor a pack of three and then the little dropper\nto dispense this in. I will link the ones I purchased\nin the description box, but you can get whatever\nmold that you want as long as it's silicone\nso that it pops out easily. Then you're gonna want,\nof course, some gelatin. I do eat meat, so I have regular gelatin. It's pure protein. I bought the large box because you're gonna\nneed quite a bit of this. If you buy the normal four pack envelopes, you're gonna use the entire\nbox for one cup of liquid. We're gonna want some sort of\na juice or water, something. Um, I have these Tohi Aronia berry drinks. These have no added sugars. Aronia berry is very\nsimilar to the Acai berry but has more antioxidants. A total of 12 grams of carbohydrates for an entire can. If you're sticking to a\nstrick ketogenic diet, then I would say, don't use this, use a sugar free Gatorade, a sugar free juice that you can find in\nyour local grocery store. Because I did do a test\nrun of these gummies, and they were actually quite fun and chewy and gummy-like\nand perfectly shaped. I did feel like I was missing\na little bit of that sweet and tart factor, so I went and picked up the vitamin strawberry watermelon\nliquid water enhancer with Vitamins B3, B6, and B12. This has no added sugars. There are some sugar alcohols in this, so it depends on how your\nbody reacts to sugar alcohols. Again, avoid maltodextrin. Or you can of course\nuse a liquid monkfruit or a monkfruit type of powder because we are gonna heat everything up. So that's everything you're gonna need and of course a measuring cup. You're gonna want one cup of liquid and I'm gonna use the rest of\nthis berry juice that I have. And then I'm gonna pop\nopen the second can. (can opening) (background music) (liquid pouring) Now I'm gonna add a couple drops of this strawberry\nwatermelon vitamin situation. (background instrumentals) Taste it and make sure\nit's the right sweetness. So, I'm gonna stir it up and taste it. (fork hitting glass) That definitely helped with the sweetness so I'm gonna add a little bit more. (fork hitting glass) And remember when you add the gelatin it's gonna dilute the flavor a little bit, so you do want it a little\nbit more tart and sweet. Heat up your liquid. You don't want it to boil but you definitely want\nit to be hot enough so that the gelatin\ndissolve in this mixture. (liquid pouring) (fire flame crackling) So I'm just gonna let that heat up while I measure out the gelatin. For one cup of liquid, you're gonna want 30 grams of gelatin. It's better to have a little\nbit more than a little bit less because you want it to be nice and firm and sturdy as a gummy bear. So now that the liquid is heated, I'm gonna pour it back\ninto my measuring cup just cause I prefer it this way. (liquid pouring) And then we're gonna add in the gelatin. So we're adding in a little\nbit over 30 grams of gelatin per one cup. (paper crinkling) (paper taring) (paper crinkling) (background music) Then you're gonna wanna\nmix this up really well. I like to use a fork. (fork hitting glass) Now for the fun part, and this\nis very therapeutic for me. You're going to take this little dropper and you're going to fill\neach of these little gummies. (background instrumental beats) (background instrumental beats) I always have a little bit of liquid left. I'm just gonna pour it\ninto a glass container and then you can cut it out. - -want these in the fridge. You want to let them sit\nfor at least 20-30 minutes in the fridge and then\nyou can pop them out. And a good tip is to not have\nthem sit in direct sunlight once they're done, they will melt in heat. They do last, like\nthrowing them in your bag and kind of going about your day. Just keep them out of direct sunlight and like very hot situations. But we'll be right back in\nabout 30 minutes for me, two seconds for you, to see the final results. And we're ready to check\nout all the gummies. So cute. So it's been a little over 30 minutes and the gummies should be all set now. With the silicone molds they're really easy to just pop right out. And look how cute they are! (background instruments) Definitely much more flavorful. There's a nice little tartness to it. (background instruments) And it's quite sweet. I really like them. So all you have to do is pop them out, put them in a container or a zip lock bag or some sort of a bag. Keep them in the fridge when\nyou're not gonna eat them, but you can take them on the go. Super good, super easy. Way healthier than conventional gummies. So I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you did, don't forget\nto give it a thumbs up.

so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned yes yes hey attend for the chuckles one love one love [Music]", "_RUjGvspR7g": "hey guys ever since I made orange jello I've been dying to try different variations and this watermelon jello that we're making today is perfect for summer I'm Megan I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so let's both our ingredients you'll need a whole seedless watermelon coconut water and unflavored gelatin so the first thing we need to do is slice into our watermelon make sure that you're getting a seedless watermelon so you don't have to find all the seeds so I'm going to take a really heavy knife and cut right through once my watermelon is sliced I'm scooping all the flesh right into a blender so I'm going to bring it down and I'm just gonna use a spoon to do this with but I'm really gonna dig in here and get everything out so I've really scooped every bit of watermelon flesh that I can out of the watermelon you'll also notice that there's some pure watermelon juice left behind and what I'm gonna do is to put that right through a strainer into my container so I'm going to dump it in and then I'm going to use a really high-powered blender to puree the water mine once my watermelons pureed I'm gonna pour it through a strainer and that's because I want a really pure juice so there's not a lot of texture in my jello my juice has been strained but I want a very very pure juice otherwise the texture is not quite right in the jello and I experiment too many times so I know so what I'm gonna do is dump out the dregs of this into my sink and then restrain it through here until I have about two cups my juice is finally ready and I'm going to combine it with my gelatin next now I am using a grass-fed gelatin today because you guys commented in my orange dollar recipe that this is the kind I should be using and I take your comments very seriously so it's what I'm using today I'm going to sprinkle it right in my pan and to it I'm gonna add my watermelon juice and finally I'm gonna add a little bit of coconut water this is because even though the watermelon juice has been strained it's a pretty thick juice and this helps send it out I'm gonna let this sit for about two minutes for the gelatin to dissolve before putting it on my stove I'm gonna turn the burner on low and whisk constantly for about five minutes my jello mixture is all melted and next I need to pour it into my container my vessel which is my empty watermelon what I'm gonna do is Pat it dry because I have found that if you don't have a really dry really clean that watermelon the jello just kind of slides off it tends to do that anyway but this really helps it stick a little bit more you can see that I put my watermelon in a bowl that's so I don't have to hold it while I pour my jello in all that's left to do is let your jello set in your refrigerator for about four to six hours my watermelon is out of the refrigerator you can tell my kids gotcha before I was able to show you guys the final product but I hope your kids love it as much as mine do it's a true testament to what a fun summer treat it is thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye guys", "jFV3Nb-ulSo": "it has almost been a year since recreational marijuana has been legalized in Colorado and business is thriving edible cannabis products account for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "Gvb530j1Ux4": "hi I'm Chrissy from summer storm welcome to the thunderstorm family we produce

use all-natural ingredients coloring and flavoring we precisely weigh all of our ingredients out to ensure consistency we then use an industrial mechanized mixer to guarantee it's thoroughly blended we use a sophisticated depositor to fill our molds precisely and make sure each gummy is the same size so the dosage is uniform next we cool the gummies overnight so they reach the ideal firmness not too chewy or mealy just a nice perfectly soft gummy we coat each gummy and sugar to give it a nice texture and punch of sweetness our customized packaging machine fills the bags with 10 gummies each

cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "ynHOHttNH0o": "[Music] [Applause] so Jalen is going to tell it you what we're making today we are making album baby doggies all right so she's gonna start by mixing 1/4 cup of elderberry syrup into the bowl okay yep and a half quarter cup gelatin into the ball along with it yep and you got to kind of work with this quickly not like you don't want to make a mess with it but you want to stir it kind of closely together it's all mixed we are going to mix the half cup of hot water and which is right here and you want to make sure that it's not boiling water just hot water and then we started with a whole cup of elderberry syrup we are going to take the rest of the other berry syrup and pour it on in with our other a mixture your line makes sure it's blue is it yeah oh it is oh oh they're very sharp it's very expensive yes you wanna make sure you get every drop okay all together [Music] good job and you don't want to spill it cuz it's really expensive after they are all started and your mixture is smooth you're going to want to take your silicon trans which I bought little bears but they have different designs and the new dropper and drop them in up to the top and then you're gonna want to chill in the fridge for about two hours until they Harden then you can enjoy a lot of people just use you know like a bread pan or something there just pour their mixture in there and chill it and then cut it into squares and that works too and when you store these elderberry gummies you can store for up to a week and you're gonna want to put like parchment paper between the layers so they don't stick to each other and things like that but yeah if your child doesn't like just taking it by spoonful with the syrup or I just want a new fun way to make elderberry gummies I already want the benefits off the gelatin this works great so it looks like after 2 hours our little bears are done let's pop one out let's see it so cute all right silence tell me how it tastes good mm-hmm daddy says what's gummy there I hope you enjoyed our video hi

gonna eat all that up and they're gonna get bigger you're gonna expand so you just cover it you put it on the side you can leave it in the fridge you can leave it on the counter whatever you want to do it's the most simple liquid trick to make cuz it's no work you just let it zip you scoop them out and if you look at the size before you did the infusion too after the infusion they are definitely

"tJquc9UyobU": "- ( Collins Key ) This is the largest melted gummy snake turned into sour slime. Three, two, one. You challenge me to melt giant gummy food into edible DIY candy slime\nthat you can actually eat. And so to do this, I got my friend Natalie from Natlie's Outlet over here. She is the queen when it comes to pranks, when it comes to DIY, so\nshe's gonna be helping me out. Today we are making three\ntypes of edible candy slime. The first one is out\nof a giant gummy worm. - The second one is\nwatermelon flavored slime. - And the last one... - Oh. - And for the last one, we are melting this eight foot long giant gummy snake into the sourest candy slime in the world. And then we're gonna eat it. So right now, let's get started. - How to does this work? - Make this super rare slime. First we need to melt\nthe giant gummy worm. So let's do this. - Ready? - Yep. Okay, go towards the bottom. Oh, that looks so cool. We're like burning it. Try to keep it like-- uh-oh. It smells really good though. Alright, it's kinda... - It's catching fire. - Oh yeah, it is on fire. It's starting to drip though. It's starting to drip. Come on, I believe in you. Oh my gosh, there we go. That's a lot of it dripping out. Oh, that's a lot of smoke. Oh, we don't have time for fire alarms. Okay, inside is getting kinda\nburned and kinda charred. If you do this at home be very careful. Make you sure you have\nparental supervision. But it's kinda working a little bit. We are melting the gummy. I'm gonna try this really quick. Just kind of see how it's tasting so far. It taste delicious. - Hmm. - But this is not quite working how I thought it would, because look at this. It's like a crusty mound right... Ow, that's hot. It's working, it's working! Yes, woohoo! - Woohoo! - This is so cool. This literally reminds\nme of when we were doing that liquid metal fidget spinner. The way this thing is melting is crazy. - It's bubbling. So now that we've melted\nit, we're gonna add some cornstarch. Kind of eyeball it and then\nwe're gonna make some slime. - Yeah! I done this before one time\nwhere I accidentally used my hands prematurely. Bad idea. Ah, it's on the back of my hand. No, no, no, no, no. So we're gonna use a spoon for as long as we possibly can to make it. Oh my gosh. It's starting to get\nstringy, so I think we need a little bit more cornstarch. And then we're also gonna\nwant to add a little bit of powdered sugar in. This is how we'll make it taste good. Now we're gonna switch of stirring duties. Not 'cause my arm got tired at all, just because I think it\nwould be great to share. Everyone gets to have a little bit of the experience. These videos are never clean. Ever. So ladies first. I'll let you... Let you do your thing. I'm a gentlemen when it\ncomes to candy slime. I've learned that to have\ngood slime it shouldn't stick to your hands, but\nlike it's stuck to my hands. It's like my hand is sneezing. Oh, there's still more\nslime left in the bowl that has not been mixed yet. Whoa, this spoon is covered. Yo, I've got a new idea for a candy. It's called the sugar spoon. Stick it into powdered sugar... Like the cinnamon challenge. Quick, high five. Oh!\n- Oh! - We're like stuck together now. You know what's missing right now? - What? - Some nerds. Alright, so we're gonna add some nerds in what's going on. - Woo, party. - Yo this is so... (Collin sneezes) - Ew. - This looks so, so cool. 'Cause now it's not only candy slime, but now there's like\nthis little bumps here where you can see the nerds. - So you wanna taste it? - I think yeah, it's time to taste it. But first, I have a challenge. I want to see can you\nsubscribe to this channel, turn on the channel post notificatoins, and give this video a thumbs up. Seven seconds, here we go. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Done. If you can do that, comment down below. Keyper Squad right now. So now for the taste test, you ready? I'm gonna go for a giant chomp. Here we go. Three, two, one. - Crunchy, slimy. Every kid's dream. - It taste delicious. - Kinda tastes like gum. Wow, Collin. - Let's melt this watermelon. - Woo!\n- Woo! That was very unsafe. - Yeah, it was. It was a little too close to my face. We're gonna be doing the hot knife versus the gummy to melt it. We're gonna give this a shot right now. So first. Let's heat it up. It's glowing. There we go. Three, two, one. Let's see if this works. - There goes. - Yo, it's working! Oh no! No, no, it's so smokey! Oh gosh no, what've we done? It smells delicious, yet very toxic. It's working, there we go. It's almost like slicing off the gummy. Yes! Yes! Yes! I've got a new start\nthis time guys, though. Watch out. Gonna slice it off. - [Natalie] You should\nslowly slice it off. - Yo, I wonder if you can\nslice right through it? Get so smokey so quick. Yo, but it's actually melting it, guys. The way I'm holding\nthis, this flamethrower in my face is not a good idea. I'm just like... Well without smoking up the entire house, I think we're gonna pop this one again in the microwave, but this actually works. Like this actually melted. The hot knife was\ndefinitely a better strat than just the blowtorch. So right now, pop it in\nthe microwave and let's go. What started off looking nice and pretty, and now it's just kinda... It looks like grease or like an oil. - Pour some in. - Let's do it. - Slime. - Slime! Whip it, flip it, sauce boy! YO, this looks so nasty, fam. - Ew, it looks like hairball. - I was going somewhere else with it. I'm like this doesn't\nlook like a watermelon. It looks like peanut butter. Go away. Alright, so now we're gonna pick it up with our hands and go... Oh my gosh! I got it on my shirt. Aw well, that's part of it. But now I have an edible candy shirt. - You've got skills. - Yo, this looks like a\nmakeup that you would put on. Like it looks like a foundation. - Wanna pour some on? - I'm good. One more step to make sure it's the ultimate watermelon gummy. - What about me? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Collin share. - I think mine are just\nkinda disengrating. Hers look really pretty, and then look what happened to mine. Mine just kinda splattered everywhere. It's definitely turning red now. So we didn't have the color before, we definitely have the color now. Oh man. So let's see if this actually tastes like a real watermelon gummy. And if you wanna see me do a whole bunch of crazy DIY's and experiments live every single Saturday, 1\nPM Pacific Standard Time, I'm partnering with\nLive Me as summer long. So yeah, the download link is\ndown in the description below. Come join, it's free, it's superfun. Tell your friends and also\ncomment what should we do on our livestreams, 'cause\nwe're gonna be doing literally whatever you want. So right now, you ready to try this? Here we go guys. Three, two, one. Ho, ho, it's stuck to my teeth. Alright, so final verdict on this. What are your thoughts? - I don't like it. - Yeah, I thought it was good at first, and then I started tasting\nall of the corn starch, and that really is terrible. So right now, we've been\nmelting the eight foot gummy snake into the sour\ngummy slime in the world. Let's go. This is literally an eight foot gummy. Oh my gosh. It's so heavy. It's like 20 something pounds. It's almost like it weighs 30 pounds. We're gonna make it sour. We also need the bucket. Alright, so I think I\nhad it for like a second. Can we get the bucket? You're gonna take the snake... Ow. It smacked me in the face. Where'd the eyeball go? Ah. I want the other eyeball though. I want to try this. - Good? It's so heavy. - Use your muscles. (Collin and Natalie cheer) - This is so cool. Fashion is my passion, but I'm gonna release my scarf now. Almost fell over. I wonder what it's gonna taste like. - It's lipstick. - What? You wanna try to hold this thing? - Yeah. Oh. - That was like choking me. Because this is eight\nfeet long, we can't pop it in the microwave. So now, we're making our own microwave. You know what, what I think we're gonna do is let's just chop it up,\npop it in the microwave, and then put it back in here. Because there's no way\nwe can melt this down. - Cheers!\n- Cheers! Oh my gosh. There we go. Oh jeez, oh. Alright here we go. Time to make some... Yo, that was a powerful mix. - Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir. - This one is going to need\na lot more corn starch, because right now you can\ntell it's super, super gummy. Oh my gosh, she got it all over me. It looks like a bizarre\nalien substance for real. - Yay! Now we can do this. Now the corn starch won't get in my nose. - Yo, this stuff looks crazy. You good? - Yeah. No, I really can't breathe. I can't see. - I think this slime\nis getting pretty good. And now we're gonna\nadd the sour candy into what's going on. So right now... What kind of a sound was that? We're doing a lightning\nround with the sour candy, and to kick it off, this is Cry Baby Soda. - I never had that. - I've never had it either. So you have to bite off\nthe top of it, apparently. It's like wax. Cheers.\n- Cheers. Oops. I missed my mouth. Eww! That's sour. - Next up, toxic waste. Cheers! I've got some Warhead Chewie Cubes. We got like two left. - [Natalie] I never had these. - They're sour, but not too bad. - Yummy. - Got this, I don't know what this is. Oh, it's like a roll? Three, two, one. Oh no. - Are these like Pop Rocks? Yeah, sour power. Alright, here we go. Sprinkle a little bit of\n'em in here, and then... Holy cow! Alright, I think we got\nsome of this stuff here. I don't know what this is. Looks like some spray stuff. You like that? (Natalie screams) - It's in my nose. It burns. - Yo guys, so we're adding some malic acid and she wants to try this stuff. - I'll do it for the Keyper Squad. - You got it. Before you try it, guys\nwe also filmed a video on her channel where we made slime. It's as crazy as it sounds. The link is down in the description below. So go check it out, go\nsubscribe to her channel. Give her video a thumbs up\nand comment Keyper Squad. Oh! Yo, I told you this stuff is crazy! - My tongue, my tongue, my tongue. It's still going! - It's still going? Alright, we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this quick. We'll sprinkle the malic acid. That's so much! That sour stuff is so intense. It's so intense. There's so much malic acid everywhere. This is the largest melted gummy snake turned into sour slime. We're about to eat it right now. But comment down below\nwhat's another giant gummy something that I\nshould melt into candy slime. But right now, you ready for this? - Yep. - Here we go. Three, oh-no, two, one. (Collin and Natalie yell) (Collin mumbles) Okay, bye! It's not a joke. It's not a... It's not a joke. You're like, \"Yeah I'll give this a shot.\" I'm like, \"Fam!\"", "gRahhO7E9Rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah B and welcome to the haze today we were gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had obviously Medicaid they come in these little packets so this is a 200 milligrams so these guys are each 50 there's four of them and they taste they taste like they taste familiar but they are so good I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only compare them because they're both gummies these you will find much cheaper again my name is Sarah P thank you so much for watching the channel the haze and again this is your guys who have cannabis infused lifestyle there's gonna be more videos different hoes so I hope you guys enjoy it please leave a comment below please hit that like button please share and I hope you have the agreement [Music]", "gvzv07w2RY0": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy jack reviewing the Camino gummies here the wild berry indica five milligrams a pop I've already enjoyed I think let's see how much I got left one two three four five six seven eight eight left it's 40 milligrams I have enjoyed 60 milligrams and I've taken those at night this is a nice indica helped me to sleep let's see I think the first time no each time I had six for my head seven either way I've taken 25 to 35 milligrams and I feel it's consistent it's good I do recommend the Camino I recommend all Cuba products they deliver potencies their flavor is phenomenal they do that they nail that however when I buy again personally we're good look at this that's a fair amount of gummies one two three four five six seven eight here a lot at eight oh yeah I think I did actually anyway that's a fair amount of gummies to eat but that being said everybody's tolerance is a little different you know my tolerance is less than some more than others I know people who can eat a lot more edibles than me I know people that if they had half to a quarter of this they would get late and probably fall asleep so with all these edible reviews this isn't me talking my experience is how much I take what works for me the most important thing you can do for yourself is experimentally but you know take a couple see if it works that's what I did at first now I know my sweet spot is like 20 to 30 ish depending what I'm doing if I just want a nice little kick nice little feel calm down I have to but right now I'm go for two for five that's thirty milligrams of delicious wildberry indica it reminds me of those Welsh's fruit snacks the wild berry ones I don't know if you've had those flavor is really good I really like their packaging too on this one especially got like a pink Scott pink outdoors got like water running trees it's supposed to transport you to what did I say California state of mind overall five stars because it's a legit product but personally I don't know if I'll buy again just because I have other edibles I like a little more nothing against them I'm definitely gonna get the sativa however I think it's like a pineapple habanero something like that maybe the mango habanero something with some spice in there which I'm excited to try because I love spice I love mixing sweet and spice but I'm going too long here I'm gonna come back to you in about an hour and a half talk to you when uh these indicus kicked in I will label Oh get ready for bed and I'll see you guys okay so I'm gonna be completely transparent here with you I didn't take six of these last night lay down with my girl watch black mirror if you haven't seen that show it's pretty badass anyway I've even finished the episode and I knocked out after six of these it was like a 15 hour work dad maybe that play part in it but like I said the previous two times I've had the you know 25 to 30 it did the trick it mellowed me out i chilled for a while the hay woke up ready to get it feeling great today got a couple truebloods meetings one for the true buds tank top I am excited about and then another one with a local cannabis company and I don't want to save their name because we haven't really committed to anything but should have some fun videos coming through that soon I'll catch you guys on the next one I do give this five stars I do highly recommend it and maybe pass out got Java that's what I want with an indica especially if I'm eating it late at night like Sam I get ready for bed I didn't think I was actually gonna fall asleep and go to bed but it happened it happens when I take it to you I'll stay up I'll make sure to stay up and give you a full review on that one yeah camino a wild berries and i like how for the effect it says chill I feel that the Camino truly encompasses that chill factor just like you it's actually turning in I'll see you on the next one coming at you yeah this is worse than Mary Jane I we ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it and the cutter sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed", "MZrK0P33TWI": "what does Arkana fam and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys so check it out for this video right here I have some more edibles alright so these are the drops these are lime drops and these are 50 milligrams of THC each I got two of them so we got 100 milligrams total which I already know I already know some of you me be viewing this like hundred grams as [ __ ] that's just done a lot that's weak sauce yeah okay I agree with you but really quick just to let everybody know 50 grams is the limit here on our edibles in the state of Oregon okay so if your recreational 21 and up you have a limit of 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy you know five six seven of these you know what I mean but you're still limited to 50 milligrams and it's kind of rather expensive to be honest for just 50 okay I mean these were like 6 or 7 bucks a box for just 50 milligrams you know what I mean so you can see how that kind of adds up alright but anyway so these are a lime jelly okay both of these are a lime jelly and I believe they're just bite size let's see here a point or 0.8 percent or whatever 0.8 grams percent grams of sugar and no fats no no cool all right lime essential oil oil and cannabis extract and cannabis deprived terpenes okay okay this is balanced okay so right here let's see if I can show you guys this better right there they tell you the so if you just take one of those little slivers out of this that's five milligrams so if you're trying to dose yourself out they got a little dosage chart right there as soon as you open it up so you can get ten servings you can cut out of this five milligrams each serving okay for a total of 50 milligrams all right I don't know why I keep saying balanced on there it says balanced balanced like what the [ __ ] okay great you're balanced I'm not at least I'll try not to be here we go [Music] [Music] super line like super lime like holy [ __ ] that is a rush of lime flavor it's very nice it's got this covered in sugar so the code of sugar really adds to it it tastes great it nice and soft it's not like a hard gummy I like it this is a vegan product it does say vegan right there so if you are somebody that is vegan this is going to work perfect for you okay [Music] hmm you kind of get that taste of cannabis right there at the end the aftertaste you can you definitely taste a little smidgen of weed in there but overall it's got a nice flavor it tastes really good it tastes just like a candy I mean it tastes like a lime gummy candy and it's really good it's not bad um I actually like this product I actually like it I'll give it a thumbs up I give it a definite thumbs up I would definitely recommend it and the reason I recommend it is because you here in Oregon since it's 50 milligrams for each meaning if you want more you got to buy more so when you're buying more if you're buying ones that are like huge chunks of candy or huge chunks of chocolate or whatever the [ __ ] that's a lot of sugar that you have to [ __ ] intake just to get the milligrams that you need okay or what that's crazy okay I'm not trying to be diabetic so the fact that it's bite-sized the fact that it's just one little quick all right and I got my full 50 milligrams that's awesome I love that alright so let me know about your guys's opinions on the drop here let me I dropped it let me pick up the drop on the drop alright drops cannabis jellies that's that's the name of this company be sure to check out the drops cannabis jellies if you've ever had this

y'all was going to ask we are going to make what that's what happens when you don't practice we're gonna practice videos ready now let's pretend to practice ready you guys on the count of three we're gonna say edible gummy slime one two three that's you should probably youtubers do so what we have here is the leftovers of our chases corner gummy vs. real video part three if you haven't watched that one go watch it first so we you don't spoil the gummies and fun that we had on that channel go watch the first thing come back hey we'll see you later and you probably watched it by now so what we're gonna do is do it a little bit interesting this time frame here we've got this shark bite game there's some fish and lobster right here we're going to pick one out and whichever one that we pick out that causes this shark to that's the color of the gummy we will make our first batch with sound gun now might sell it oh well that's kind of cool but really here's why it's nasty because if we get green this is pickle and the green pickle tastes like pickle yes the green pickle tastes like pickle and this red bacon tastes like thank you Cherry's bacon chili bacon we're missing one of these guys there but that's alright and since we don't have blue we put blue tape on two of the green ones you go first chase you ready you go fishing I'm going now doesn't matter which one you choose well you got two it matters which one bites at you mommy do you want to take a turn okay the thing is is we don't know which color is gonna trigger it bad boy all right so I got a yellow fish that means I chase got it so you can pick I think I would go with melania for this first batch we're just using one cup of gummies all right we got all the black let's reset this shark by Chase is going first safe

panic now no that's not what I was gonna say look at that guy's that is pure gummy Comenius powdered sugar which is also known as sugar icing and cornstarch two tablespoons of cornstarch two tablespoons of powdered sugar but slowly we have to mix this in so who wants to be the mixer okay slowly start to mix in both go ahead or fastly yeah let's do it fast Li and now mix mix it mix it mix it the more the powder sugar and cornstarch you used the less sticky it'll be but it'll be more stretchy if it is really sticky you just add more cornstarch and more powdered sugar but then that means it'll be less stretchy to make it more stretchier you add one teaspoon of coconut oil this has had a little more powdered sugar and a little moko stop now we're going to add in Foca nut oil with the alignment yes it's obvious that you need stickiness test mmm that looks really sticky chase you try yeah oh no that's too sticky does it taste good like a melted pink starburst oh yeah we're gonna keep adding more powdered sugar I guess this recipe we read is wrong I had a whole bunch go sing a mixing song and mix the chocolate it's doughy I got a cousin named Oh week oh that's Joey Joey bag of

about seven brothers so I thought I'd bring my sister so keep watching and you'll meet her it's a good time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hi and welcome to the happiest this is a show about him yesterday welcome to the happiest this is a show about how they services under the happiest the show about half welcome to the happiest a show about today we have a guest and her name is Molly so we're just gonna hey what's up at walking to the hunkiest a show about sisters just kidding it's a show about hemp today I have my cute little sister on Molly look at her stare at her get inside get in there get real in the mean get to lean in there today on this awesome edition of summer plus one we have again Molly cotton in the house and we also decided we should do a live review of a product we both haven't tried called Charlotte's Web spin that way web anyway today we're gonna be talking about Charlotte's Web we're viewing it together why don't you just give a brief about your CB experience how do you share about it it will be pretty brief I guess I don't have much experience there's obviously like CBD breweries everywhere there's like CBD oil Barney would probably have been wearing live I live in Portland Oregon so she's a hipster yeah so it's everywhere basically and I do like it I feel like THC may not necessarily be for everyone but CBD can be for everyone totally so well this is a show about him we do it all here people done my research here on Charlotte's Web it's seven brothers that came together they were already in the hemp in the hemp industry already further uncle and then wait hold on let me verify they were inspired by a little girl is what they say yeah but that's later that's latter first they were inspired by their uncle and then they were inspired by a little girl and then they were inspired by us alright so in 2008 the seven brothers had an uncle who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and then in 2011 there was a young girl named Charlotte and she had she suffers from a ton of seizures and epilepsy and now she has less seizures mm-hmm so that's the story seven brothers can you imagine popping out seven boys you're like [ __ ] when ye obviously honestly oh we have a ton of something yeah but here's the funny part my mom accidentally named us a bunch of em names except for me and our youngest sibling Lily but not on purpose this woman if she accidentally named six children with a J name and the last one has an a name I mean no I'm no model I do they look the same they literally dress the same in the photos that they upload to the internet like by choice thanks yous they're like let's all wear the same sandals Aggie blue jeans and white t-shirt there and that's our header it's not just also can we mention that's not just on the internet that's their header for their website let them be brothers love the dress alike I mean yeah I guess like don't you want it people are just you like don't hate on people who you know family but it's but we're sisters it's fine it's fine it's fine so you guys are saying that you've never taken a picture with white shirts and sandals with your whole family we didn't occupy Oh stay tuned people hold on I ever verify Wow let me see this I mean honestly though like okay just to defend you you're a kid in this picture cute so these four chrome hasser bowls I know it's charging I'm sorry it's very different moving on let's chat about this one first shall we this is your lemon lime flavor it's calm gonna make a calm let's see what's in it exactly let's read about it throws web comb gum these are packed with lemon balm LC + 9 + x naturally occurring and beneficial Saito can of cannabinoids ingredients quite quite a few tapioca syrup beet sugar from 2 language fella in addition to that there's water natural flavours MCT oil packed in less than 1% Maalik acid spirulina extract sodium citrate dioxide organic lemon juice concentrate citric acid organic sunflower lecithin and tapioca starch what do you this one is recovery its flavor is ginger it has basically what this one is supposed to do what they say is that it relieves joint tension and moderate connective tissue pain resulting from normal exercise and activity so maybe like after the gym or a walk or a paddleboard or an encounter I don't know it sounds like tapioca syrup beet sugar fruit or whatever right that's our water mc2 oil-packed in natural flavors so it kind of sounds like they have like the same like they have the same amount of kind of extract they have the same amount of each tumeric and ginger is what they're saying this this puppy is all about so basically like regardless of which one you take you're going to be getting the same amount of cannabis EVD yeah CBD but there's different additives in each one and that's the difference this one is rather asleep baby tell me how to go to sleep raspberry flavored has melatonin some people love that some people don't I will mention it only has 3 milligrams to gummies every 30 minutes this one is over 30 minutes no no your life I want to sleep forever that's going to bed you said you alarmed calls for the other one because you're so stressed out cuz you're tired should we try it I'm gonna take can I get a spit Cup here we go alright fine I'm gonna try this one first no oh here we go okay I'm trying so that's why with you so we have like honest opinion no it's not it not for me what's wonder do you think that's wrong so we're in same one wait open around oh I'm at red again okay so it definitely tastes like weed heavily there's a lot of weight over time at all yes it does oh it does it definitely basically it really does it taste like raspberry and wheat I taste like raspberry and weed for sure I chewed my [ __ ] up I soaked on it I took a first swim you know not for me personally because what do you think about the consistency good good question well I like here's what I will say about it I don't like when they sugarcoat dummies for cvd I'm not a fan of that so I like it wasn't coded I think that it kind of tastes like one of those like like gummies that are trying to be like organic and healthier so they don't have like that quite right of a chew and they kind of have that like - that's a little bit off I think that's what these shoes are like this does taste like rabbit right it does taste like rye berry that's for sure it's all very taste like snozzberries but also like okay maybe it's just for me who doesn't have like we gummies very often like maybe for you you don't think it tastes like weed because you've had things that do really like weed but just to me I definitely taste the wheat flavor like if you don't have a lot of experience with eating CBD products or hemp products like it tastes like weed it just does beautiful truth time to recover from that one time director so I guess we're gonna take this every time my brother I wonder what the manufacturing process is like a lot of moles of it for me Wow I can [ __ ] anything bad I said about the raspberry Oh Travis that's one thing you said you were like oh I'm gonna be careful not to eat all of these so let's oh wait we didn't even snow hold up first important let me go back to this one smell is it smells a little weird but whatever this one no it does not taste like ginger it tastes like ginger second-cousin removed and kicked out of the state I don't even give it a second drop like a piece of mango and I don't know why like do you get some no little anymore you can't make me that's bar sitting on top Nast alright out of ten gross sorry I mean this is a real reviews from real people sure - I have lemon lime calm let's calm down you know say comes natural I'm gonna throw your zoomer Matthew throw one of mine here we go wash at the same time yeah like what OK ROCK white no I want to say before I start shooting this I want to like this one so I'm gonna hope that I do cuz I don't want to be a hater oh not for me wait again I mean yeah better gummies I have to yeah I've had better gummies in this I'm sorry you know make a web elsewhere you're not gonna catch me player I'm outta here I'm not gonna a ninth-grade hole the first time I ever had weed some guy sold me weed gum and literally all it was is he poked a nug into this piece of gum and I didn't know like what nothing was at the time so I just thought that's what it was truly and I literally gave him $5.00 took a drink passing period and I literally just chewed up this mug that's what it tastes like with dumb in it and like this is straight-up bringing me back to that like literally I'm standing through time not a good one okay you know I don't think that's what their goal was but I felt into that so that is something she's triggered people trigger she's triggered literally the first time like that was crazy and this literally just I forgot about that completely Wow see nice and smells can really do that to my old what would you say your overall review is Molly my guest of all time I mean I like the look of it I like the flavors that they are advertising what I say that's what they actually are flavored like not necessarily absolutely not not close would I say that I like the idea of it yes what I say that I like it again not necessary I would read gift.this 920 21 year 10 milligrams like is that a lot is that a little is very little that's a little it's not a lot so to having two of these that's a little yeah you can probably smash out ten and be fine don't do that so like a person who let's say like has CBD on the regular would they even feel ten milligrams that's a great question Molly that's an absolute great question I pray if I was smashing down CBD on a regular base yes I would 1000% take a few just seven well because for ten milligrams is two of these I took 35 minutes what's up o2 is 10x house are we having me do our own math why I'm not a mathematician tell me how much is in your total most companies do I don't understand why you're not telling me no exactly I don't know if it's full spectrum I don't know if it's broad I don't know if it's isolate give me your stuff what started with the research so like okay so what are we writing some flavor cuz that's not good Jase that's not good if this will get you high don't know cuz I can't figure it out because this is confusing I'm gonna take a recovery cuz I'm kind of getting sick so oh yeah it's just whatever the blend is is there yeah it's the only difference in there anyway I don't I just want to smell a little weird in the ground on you guys no let's smell this it's not what it says it is but I just don't like it tastes very artificial I'm hot gummies that are actually good I know what I'm personally not a fan I'm sorry Mariah sorry disgusting and I think you feel the same way little sister yeah I would say if you're just looking for something that like you are going to want to take every day this may not be it because like what I take this if I need it to sure if you have gag reflexes don't take it I think you do realize the good funny because it's true what's the difference with this CBD versus that like is there different CBDs are these the same CBDs in this one is you know what they're a non although their website is confusing like I just don't like if I were to just or say I like someone who didn't really know exactly what they were wearing where's that where's the third party lab test where is it at I'm I'd like to know is this full spectrum is abroad yeah coming in tonight is someone who doesn't know like a lot about CVD like getting this if I were to just like order a box because I was like referred to it like I would have known I mean I would have no idea what to do this honestly like what I mean what is what what is this really you know if I were to eat one of these it would be for pure medical reasons not because I like the taste you know when you're a kid you're like let me get a vitamin you eat like 17 behind your dad's back that's not happening here you're not eating 17 eggs behind anyone's back I know it's a really popular really popular company yeah and I know that they have a lot of products and they're raved about cuz they're feeling it and they're doing the thing and this is only the first thing I've tried from them personally it's based on taste I'm not feeling the vibe that's me what these gummies that's cuz that's all we've tried so far the gummies are not for us it's not for me yeah for me and like it was just really hard to find any information honestly ladies don't tell me anything nothing and I had to go onto their website to finally find out if they're like full-spectrum or broad spectrum yeah whatever wait what are you and like every finally their website just tells me generally that their stuff is but it specifically say Charlotte's Web produce products are made from high-quality and proprietary strains of whole plant hemp extracts containing a full spectrum of phyto cannabinoids including CBD Charlotte's Web products meet arcs or exceed industry standards for purity and are tested both in-house and by major independent third-party laboratory where I do where show me the facts just say show me the receipts in this way we can create the highest quality products in the industry direct only from family farms in the US now imported hemp or hemp extracts so like a little bit of like this is what we do but like find out well you know what I mean like it's just a lot of research like I just like to like order something and feel confident that they're gonna tell me what's going on and I'm not gonna have to go into like all this research because people want to know what they're putting in their body with you know 100% yeah also they want to taste good I was a little wet down I guess and they got stocks because they got sucks they got revenue growth it up pink oh they got a bankroll but I'm telling you what financial highlights is what they're brought out of right now I would not buy this again I was really hoping I was gonna like this sofa red no thought I was kind of excited I mean it would be cool to do like a more elaborate tastic with a sleep one pop a few like say if they do what they say yeah I would be maybe maybe what I should say I should I should correct my review taste-wise not for me maybe they work though but I spit them out this one just says take two gummies once per day like how long would it take effect how long would it be before the question refer to my other video link in the bio ok if you want to buy this specific gummy package that we bought the variety pack it is on sale for 131 98 original price is 164 97 if you were going to buy them individually they are 50 $4.99 which hit me with some math is about like 91 or 92 cents I got me like a little awesome dollar a gummy they suggest two gummies so that would be about two hours a day yeah which unless you need more which depending on your dosage right you could need more yeah don't you do less hey subscribe right now and we'll mail you a sticker so that would call even sign it that's really cute I really like them you can put them on your hydros you can put them on your coffee cups you can put you on a sticker send me an email summer at the hem peace calm

cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank

below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "ZFqi1V9GMkI": "The following program contains mature subject matter viewer discretion is advised as more states to legalize marijuana more and more people are eating up edible pot products people in California alone consume more than 180 million dollars worth of marijuana infused food and drinks in 2016 half of that was consumed by our audience Because people want to make light of these things but gummy bears cookies they may appear completely harmless But some are finding the exact opposite to be true, so About a month ago. I was helping a friend paint her apartment, and it's hot March and I decide what does she have in her refrigerator? So I opened her fridge. I look down I go And I didn't have all my readers and so I grab a glass and I pour myself a little bit For another toss the bottle go back sit down. I realize that I'm extremely tired So I'm like ok I need it, but as I start to walk towards the door to get air I realize I can't walk I'm wobbling I'm swerving the walls are moving. I'm like what hey I'm taking a deep breath. It's getting worse and it's getting worse then I thought oh My god am I having a stroke So I jump up I run to the mirror to see if my face was distorted And then I couldn't take it anymore. I go lie down. I'm holding on to a pillow. She had I Wake up the next morning and my friend comes in the room and she goes hey Did you see a lemonade in my refrigerator and I said? Yeah, I did. Well. Do you know where it is? Yeah? I drank it You drink my cannabis Has Cannabis lemonade I mean it's a beautiful bottle and had a lemon on the front of it I thought it was a mint leaves on the blimmin Did you drink the entire thing and I said yeah? I did she said you do realize that that was four servings in one bottle Our colleague our friend Terry joins You can make you I mean, how are you hi first of all from that bottle of lemonade I'm still high Your story really highlights what a problem this is with edibles because when you have drinks They go in your mouth or absorb the cannabis is absorbed there as well as in your stomach It's really hard to know how much you're ingesting him. I didn't even know there was drinkable Did you? Think Colorado is banning the gummy bears and these edible candies. They're like because because they're so confusing and there's been a 45% increase in the number of ER visits between 2014 and 2016 Okay, so I'm imagine a scenario kid goes in that fridge you had no idea did it taste did it have that little bit of A marijuana taste to it. No it's delicious How many days do you felt normal excuse me? No, I think I felt high for about 24 hours okay, and I felt exhausted Because it really beats you up. It beat me up Yeah Is there an answer beyond? There are now all these products out there that claim that if you've taken maybe too much it can help you come down. There's the easy There me can't relief. There's no good evidence I think that that these kinds of things really work But this was an interesting one, and I like the reasoning behind it, but smelling pepper That somehow it interacts with your cannabinoid receptors and can help offset some of that feeling of being high I mean why not try it Terry you want to give it a whirl The ideas that that black pepper paint something called carry aa saline which is a terpene it binds the same THC receptor and therefore can bring you down and make you feel less high and less and less and toxic I don't know Yeah It's marijuana one week and huffing the next come on Terry. No it's look you just have to be careful when you're in someone else's home I Don't just randomly go in and start drinking things or eating things you never know. I'll remember that Terry Terry learned a lesson. Thanks You", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "WKDxAHgCcUw": "g'day welcome to todd's kitchen i've made a number of gummy recipes in the past they're all delicious all easy but they're not exactly keto so we can still have our gummy and eater too if you're on a keto diet so join me today as make my version of keto gummies now these keto gummies are ridiculously simple you just need two ingredients or three if you cut the water so the first one bean and this is the most important one for that gummy consistency is gelatine powder now this is what turns normal jello into a gummy consistency so i've got two cups of warm water so i'm going to add about two tablespoons of our gelatine mixture and we're just going to let that gelatin soak up all that water so just now that's all dissolved i'm just gonna give it a quick stir just to combine and now for the flavor i'm going to use some sugar-free jello now this just makes it far easier but if you don't have sugar-free jello just add some flavoring and say a little bit of stevia for sweetness so into our warm water i'm just going to pour in our sugar-free jello and just give it a good stir until it's completely dissolved okay so lastly i've just got a gummy mould now you can find these in most shops so it obviously makes no difference which one to use and just simply going to pour our mixture into each gummy mold [Music] okay so once you've filled up all your gummy moulds simply place it in the fridge for a good one or two hours to completely set now gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours so it's just a simple matter of removing them from our molds and look at that one delicious keto friendly gummy bear and there we have some delicious keto gummy bears now i've also made gummy worms gummy bottles gummy rings so this is certainly a very versatile recipe you can use any mold that you like any flavor that you like and it's completely healthy no sugar no carbs so whether you're making gummy bears or some delicious gummy worms either way they're going to taste simply [Music] delish [Music] you", "6O5gl_8aTOc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you",

get to see the edibles here they look like candy and you know you could probably just take half of one or maybe a whole one but that's what they look like they smell kind of like a pomegranate they

intoxicating effects is thought to date back thousands of years in Eastern cultures marijuana can be consumed in many different ways in this video we will be looking at the difference between smoking and edibles uses that smoke marijuana place it into a cigarette containing tobacco this is known as a joint or smoke it through a bong or use a hollowed-out cigar called a blunt when smoking the psychoactive compound THC is gratitude Delta 9 THC which binds to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain causing constant stimulation of neurons quite like a pinball machine during smoking THC is rapidly absorbed from the lungs into the blood circulation from there it crosses the blood-brain barrier smoking gives a faster high because of this however has a shorter duration when compared with edibles when making edibles aka space cakes THC is dissolved into fats such as butter due to its lipophilic properties the THC is once again converted to Delta 9 THC due to the heat applied when cooking achieving the high when taking edibles usually takes much longer from anywhere between thirty minutes to two hours this is because the drug is absorbed by the girl and then processed by the liver in the liver the Delta 9 THC is converted to 11 o H THC this chemical is highly potent and has a higher affinity for the cannabinoid receptors in the brain therefore giving a stronger and longer high when consuming edibles there are many other factors that affect a person's high such as the strain of cannabis use the quantity and the person's history such as mental health and previous drug experiences however it is often a lot harder to predict how high you will get when on edibles due to the change in potency of the THC chemical luckily enough marijuana is not toxic so there won't be any long-term side effects or chances of an overdose just the potential going on a bad trip if you're not careful thanks for watching don't forget to Like comment and subscribe you", "pUB2EPLShGw":

more I've been saving this for a rainy day I guess literally it will be a rainy day I got this leaf eater edible I showed these a while back when I god I'm like couple weeks ago I got 80 grams per gummy milligrams for going so let's hope this helps out it's definitely a different flavor to check in later and let you guys know what I feel see if it hits me as well as any of the edibles I make for myself it's how I judge everything because those things always have me [ __ ] good I gotta go finish work I'll check on one of the old idle poos alright I'm back with a quick update it is right around almost three hours since I took the leaf-eater 80-milligram cannabis gummy bear whatever a gummy [ __ ] thing they have and quite honestly I don't feel I would smoked I haven't done anything since the first part of this video about the smoked my last bowl will weed that I have until like two hours from now the last bowl will call it a wrap on this video just another edible that I've gotten from a dispensary or cannabis edible company and they're just garbage I've had one gummy bear that rocked me I felt good off of it for like five six hours and other than that it's really only done the edibles that I make that I've ever felt so I don't know what the difference was once I made for myself work every time yet I've had one experience with other people's edibles of done anything for me so guess I gotta keep looking for [ __ ] better edibles I mean there's tons of different local companies around so I'm sure this ones out there that can do the job I've got to come across them that's what I like to do when I take edibles too is I like to just eat it and see where it goes from that well you're not three hours into it if you're not really here or not I mean I'm probably not going to I mean it's not like the mescaline I took six hours later I wasn't feeling it so I took this [ __ ] six hours later me and my friends were all like this is a bunch of garbage I'm like I'm going home [ __ ] this blah blah blah I go home I trip balls with this wicked intense body trip for like 5 out was alone in my bed just like tensing up effect and releasing and like taunting up and

sour patch kids the watermelon candies this is exactly what it tastes like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this product is almost a perfect product you know no gelatin made with pectin it does say distillate on it i think this is a 9.75 for me out of 10.", "aoyIq7L-_lk": "[Music] hi everyone jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com i got my boy brandon here a consumer of cannabis living in los angeles from the greater seattle area right yes that accurate yeah we like to say hi so i wanted to include multiple types of guests in the west coast we tour because to give not only someone who's a seasoned smoker season with these products like a perspective but i wanted to share someone who's not only new to the area but very experienced in the world of cannabis consumption right so today we've got a product we're gonna review it it's a one bite talk about it finish the edible score out of ten review we've got the emerald sky sour watermelon gummies are you ready yeah i'm ready uh as if i smoke a lot of weed a lot of dabs i don't do that ever so these are gonna have to be really really hot i think i think they're pre-packaged in a small little individual baggie on the inside so we've got to figure out how to get in first we got in so it's definitely not child proof all right uh they are pre-packaged as you can see what do we got here they look like these little uh what's it called hi chews you ever had the high chew cake it does have the high chew pack like a little hi-chew candy so keep these away from kids so it says that on the packaging it says the benevolent bear so the legend goes that deep within the ancient forest just beyond the bend where the river runs high and the wind whisps i gotta read this whole thing all right here we go and the wind whisks through the emerald canopy a path widens as it arrives upon a place a valley full of sun and whispers of secrets there the heart of the universe resides great teacher benevolent bear gatherer of treasures the knowing one who goes by the name of cirrus he guides us to the way beyond through the harvest that reveals and enlightens and feeds us from within as we roam freely and enchanted curious and sublime towards a more blissful and beautiful world and then our team emerald sky brings together our 25 years of candy making experience with the vision of infusing time-honored confessions with the world class at cannabis extract we are dedicated to an uncompromising standard of quality flavor and potency and all our handcrafted thc infused confections all right that is so much text in your packaging it's a novelty wow that was crazy i wonder what kind of candy they were making before well that's okay let's go over that what kind of candy are they making here's the ingredients glucose syrup sugar gelatin oh yeah they're making sorbitol citric acid malic acid carnivore wax palm kernel oil tartaric acid natural watermelon flavor oh i thought it said beef extract for a second it says beet with a tea cannabis extract it does say an allergen warning which is i feel like that's helpful some people definitely probably gonna make my throat feel made um equipment that processes my throat really you have a slight allergy to maybe gelatin probably oh all right here we go it out oh they're squishy how many milligrams is it uh 100 milligrams 10 milligram a yeah and gluten free oh let's check the testing real quick is it actually don't you go ahead and bite it just test it let them know it doesn't have the potency on this it's very very tasty it does taste exactly like sour watermen those are really it's not really sour it could be a little bit more sour so it's got this little um definitely nice little gummy it's like a grapefruit juice color that's pretty good yeah oh we supposed to be taking them one by one right that was uh that's pretty tasty i'm not gonna lie yeah tastes like most gummies that i usually eat no definitely not salad but yeah i said definitely not sour they could it definitely watermelon there's no celery definitely no doubt about it yeah there's no sour in it for sure no size four out of ten uh i say about seven just only because why why you give them seven i give them a seven due to it's just i don't know like there's just no sour to it and they call it sour watermelon it's hard to be in the watermelon sour category yeah exactly exactly when there's no sour too there's no sour kit when you give it to me like that i gotta agree with you i think it's closer to a seven than what i was gonna get before well i'm gonna land at a seven as well pair up with you there i think this long s information up on the top and it doesn't have the potency information like all other edibles i want to know how much thc is in this just because 100 milligrams in the bag doesn't necessarily mean that there's 100 milligrams actually in here that needs to be on here [Music] um it's definitely not sour so there's that and i feel like the fact that this is packaged in plastic and then packaging more plastic is killing it yeah it's wasted super easy so that's very wasteful and then there's just honestly there's just sugar everywhere so i mean it made a giant mess so i appreciate you guys we're gonna end here with sevens from both of us yeah brandon's first first review with us here so we'll get him on some other ones see if we can't get him on some fire products but uh sour watermelons from emerald sky tasted good yeah that was pretty good not sour it's it's good candy but it's just not not a sour watermelon and it is what it is at that point so west coast we tour we got more reviews coming make sure you tap in subscribe like follow talk some if you need to do it appreciate you guys follow up [Music] peace [Music] me you", "eH_jmUD6H3M": "load up me to back out here with another review another edible review so this time I got some gummies this stuff is from Aurora Aurora drift these ones are their raspberry gummies I personally fan of indica I only get indica either a gummies concentrates flower hash anything like that I normally go for indigo this stuff is sativa I don't know sounds like we're all stuck together they're five per container two milligrams each which is hilarious but again not everybody has a tolerance that in every day user does so they're trying to keep for people freaking out and overdoing it overdosing and other people call it which technically you're giving not that you can die from it as people know I don't know I don't know why I'm buying all this stuff one this at the animals don't this low of milligrams I can eat the whole pack not feel anything again they are sativa so hopefully I feel a bit of a buzz they are nano emulsified so they're supposed to hit your bloodstream faster um this isn't sealed pack so these guys are just getting held on the shelves these guys had them for two days now I'm the fifth person to try these apparently so bust the seal I don't know right off the bat they don't it is a smelling raspberry I don't know it's a very very synthetic smelling this one is not coated in sugar it seems like they're the same type of consistency as the grapefruit gummies that I just reviewed again smell I probably get it give it a hundred I'll look at two out of a five they don't smell very good obviously they've been sprayed with something that's what it smells like to me yeah I don't know they're just they just don't smell good I'm gonna bring the clip the camera up so you guys can get some close-ups of what they look like and then we're gonna eat one we're gonna eat all five okay honestly I'm not really looking forward to eating I ate cookies so far I've eaten the grapefruit gummies and they're both lower than my expectations so that's saying quite a bit with these I'm not expecting much I can they're probably gonna taste terrible the consistency I'm probably not gonna like the bus is the main issue that I have with these gummies is they're they're also low THC that for me personally I need something higher these are high enough let's go ahead and try our first raspberry gummy from Aurora drift okay first gummy has the same consistency basically as the grape fruit gummies actually prefer this consist like they're basically the same but these ones are a little bit more gummy than the other ones I like that these ones aren't sugar coated the flavor they're their raspberry gummies like what do you expect I can taste the raspberry can't really taste the oil but again at two milligrams of pop and kill when you expect these were eight dollars by the way my kind of girl mommy it's too bad and they come in packs of five eight bucks ten milligrams for me personally I don't think it's worth it for someone out there who has a low tolerance that may be worth it for them again to me I don't think I'm gonna be buying them to enjoy because again 10 milligrams that isn't gonna do much to me I am buying this out of my own money to do my reviews hopefully you guys like my reviews I'm trying to be as honest as I can I don't know I still get a little bit of flavor after you know a minute or two of not eating them so I don't mind the gummies I would buy them again not for pleasure I would probably buy them with someone else's money or if someone else gave them to me how to eat them again I don't think I would actually buy them again personally not for eight dollars not for ten milligrams I have some BC pinkish and I'm gonna bust into pretty quick here I may do a review for that stuff this is from flower don't know if it will either way I hope you guys enjoyed this video look for my other cannabis to reuse because every animal that comes out and then I'm gonna buy them in regular review them hopefully I guess subscribe like this video I don't know like the content Cheers let me off", "Lx1es3XK7vk": "hey everybody gets me for girly here and we're back for the third day of the 20 days of 4/20 I'll get that right eventually today day number three I told you we're gonna do a trio of edibles so sure enough we're coming at you with some Dixie citrus blast gummies now I've had gummies from this company a couple times before I think the last time I had them they were like the sour ones so maybe more of that little citric acid type of like twang and your your gums you know but these are the citrus ones and they have one or two other flavors but not the sour this time over at relief and Burton but majors relief that is but you know I figured I loved all the citrus strains so I'll probably love this one too and sure enough well I'll give you a little spoiler this isn't my first Bagley's so I do sure love them and the one thing I don't like about all the froley proof packaging is that right there but you know it is what it is don't eat the silica package just you know fYI these come in at I think 20 milligrams for peace it's 200 milligrams per bag and they're pretty tasty tasty now these say it's made with high-quality sativa oil sativa indica distillate is that what we're talking about cuz you know it's hard to really make that claim when you don't have any terpenes left in it but they work and they work really well and I'll be honest I taste pretty darn good too so shout out to Dixie I think that's made by Joyce labs absolute southern here mmm now if you like that lemon the orange kind of that flavor gummies give these a try pretty tasty until next time guys good luck going grow big", "kQC2ShkiMcQ": "hey everybody we have our resident colorado-based subject matter expert on with us today Laney ganja is going to talk to us about some beginner advice for those of you who have never enjoyed a THC infused edible what to do when you're choosing your edible how to take it how long to wait before you feel any effects and what to do if you are experiencing some of those negative effects that THC can sometimes be associated with well first of all edibles are definitely not we're impatient people because that's a mistake that I hear a lot is people are like well I ate this cookie I didn't feel anything so I went back for more that's the number one mistake people make you don't want to do that if you're gonna go the edible route it takes patience your body is literally consuming something and it's breaking it down just like you do food and it's processing through the liver so that is a whole process in itself and not something that isn't like when you're inhaling something so as a beginner just say for instance you went to the dispensary here in Colorado they make a lot of 100 milligram portions of things that are then broken 10 milligram pieces so as a beginner say you picked out your I don't know maybe you picked out the coolest chocolate bar that they had and you open it up as if it was like a Hershey's bar it'll say a hundred milligrams on the package so you know this has ten servings and you will just pick up that one little piece of ten milligram portion and if you're nervous about it go ahead and cut that two milligram portion in half consume that five milligrams assess yourself in about an hour even up to two hours and then decide if you'd like to have your other half or have another piece um you know definitely just be patient with the process and understand that it's going to be much more enjoyable when you approach it that way so well you know if you ever consumed too much of an edible and you're not enjoying yourself you're not having a good time just remember that the negative feelings and bad experience you're having will pass it's not permanent it's all gonna fade with time if you're really not enjoying yourself make sure you're just drinking water make sure you're relaxed make sure you're comfortable watch a funny movie watch music videos scroll on YouTube do all kinds of things go outside and get some fresh air if you need to tears just know that it's all gonna pass with time you're going to be fine and use it as an experience to learn a lesson like oh that's too much for me I should not consume that much and understand how much to take for next time to make it more enjoyable does caffeine help does anything like can you take something else that might help take the edge off so that's where CBD comes into play that's where CBD is like your best friend and such an amazing thing to have on hand because it really counteracts sometimes the negative experiences and feelings that THC might bring bring on so if THC is causing you to feel paranoid or anxious CBD can then balance that out take away some of that anxiety and create a really nice experience so utilizing something like having CBD tincture on hand or CBD capsules like what Daryl has having things like that on hand and those times of need could be very beneficial or better yet if you're somebody that's even to begin with about being anxious and paranoid you should probably take CBD in conjunction with your THC to begin with you should probably just take them at the same time or better yet find an edible that's already been infused equally with both so at the dispensary when you're looking at all the different products you could even ask the budtender you could say hey I'm nervous that I might get a little paranoid I'm new to THC could you point me to some edibles that are already infused with CBD and THC and they'll point you to that direction if the dispensary does not have a plethora of CBD items that's where it's cool that companies like Charlotte's Web and pure hint Botanica 'ls and companies like that that have good quality sources of CBD that you can just buy straight off of online we've talked about how important the sourcing is before but those are really good trusted companies Charlotte's Web Puran botanicals there's several others there's like Haley's hope out there so there's some religious ones that you could just purchase online if your dispensary does not seem to have a lot of good CBD options yeah just throws an extra precaution it definitely does not hurt to make sure that you've already eaten before you take your edibles so it probably wouldn't be the best idea to take your edible on an empty stomach especially if you're brand new to it so just to ensure to have a good time you might as well make sure you have at least a snack before you go into your edible this will give the edible and the THC something to kind of stick to something to help it hit and activate within your stomach and it's just gonna make for a better experience is there is there a possibility that it could upset my stomach kind of like aspirin can upset your upset your stomach I just feel like if somebody is brand new to this and they take it THC edible on an empty stomach that I feel like it could just be a lot for their system to have a brand new to it and especially on an empty stomach I just feel like it's giving you a chance to upset your stomach or just make it less enjoyable so just like as a precaution basically don't forget we don't eat and don't forget to drink water because those things are so very important for a good experience do you have a product or business you want to share we want to know what you have to say leave us a comment on our website at the THC foodie comm or on twitter at safety HC foods [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "4lsLPE2AjDk": "Hi Bold Bakers! Every summer I do a Popsicle video and soon\nafter I get inundated with your gorgeous photos. Today I've got five brand new popsicle flavors\nfor you to get you really excited for summer. So let\u2019s get started. So before we start, the recipes for the popsicles\ncan be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com and, as always, to not miss out on any of my upcoming\nvideos, don't forget to subscribe to my channel. Now, popsicles. They are so fun to make, they're great for\nsummer, and easy. The first popsicle we\u2019re going to make is\nkind of a twist on a childhood classic. It is a strawberry milk popsicle. Into a bowl, add in some milk, cream, sugar,\nand strawberry pur\u00e9e, and then mix all together. So for your strawberry pur\u00e9e, you can use\nfresh or frozen strawberries and just pur\u00e9e them up in a blender until they\u2019re nice\nand smooth. And also, if you want to have no seeds, just\nstrain your pur\u00e9e. So there you, like I said, popsicles are so\nfast to make, this is ready to go into our mold. So here\u2019s the popsicle mold that I use,\nit\u2019s inexpensive, I really, really like them, and there\u2019s a link on my website of\nwhere you can buy these. Also, popsicle sticks, you can find those\non my website too. Okay so now we\u2019re just gonna fill up our\nmolds with our strawberry milk popsicle. So I find it much easier and less messy if\nyou pour your mix into a jug so it\u2019s easy to pour into your molds. Okay, lovely. On with our hat, and in with our sticks. Okay, lovely. Now the great thing about popsicles is they\ndon\u2019t take that long to freeze, roughly 4-6 hours and then they\u2019re ready to be eaten. So here I have some strawberry milk popsicles\nthat I made yesterday, don\u2019t they look absolutely gorgeous? So now, I\u2019m gonna dress up these popsicles\na little bit. I have some melted white chocolate here, and\nI\u2019m just going to dip a corner of my popsicle in there. Gorgeous. Now the cold popsicle will actually set this\nchocolate straight away. And then just something a little bit extra,\nI\u2019m going to add a few little sprinkles on top. Just because \u2018why not?\u2019 So like I said, they set straight away so\nthat means you can eat them straight away. Mmm, oh, yummy! There is something so simple and kind of nostalgic\nabout this flavor. Oh, these are absolutely delicious. Okay, one popsicle done, let\u2019s move on to\nour next flavor. I\u2019m excited about this next one because\nit\u2019s one of my favorite desserts. All the layers, different flavors, in one\nfrozen treat. It is a banana split popsicle. Into a food processor or a blender, add in\nmilk, yogurt, sugar, and fresh banana. Then, pop on your lid and blend all together. So the reason I\u2019m doing this one in a food\nprocessor is because I want the banana to blend up really, really well, but if you don\u2019t\nhave a food processor, just mash up your banana by hand and mix all your ingredients together. Okay, this is looking good. It\u2019s nice and pur\u00e9ed, now here I have a\nfew strawberries that I diced up, because a banana split is not a banana split if it\ndoesn\u2019t have strawberries. So I\u2019m going to add a few of those in and\njust gonna stir them in, so when you\u2019re eating your popsicle you get nice chunks of\nbanana and strawberry. Okay lovely, this is ready to be put into\nthe mold. This is one favorite popsicles because the\nbanana makes it really, really creamy and thick. So delicious. So you\u2019ll see your popsicles make roughly\naround 8-10 popsicles, so you will have loads for your friends and for your family. And then again, on with our hat, and in with\nour sticks. So now we still have more things to add to\nour banana split popsicles, so for right now I\u2019m gonna pop these guys into the freezer. So here I have some banana split popsicles\nthat I made yesterday, don\u2019t they look gorgeous? The thing about it is, they\u2019re not a banana\nsplit popsicle just yet, because here I have some melted chocolate in a glass and what\nI\u2019m going to do is just dip the top of the popsicle into the glass and then dip it into\nsome sprinkles! Make it still to the chocolate. And there you have for yourself a gorgeous\nbanana split popsicle. Okay now this guy is all decorated and ready\nto go, ready to go into my mouth. Mmm, oh yum! The banana is so creamy; I just love it so\nmuch. And the strawberries, mmm, and then chocolate\non the outside. This is a whole big dessert wrapped into one. Mmm, absolutely love it. Okay, so our flavors are just getting bigger\nand bolder, so let\u2019s move on to our next popsicle. So now on Bigger Bolder Baking, we often do\nflavors that I like, so this next flavor is for Kevin, because he works so hard. It is a chocolate and peanut butter popsicle. Into a bowl, add in milk, yogurt, sugar, and\nsmooth peanut butter, and then whisk all the ingredients together. As you can see, this is a really thick popsicle,\nit\u2019s one of the reasons I like it so much. Okay, lovely. This is ready to go into our molds. Now like I said, you can see this is really\nthick, so it might be a little messier than the other ones, but just with a spatula, try\nand push down the popsicle mix into your mold. And get as much in there as you can. And then, because sometimes there can be air\nbubbles, all you want to do is just take your popsicle mold and [tap, tap, tap, tap] tap\nit on your counter and get rid of all those bubbles, so you get a nice, clean popsicle. Okay, great. On with our hat, and in with our sticks. Okay, another popsicle, ready for the freezer. So now we did the peanut butter part of our\npopsicle, now we\u2019re gonna do the chocolate part. So here I have my frozen popsicle, ready to\ngo. And I have my melted chocolate that I dipped\nmy banana split one in earlier, and I'm just gonna go ahead and dunk half my popsicle in\nthere, and then place it on the tray and scatter over a few chopped roasted peanuts. Gorgeous. You get nice texture, different flavors, yummy. So go ahead and keep dipping and dunking your\npopsicles. Mmm, Kevin's gonna love these. I think I hear him coming so I'm gonna eat\nthis real fast. Okay, don't tell him we made them! Let\u2019s move on to our next popsicle flavor. Our next flavor is a classic so we can\u2019t\ndo this video without it. It is a mint chocolate chip popsicle. Into your bowl, add in your milk, yogurt,\nsugar, and mint extract. So now our next ingredient is optional, but\nif you want to put in a little bit of green food coloring, just to turn it that kinda\nminty color, you know the way you see in stores, feel free to do that. And if you don't want to, just leave it out. Now that all our ingredients are in, give\nit a nice whisk up. And then last but not least, add in your chocolate\nchips. Give it a quick stir, oh my gosh, this smells\namazing. I love mint and chocolate. Okay, this guy is ready for our molds. So I have my mix in my jug, and I'm gonna\npour it straight into my molds. So here\u2019s a little tip; I don't know if\nyou know this, but I am a HUGE fan of TJ Maxx, they sell great popsicle molds and really\ncheap so make sure you go in there, check it out and see if you can find something good. I always do. On with our hat, and in with our sticks, and\nthen we\u2019re gonna pop it into the freezer. After just a few hours, this is the gorgeous\npopsicle that you will end up with. It looks and smells delicious. Mmm, yummy. You can\u2019t beat mint and chocolate, it is\nsuch a great combo. Mmm. So this is our second to last popsicle, just\nimagine what our next one is gonna be like. So recently when we made two-ingredient no-machine\nice cream, I made a Neapolitan flavor, and you guys went nuts for it, so I thought, \u2018What\ncould be better than actually making it into a popsicle as well?\u2019 So that's our next flavor. Into our bowl, add in some cream, yogurt,\nsugar, and vanilla extract and whisk all together. So now this is the base flavor so what we\u2019re\ngoing to do is divide this between three bowl, evenly. Add some strawberry pur\u00e9e into one, mix it\nall together, and then add some cocoa powder into another one, and then mix that all together. So now that we have our three flavors for\nour Neapolitan, let\u2019s start to build our popsicle layers. So here I have my strawberry flavor, and I\nhave it in a piping bag, you can also put it in a Ziploc bag and snip off the corner,\nand all I'm going to do is fill up my popsicle mold around a third of the way up with my\nstrawberry. Do this for your whole mold, and this gonna\nbe our first layer. Okay, great. Now that this is done, we\u2019re gonna pop it\ninto the freezer for around two hours and let this layer freezer, and then we\u2019re gonna\ngo again. Now, put on your hat, pop in your sticks,\nand then pop it into the freezer for two hours. When your first strawberry layer is set, go\nin with your next layer, which is your vanilla. Now the reason that I like to use piping bags\nis because it gives you lovely, clean layers. But you can always use a spoon if you don't\nhave them. Okay, great. So now pop it back in the freezer for another\ntwo hours and then we\u2019re gonna top it off with our last layer. And then last but not least, we have our chocolate\nlayer, for the grand finale. Just pipe him all the way to the top. Fantastic. I'm really excited for these because they\nlook so pretty. Now we're gonna pop these guys back into the\nfreezer for maybe another two to three hours and then they're gonna be ready to eat. Now I know that last popsicle flavor might\nhave seemed like a labor of love, but check this out. Look how pretty it is, and you get three flavors\nin one. Oh, my gosh. Oh, this is so yummy! Have a little bit of chocolate, a little bit\nof strawberry. While it\u2019s hot out this summer and you've\ngot some extra time, make sure you try out these recipes. I know you're going to love them.

but you just decided to get a little tipsy evan we know what we're doing just hold the camera okay elena so i i am the director and so okay literally shut up it's about to be really hot [Music] i thought this smells good hi chef are those for us yeah just a little someone i'm working on you guys like nuts right we love nuts wait isn't it supposed to be like a frosting or glaze on them yeah i have some right here well wally are you gonna glaze our bun yeah can you glaze our buns already yeah i'll get on the right place okay wait wait wait wait wait wait okay okay okay i need i need a concentrate i need a concentration concept okay okay wait wait okay okay i need a okay oh my gosh it's okay oh my god i'm so sorry so today we will be making brio cinnamon rolls it will take a few days but the results are worth it first start by infusing your cannabis and butter you can still use the stovetop double boiler method but this time i'll be using a new machine the levo gifted to us by elena koshka i still prefer to decarb the weed at 240 degrees fahrenheit for 35 minutes then infusing at 150 degrees fahrenheit for at least 6 hours the longest step in this recipe is the brioche dough and should be done first first scale out your flour in a mixing bowl and add instant dry yeast with your dough attachment mix for about 15 seconds to disperse the yeast evenly next add salt sugar milk and eggs i prefer to use oat milk but you can use cow milk or any other milk substitute using a stand mixer mix for four to six minutes on low speed until a dough ball is formed after your dough is formed set a timer for 30 minutes in small increments start adding your butter on low speed wait until the butter is fully mixed before adding your next portion after 30 minutes add an additional 10 minutes on low speed to further develop the gluten strains make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl in case any ingredients don't get mixed in properly while you're waiting for the last 10 minutes of mixing grease a bowl with oil or cooking spray plop your dough onto your prepared bowl and let it proof for an hour with the clean towel lightly draped over the top after an hour place your dough on a lightly floured surface and you're going to pat the dough to remove any pockets of air and then fold the dough into itself don't forget to give your dough a nice slap set another timer for one hour and repeat the folding and padding process place seam side down back into your prepared bowl keep your dough in the fridge for at least 8 hours but preferably overnight now we can prepare candied pecans i didn't use an actual recipe but this is a basic way to candy anything first toast your pecans in an oven at 325 degrees fahrenheit for six to nine minutes add brown sugar and spices in a medium sized pot and add a small amount of water and place over heat let your sugar and spices fully melt until it's a liquid and it starts to bubble place all your toasted pecans into your sugar mix and stir to coat each pecan keep on low heat and keep on mixing your sugar will start to crystallize you can now add your infused butter and then continue to mix once everything looks coated place your candied pecans on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake at 325 degrees fahrenheit for 5 to 10 minutes let your candied pecans cool down completely before using or eating you can make your cinnamon roll filling or smear right before you plan on rolling out your dough to make sure it's pliable and easy to work with make sure you're using soft butter for this in a mixing bowl add your infused butter light brown sugar white sugar honey vanilla extract and cinnamon using a paddle attachment mix until fully incorporated and homogeneous now that the dough has been in the fridge overnight i like to work the dough by hand and pre-shape it into a square before i start rolling it out you can roll out your dough into a square or rectangle shape put small dollops of smear all around your dough so it's easier to spread spread your smear evenly all the way to the edges and then top with chopped candied pecans add an additional layer of cinnamon and then you can begin to roll the dough [Music] once rolled cut into eight even portions and place on a baking tray you can use rings or molds to keep around shape but this is optional let your cinnamon rolls proof for one hour then bake at 325 degrees fahrenheit for 30 to 45 minutes remember to check them periodically and don't forget to rotate your tray while they are baking we can make a glazer frosting for this recipe i am using a basic glaze of powdered sugar oat milk melted butter and spices add everything in a bowl and whisk together until smooth but still liquid you may or may not need to add more milk once the cinnamon rolls are golden brown remove from oven and take off all the molds before they begin to stick pour your glaze over your warm rolls and enjoy since you walked in i've been smelling this and um this is a new and improved this is the 2.0 came out of the oven look at that [ __ ] bro come on just hang damn who [Laughter] yeah so you guys already had the old version how was the high i was high [ __ ] [Laughter] point period you went out and man you started killing it all with some music videos yeah i was doing music videos i was touring for like three years it's great um meet and greets pop-up shops [ __ ] bunch of [ __ ] cool [ __ ] yeah man and we would always like to cross paths somewhere yeah each other i'll always be like bro your music videos are dope we were going to work together on a music on something like that and then it ended up being this one of that kind of star that pivot happened from going to music towards more of what you're doing now with gas station l.a so i started working with this company um creative director uh brand ambassador and marketing specialist for them uh started making their [ __ ] go up we [ __ ] started pulling up all these [ __ ] artists now you're telling me you're going pulling up lil wayne yeah chris brown shout out to chris brown shall we trippy reg shout out trippy i was just there last night crazy bro i know blue face yeah came through here right before we did yeah blue pulled up the other day that is wild bro and the the weed or the product that you guys have is just like really top shelf top line that's what's so so good about this company bro is like when you have something that's so [ __ ] good you don't have to try that hard that's what i'm saying about these you got the perfect audience and the perfect branding i mean you're killing it that's where i come in yeah we'll have to throw up your new packaging yeah yeah yeah man these are the new bags that helped design for them and printed them up so it's all about branding every last detail even though i love that come on i love that branding is important this is what most artists will pretty much be getting whenever we pull up on them a full pound aren't there so yeah you actually [Applause] there it is sad is that gas station the edible sent in yet yeah a little bit of relaxing a little bit [Laughter] and now we're actually we're actually trying to work on a collab now right yeah yeah we want to come out with a gas station la like gelato flavor and even maybe a candy bar yeah so 2021 that's coming up 20 21 yes we're gonna have honestly man working together but also just kicking him out like yeah yeah he's gonna catch up with everybody it's always gonna have the homies from like back in the day we got william route in the house that's right well we are in william route's house california i heard you're the cinnabon mastery bro i i wouldn't say the master but like the master eating them i remember the first time i heard about cinnabon it was a bad day i eat like three oh no yeah oh this is trouble good well it's it's really a pleasure to be here man we met was it two over almost two years ago now it feels like it i i feel like it's been two years it's crazy man it feels like yesterday i just feel like yesterday we were out in mount adero manateer got it yeah yeah building houses i mean it's pretty amazing if you guys want to go i'm ready you ready i'm ready to go back man are you guys down i just i'd be down it's time bro to go back help out however i can because i loved not only doing the video and stuff but getting my hands like on the just learning how to build a house yeah you guys just literally just build a house from just scratch scratch background this is a damn house everyone says to me they're like i have no building experience and it was like i kind of look like i would have building experience but when i went down there you had no idea no idea there's some great people who teach on the fly and it's all for a family that's never had that never yeah what was really cool too that i liked is some of these houses have like ocean views and it's like these these family never had like a house and now they have an ocean view house that's pretty incredible yeah so next time we have one you guys are both coming right absolutely how important that space is the space your domain your house your home yes you this is what you do this is what you do for a living route home team home team yeah real estate yeah now when did you start this um i got my license in 2015 while still at usd my first year i i only saw like four houses and only four houses yeah like i guess i have tough standards but i hit 17 my second year oh damn yeah it's a huge leap yeah so that was pretty rad felt pretty good about that and then now we sell over a house a week oh wow which is like pretty insane that we have a team of attention yeah that's a lot of houses so you're selling all the beachfront properties i mean we pretty much sell from from the border up to orange county uh we're dipping into la so yeah which is which is really cool how are you feeling so far by the way yeah i feel good i think i have like the highest tolerance in the world i was a little worried about taking that many milligrams i feel good though i think you know with these edibles too it is a cool experience to be able to fully relax fully indulge yeah fully indulge make it an experience of it so how's it going i don't taste anything i hate weed that's gross i feel like it's like not weedy what's the question again uh we're talking about your non-profit oh yeah yeah all right yeah so we've kicked off so we've done four projects three schools senegal malawi and guatemala and then the first water project was in dominican and then we're supposed to have like three or four more but obviously that's not happening yet but it's gonna be happening you've been everywhere man how did you this guy's there how did you make that happen um i think i i honestly think the simplest formula to have anything is just desire if any of you desire anything enough you'll get it that's i think the only the only way you don't get something is you don't desire enough what's that so i think it's just trying things and getting experiences under your belt and then figuring out what lights you up and then going all in dude you're but you're a stoner so guys here we are with elena koshka oh it's warm on the inside my bro should go though it's [ __ ] bomb how would you say the qualities hi yes that's it guys we got it though all right have a good night we you know we love having guests on the show and we explore we really want to explore every horizon and with you you know your work is for some people still taboo but on this show we want to we want to de-stigmatize everything hashtag destigmatize everything it just gives me the money to do what i want to do and like travel and have make my own schedule so yeah and my whole life has been like sexualized by the opposite gender so i'm like might as well capitalize on it sorry yeah and now i'm like doing like production and like directing on so i kind of went away from yeah yeah you know when you started your own like production yeah koshka productions right yeah that's awesome you are a professional you are a human being tax paying just like everyone else and so friends were watching who came on here and had that sort of taboo we have you here not even as elena koshka but as like christina like our friend christina talking to you even just texting hanging out with you you're just like a regular normal person all porn stars are really just regular people and in their private lives yeah like i don't know i expected to meet you and they'd just be like dildos and like [ __ ] right [ __ ] everywhere which there was but not as well a couple times a couple times there was but humanized what is it what is it that you're up to now like how have you kind of shifted from the industry maybe some of the reasons why you left the industry i enjoyed my experiences just because i was i kept to myself and really going to like drugs or partying and all that stuff but um through making the income that i was making i was able to like dive into all my passions in life which it happens to be like nutrition and ayurvedic so you do not take drugs or any of that there's a reason why your body's telling you hey something's wrong like maybe like you're dehydrated or you need sodium or whatever it is but there's always a reason for it your body just doesn't hurt for no reason you can't just mask it with painkillers and like wonder why your life is [ __ ] you have sorry address the underlying issues right but people don't want to they want the easy way around they always wheezy they want the easy they want the solution nowadays it's like it's like the instant gratification like the easy yeah solutions so you will not take action because it's drugs but you will indulge in some high quality medicals from time to time yes i like that aspect that's from the earth but again like now it's fda regulated they can put whatever pesticides and garbage that they want and then like i'm unaware of that which makes me worried but also like you have one life so like live it up also balance though is the important thing in that moderation but like everything in moderation including moderation is what lee likes to say that's good so we were going into one second scrotum nice yeah scrotum thank you thank you for subscribing wait so you you're telling me that you your family unconditional love they didn't even give you any pushback at first like i disowned myself for my family for like the first three or four months

[Music] i'm like a 10. [Music] i'm a bride", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "cTfwKtN-2is": "[Music] you

hold on hang tight okay yeah it's been like two hours I'm taking a look back what I did ate the Hoboken Caminos after a 'those a look around five after I ate the whole pack I was like I'm gonna smoke a blunt so I rolled a blood this blunt Irie don't get high off the bud it was a 16 no 16 percent THC I'm story short I was like around 5:15 when I ate the gummies I smoked it like around six o'clock and when I smoked it um I got really high off that blunt I also go with but I forgot that I ate the gummies and then like around 7:30 wait right now is yeah like all right like well look bro it was six seven thirty when I took the clock it's a little later now that I'm high as and I feel like it's kind of a little bit it's a fine a little bit I don't know the blunt made the edible more like amplified but I didn't feel this high when I ate the when I ate the the other Caminos pretty hot sorry I didn't feel this high when I eat other Caminos which were the apricot that I brought to get this continue soon I'm sorry that my bun I'm looking here I'm sorry but um yeah I'm I'm really good I feel really high um I don't know if I if I sorry I don't know if it's because I smoked that blonde that made me extra higher or it's the Caminos itself I know I should have smoked that blunt but I figured that my high would have been down by now if it was the the weed like my I would have been I really like dead and gone so I don't think I'm sorry so I don't think that oh sorry someone's come that I know later you did the freaking Sun went down pretty quick so long story short these are a sativa those gummy is the pineapple habanero it's just at Eva it is the head high for sure and I got me pretty high I'm gonna lie I know that Blunt didn't I mean the blunt did it give me high but not this high because the blood high marijuana high went down already I'm sure right now it's about almost eight and I'm still like high not like to the point where like oh my god I'm so high like so stone no this is a cool mellow good little buzz high more than a buzz it's a head high it's at the t-virus one soldier's know that and the flavor is good but it's spicy and I hope this video could

i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good

cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra

that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the

it edible back from vegas and your whole arm and body just feel heavy and when you hearing [ __ ] in your ear don't ever underestimate don't ever ask me edible", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "gYVRXNlg0es": "new regulations for cannabis edibles and topicals come into play today and this morning we're looking at what that means from a medical perspective to do that we're joined by dr. maria campos doctor thank you so much for being here ok so in terms of ingesting the cannabis in in in the form of an edible how is that different from smoking it or vaping it so the main distinction is in the way it is metabolized and it's psychoactive ingredients so we know that when cannabis is smoked or vaporized it is heated it is converted into Delta 9 THC which is the active ingredient that is transferred from the lungs to the bloodstream and into the brain within a matter of 10 minutes the effects will last about two to three hours whereas with edibles the ingested cannabis has to first be digested by our system and then it has to pass by the liver where it is converted into its active metabolite which is completely different it's called alpha hydroxy THC which is an a more potent and longer-lasting active metabolite so even though the entire process takes about one to two hours the effects are more stronger and they can actually last a - even 12 hours okay so those are the psychoactive effects what about the effects on our biology if it's going through a completely different part of our body in a completely different way what are the health effects of that so we know that for smoking for example there's the inhaled carcinogens the irritants and the carbon monoxide that can enter our lungs and lead to serious respiratory health effects or vaporize cannabis we know that there may be a less from less harmful alternative however we don't still understand its full health effects with edibles there's no carcinogenic effect so many consumers may prefer this method of ingesting it however the risk is more related to the overdosing of cannabis so that was one thing that I read a lot about in the Colorado experiment which was everything was seem to be humming along very very well and yet people didn't know how to how to dose themselves properly with the edibles at all so a lot of children were getting into it that's a separate conversation yes and that takes us back to the way it is metabolized which for people who might be first-time you in those couple first hours where they're not having any in effects they may be tempted to ingest more and then that leads to the more serious adverse effects like paranoia hallucinations psychosis that can last for prolonged periods of time lastly what do we need to know what else do we need to know about this new frontier in legal cannabis so one thing is like you said the public health concern that there is with accidental ingestion by children or even by our pets that you know poses a huge health risk to the population but also the fact that we shouldn't be consuming it with alcohol and that we if we have any other health issues that we shouldn't really be consuming cannabis all right well if you don't know now you know dr.

I'm excited to bring you another installment\nof my frozen dessert line up. This week we're making Popsicles and with\nall of the flavors, there will be something for everyone. So let's get started! To freeze my popsicles, I have this lovely\npopsicle tray that I got online and I put a link in the description box below of where\nI bought this but if you don't have one of these do not worry. You can always use a disposable drinking cup\nor you can always use an ice tray which every single house has. The first popsicle flavor we're making are\ntwo of my favorite summer flavors and that is mango and strawberry. Into your food processor, add in your mango\nchunks and then puree until really fine. When picking the fruit for your popsicles\ndo not be afraid to use frozen or fresh because both of them will work really well. Sometimes frozen is actually better because\nit's picked in season and frozen really fast so kept in really good quality. Transfer your lovely mango puree into a bowl\nand then we're going to rinse out the machine and puree our strawberries. As you can see, it just takes a few minutes\nto get this lovely strawberry puree. Nice and fine, this is going to make a great\npopsicle. Now that we have our two purees, the only\ningredients that we need to make our fruit pops. We don't have to add any sugar because there's\nlovely natural sugar already in this fruit. To create a really pretty popsicle, I'm actually\ngoing to put these flavors in in layers. So a little bit of mango. A little bit of strawberry. And then some more mango on top. Once your popsicles are done then on with\nthe lid. And in with your popsicle stick. The great thing about popsicles is that they\nonly take around 4-5 hours to freeze so you'll be eating these little guys in no time. I made these earlier because I really wanted\nto show you what they looked like when they're done. They look beautiful and they taste great,\ntoo. They're a perfect summer treat! The next popsicle we're making is the best\nof both worlds. It's a little bit creamy and a little bit\nsweet and fruity. It is a creamsicle. In a bowl, add in your plain yogurt, cream,\nvanilla extract and some sugar and mix it really well together. So the reason we add sugar to the dairy is\nbecause if it froze on its own it would be like ice crystals so we add the sugar in there\nto help it freeze and make it nice and creamy. However if you don't want to add white sugar,\nyou can always add honey, maple syrup or even a natural sugar. So we have our creamy layer done for our creamsicle\nso the next layer is fresh orange juice. Now you can use store-bought or you can make\nyour own. To assemble this popsicle, we are going to\nfill up the mold halfway with our creamy layer. And then we're going to pour our orange juice\nin on top. When your molds are filled on with your lid\nand in with your stick. Another lovely popsicle flavor ready for the\nfreezer, and as always my recipes can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com. When your creamsicle is done, it should look\nlike this. Ta Da! It looks fantastic. I know it doesn't look like a traditional\ncreamsicle but it sure tastes like one. I'm going to try to get the orange and the\ncream at the same time. Oh that is delicious. If you like these popsicles, I have so many\nmore frozen treats on my channel along with lots of other baking videos so if you haven't\nalready done so, don't forget to subscribe. Our next flavor up is definitely for the Chocolate\nLovers and should evoke all of those lovely food memories of when you were young and that\nis a fudgesicle. In a heavy bottom sauce pan, we're going to\nadd in our cream, milk and cocoa powder. And heat all of these ingredients until they\ncome to a simmer. Now that your cream mix has simmered, we're\ngoing to pour it over our pieces of chocolate. I like to use dark chocolate because it makes\nthe popsicle that bit richer. Now you just want to let this mix sit and\nlet the chocolate melt for around 2-3 minutes and then we can whisk it all together. What I like to add to my fudgesicle is a drop\nof vanilla extract because it really lifts the flavor of it. Our last step before freezing is that I like\nto sieve this mix to get it nice and smooth so when it's frozen you have a beautiful silky\npopsicle. Go ahead and fill your mold all the way to\nthe top. Put on your lid. And in with your popsicle stick. I'm particularly excited for these fudgesicles\nbecause once they're set they taste like frozen mousse on a stick. They are absolutely divine. When your fudgesicle is frozen this is what\nit should look like. Like a real fudgesicle. Look at that, I have to give it a taste. This popsicle is definitely for the chocolate\nlovers and I highly recommend having a little stash of them in your freezer. They're delicious. The next popsicle we're doing requires even\nless work than the other popsicles. Just two ingredients: lemonade and fruit and\nsuch a beautiful result. It is a lemonade popsicle. For the lemonade, I suggest you use fresh\nlemonade. I actually made my own with some simple syrup\nand some lemon juice. And I love a little bit of lime in my lemon\njuice because I think it really gives it a punch so I put a little bit of zest in there. Go ahead and add your fresh fruit to your\nmold. In the summer, I love peaches, strawberry,\nkiwi, raspberry and blueberry. And then just fill up your mold with your\nlemonade all the way to the top. It's that easy to make this beautiful fresh\ndessert. I love this popsicle because it's so easy\nto make. Once your popsicles are done then on with\nthe lid and in with your stick. Now these little guys are ready for the freezer. How pretty is this popsicle and you can see\nall of the fruit inside. Make sure you use really good flavored fruit\nbecause that's what is going to make this so nice. mmm. It is so yummy! Our next Popsicle is definitely a feast for\nthe eyes and for the tastebuds and that is a rainbow popsicle. To create a beautiful all-natural rainbow\npopsicle, we're going to use the same method as we did for the Mango & Strawberry one. We're going to puree all of our lovely bright\nfruit to get all of the different colors and layers. I'm using strawberries for my red layer. Mango for my yellow layer. Kiwi for green. And of course, blueberries for blue. Once you have all of your fruit pureed, we're\ngoing to add thin layers of each color into our popsicle mold. Feel free to use any brightly colored fruit\nyou prefer. Once your molds are filled all the way to\nthe top, we're going on one more time with the lid and in with your popsicle stick. You will be so amazed at how these turn out. All natural rainbow popsicles. No food dye. No dairy. No added sugar. It is the perfect treat for a summer's day. Once it's frozen, this is what it will look\nlike. Look at those gorgeous layers of color and\nflavor that we built. I'm excited to give this one a try. This lovely little popsicle definitely tastes\nas good as it looks. I really hope you get to try it out. If five flavors weren't enough for you, then\nI put a bonus recipe over on my website: BiggerBolderBaking.com where I show you how to make this gorgeous\nBlueberry and Lemon Popsicle.

force and runs her own cannabis edibles company known as Ruby doobie and we've got a lot of Ruby dooby goodies in front of us right now angel thanks for thanks for joining me thank you for inviting me Dave yeah I'm very excited to talk to you because I've wanted to do something a little more in-depth on pot for a long time and and you brought pot cookies brownies let's get into this stuff first okay and then we'll talk about the history at legalization what do we got in front of us these are some of the things that I make sweet dreams brownie it's a dusted with a little bit of sea salt on top it's about 57 milligrams here so 37 milligrams of THC what does that mean so you you ate that how do you feel after well I personally would not eat a whole brownie right I would have half and that's plenty for me but it really depends on your own metabolism and your your how experienced you are and it can differ on depending on the day and on how much you've eaten that day right and doshas dosage guidelines very you know I've seen recommended dosages between 5 and 15 milligrams for people or some who want between 20 and 30 and this is all sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people because for a long time you know I think I said once on the show when I got my weed card I went in there and I said you know they showed me wax they showed me oil they showed me edibles I said well do you have any just weed you know green buds like old fashioned weed and that made me feel like old I got a guy wants a smoked weed but this is sort of the new thing right well you I think not as many people are familiar with edibles but it's been around and it's a great way to make use of the whole plant because really what when you smoke you're smoking the flowers the buds mmm but you still have all of the leaves and the trim and the small buds and all of that has a you know active ingredients in it too and that's primarily what I used to make my goodies and here's a peanut butter brownie ginger cookie the crew is very excited by the way I'm happy ginger cookies credible cookies and chocolate chip cookies and I make cakes and other things too lemon bars yeah so you make all this stuff and this is for people that may want the medicinal benefits this is for people that may want the recreational benefits it doesn't matter to you right like you're selling it then and yeah it's nice of someone alleviates some pain but right well I work with the dispensaries I work with a handful of dispensaries in my area so I am a member that's that's providing edibles for my fellow members sure and you know you can't really you you can't in California you still have to get a doctor's recommendation to even go to those dispensaries right so my sacha hard it's not it isn't right and and it's tough to make the distinction between what's recreative to distinguish between recreational and medicinal because if it's if you're using it to relax at the end of the day and to de-stress hmm that's me that's it isn't it in some ways yeah all right so let's get a little bit into your story and then we'll talk about business and legalization and all that chef so you got into weed basically I think you were smoking it recreationally but the reason you really got into this was because you were having migraines and pretty much the Western medicine that you were trying just wasn't anything right yes but I think there were two forces that kind of both intersected and and drove me into cannabis definitely my migraines I I've had migraines for many many years and about ten years ago they started getting a lot worse and more frequent and I was trying all kinds of different medications I had a steroids injected into my neck to try to get rid of them I had some prescriptions that were so strong that they require that the triplicate prescription you know and nothing helped me I mean lots of times that the drugs would irritate my stomach so much that I would feel worse sometimes they would just knock me out and that's how I was survived my migraines no and cannabis is really what allowed me to to continue living and manage them without having to check out for weeks at a time or days at a time so that definitely treating my migraines was one forest and also a desire to simplify my life you know I am I was working at the XPrize Foundation I was a chief of staff there and you know very rewarding challenging position but I just felt that there was something missing you know I I wasn't spending very much time with my son who was two years old at the time I would have to travel a lot and I just wanted to create a change in my life where where I would not be so dependent on on a check grow growth my own food and cook my own meals and and rather than pay someone to do this and that I wanted to do those things I wanted to be the one with with my family right so that's really interesting so it wasn't just I want to get stoned and have a good time you got into the edible garden thing which it was nice you were growing weed but you were also growing stuff to actually eat and to lead to feed your child we were growing in at one point we were going enough food in our garden that it was too much for us to even eat I mean neighbors would come and we encouraged our neighbors to come and tomatoes artichokes peppers eggplants collard greens charred kale I mean we still have you know lemon trees apple trees nectarines oranges it's a beautiful thing to just go outside and pick your food and you know you don't have to get in your car yeah yes you can't get anything fresher than that yeah it's funny I have I mean I live in LA - and you know I have a little outdoor space with a little garden and even if I'm just plucking tomatoes or something I find that very therapeutic oh it is so just that action of doing of growing something for yourself whether it's marijuana or a tomato or a pepper or something even right there connecting with nature this is all intertwined with ultimately you going into this business I believe so I mean it's wanting to simplify wanting to be more in touch with nature you know it's so easy to get disconnected from food and to know what food looks like when it's actually growing I mean when I when we first planted our garden it was with the help of a nonprofit called la green grounds and we had 50 volunteers come out and help us plant our front yard and our parkways and I was intimidated because I had never tried to grow food before and I didn't know how it all worked and it's I'd never put my hands in the dirt and planted anything and to watch things grow and to be able to feed my family that way and and help you know feed the neighborhood it was an amazing experience and food food is medicine you know cannabis is medicine I mean I really don't see much of a difference right so you see this green thing that grows naturally from the earth like all this other stuff that we eat you see that just sort of as an extension of every other thing but the city wasn't that thrilled right with your your garden so here you are a person that sort of takes life into your own hands on your own property and the city of Los Angeles what did they do well okay going back a little while I what got me inspired to plant the garden as I watched a TED talk by Ron Finley I don't know if you've heard of him the gorillas garden against gangster garden oh okay yeah so um the whole idea of that he presented growing your own food is like printing your own money I mean there were some things that just resonated so deeply with me that immediately after I saw the talk I I got in touch with la green grounds and said I I need to learn how to do this how can I volunteer and it turns out they were actually looking for an LA resident to plant a garden and the timing was perfect so we planted we were selected and that's how we got our garden so yeah the city though didn't want you to do it it's something all right so Ron when he when he did his TED talk he had planted an edible garden a few years before mine and was sighted and went to City Council and made the case that you know it doesn't make sense you should allow people to grow food on their on their parkways and the City Council at that time agreed and said that they would work to change the laws in fast forward two years later I plant you know we plant our garden and I was operating under the assumption that it was all good right the the changes were in the works but a few months after this we were cited I mean a guy came to my house and kind of aggressively said you know all of this has to come out and you have 48 hours to put it all back to the way it was and so this had nothing to do with weed just to me know this is known squash yeah oh yes eggplants oh yeah things like that so that because we had the support of a lot of you know la green grounds and Ron and it was easy to to get attention drawn to the to the issue it had been going on for some time Lopez from the LA Times came out and and wrote an article about our garden and it it helped bring the City Council's attention back to this issue and not long after that they did change the laws so you anyone in LA can can grow fruits and vegetables on their on their Parkway before you had to there was only a short list of approved things you could grow right and if you wanted to deviate from that you had to I think filed a request and I think was like $400 to even ask just to ask to use your own property yeah your own yeah and then you know you might not get the approval yeah so now I think the way the law reads is you can grow whatever you want except for some some fruit trees are not allowed to be on the Parkway but it was it's a huge step right right now as long as you have a medical marijuana license you can also grow eat I'm guessing you can't do that in the front of your house though I don't think it was it would be such a good idea probably not a great idea all right well I don't want to get too into the weeds on that one antenna but I thought it was an interesting way to start because it shows how marijuana and legalization and medicinal uses and all that are so tied into our legal system and then we can get into some of that stuff so alright so you have the migraines you start saying all right I'm going to smoke weed to make myself feel better how long did it take to figure out what worked for you what actually was the right strain and can you talk about strains a little bit well you know I I know with some conditions people look for particular strains you know I think okay so there there yeah let's do let's do one away yeah when you talk about cannabis there there's cannabis indica and sativa right I sit there they look different physically like sativa plants are usually taller and leaner thinner branches and grow better in warmer climates kazar kind of shorter and bushier and hard ear besides that indicas are usually they help to relax you most people will use them at night too as a sleep aid or and sativas generally will give you more energy let you keep more focus so more people will use sativas during the day because you can still function all my comedian friends that get stoned on sativas and write all day yeah exactly right and then within okay so you have strains that are either indica or sativa or they can be a hybrid and then each particular strain has its own profile how much THC is in there how much CBD is in there yeah and so let's unpack that a little bit so THC is the psychoactive are correct and CBD is is it's the medicinal part is there to describe that THC also has medicinal properties but it is the psychoactive a element CBD is is cannabidiol it's another cannabinoid those aren't the only two I mean there there are others and but CBD does seem to have most of the medicinal value I mean it can it can it's been shown to stop some tumor growth it's you know it's great for pain relief its reduces inflammation you know it's I mean I have a friend that takes CBD well for anxiety right and she told me all she does literally is it she's a little dropper in the morning she drops like two drops of every time that's it it doesn't have the diarrhea and vomiting and thoughts of suicide and restless leg syndrome and all the other crazy things that come with all the commercials that you see on TV for all these other antidepressant it's it's there it's so gentle I mean it has so many benefits and has never killed anyone um mentioned that at the top I've never murdered in yeah yet to happen but it's it still boggles my mind that a plant first of all that has so many medicinal properties so and besides medicine I mean what about you know renewable energy and you know paper you know I mean it's it's strong it's a strong fiber I mean replace so many things the fact that we look at it is such an evil thing I don't understand yeah how can I can tell it it truly boggles the mind yes yeah yes all right so we have THC CBD and then you have the indica and sativa and the hybrids of that so for the medicinal stuff let's just do that first people if you didn't want to get stoned but you just wanted medicinal benefits that's where you would use just the CBD is that right um okay CBD yes you you want that but there's been a lot of research research that shows that CBD alone is not as effective as when you mix it with THC meaning that it's the whole plant that you want to treat you with not just taking a one piece of it um I think it it's referred to as the entourage effect because there's so many elements and they all kind of work together so people who are looking for CBD are usually looking for CBD rich strains or in some cases you know like the concentrates and things like that but I think for the most part you'll find that they're more effective when when there is a little THC in there yeah so when you found the right one for you well first up how long did it take for you to find weed that was like oh these migraines are dying you know I didn't even think about weed as a treatment for my migraines because when I get bad migraines I would get very nauseous dizzy a smoking pot was the last thing I thought would help me really but then I I did read that it helps and for me it's it it relaxes me enough that I mean it it helps the nausea and also it helps me control the anxiety that comes along with with the onset of a migraine I don't know if it's like two things attacking you at once if the migraine but then knowing it's coming now you're said oh my gosh about that yes and the need to try to hit both it treats both of those things yeah yeah yeah um all right so then you started doing that it was working when did you say all right I could make a business out of this or I got it I gotta tell people what's going on here well you know a friend of mine was baking and I was fascinated by it and so I would look up recipes and send them to me you should try this you should try that and he's finally he got to the point where he said you know what angel you should try it so I started experimenting and that's how I got introduced to making edibles and then I started trying them because well honestly I tried a few edibles and hated them I mean this is going back to like 2008 or something I mean before they had perfected right the brownies in the cook exactly I mean at that time you'd go to a dispensary and you'd see stuff that was just in like Ziploc bags and you know totally unappetizing to look at and oftentimes didn't taste very good and I mean I found myself in those early days just sort of like you know eating it real quick and just hoping for the best when now it's like literally it's like going into a great Baker oh you can get any anything pizzas sauces so chocolate bars can be any I can think of yeah you", "7OC5rJs9Mbk": "it's time to turn up the fun with real fruit gummies yes real fruit gummies so you may be sitting there saying yourself wait a second Jeff this is walking a candy aisle what are these gummies doing here well I'll tell you my friends these may look like your average snack pack pack of gummies and you might see in your your kids lunch for the fair you know for school but these are these are close enough to candies that I think they they certainly qualify in fact they're made by the subsidiary of dare or the sub brand of dare the Dare candy company in fact in their marketing they're not positioned as as as anything other than candy albeit healthy candy corn unquote as I see on the packaging they are gelatin free they are also not free gluten free and fat free so that's not a bad start but then again they're gummies so they don't necessarily have to have any of that stuff there is a Canadian food company they make I don't know what would what would people know therefore they are sold in the States but I think that probably their most popular products well in Canada are probably Brett and crackers Brett and cat cracker brand which are pretty pretty darn good crackers Viva puffs are like some delicious cookies that they make a kind of a marshmallow cookie with some jam in it coated in chocolate and oh and um bear paws bear paws are like little little cookies in the shape of paw bears or the in shape of paws oftentimes they're dipped in some kind of a frosting or a chocolate and those are sold in packs and those are like 100% crazy popular with kids these days yeah like my kids would love to eat bear paws all the time but we do not send them to just go with them because they're not healthy how ever dared try to make made better you know they try to do do a good job with this these are made with real fruit real fruit juice naturally flavored candies but that's what they are they are candies do not be confused kind of an interesting thing I mean look you can tell the first two ingredients are corn sub syrup and sugar right modified potato starch okay I guess and then there are actual real fruit juices from concentrate blackcurrant pomegranate elderberry and blueberry then from fruit puree pear cranberry marian blackberry in Akai so from those flavours as we know pear is a common flavor to make lots of other base to make lots of other flavors from those flavors we get the actual gummies that we're gonna see in this package cranberry black currant blueberry pomegranate acai and Marion blackberry it's kind of an interesting one I can't remember what a Marion blackberry is like but let's get into this and have a have a look sorry boiled by the packaging if I was a child I'd be ruined alright so this is this is a pretty big package like if you were gonna send this for with your kids for a like on school lunch or something like that's a that's a lot of that's a lot of gummies to me it seems like a lot I don't know okay wow so nice design work on them they've got some carnuba wax in them as expected to kind of keep their keep their have to keep their shape you know interesting interesting interesting so what do I got here I don't know if I have everything do i hmm I got a lot of these guys that's for sure a lot of these ones a couple of these well I think I might have everything where are there one two three four five six different flavors and I've got one two three four five six yeah I guess I have them all but I certainly have mostly pomegranate and then I've got two of the cranberries I have six pomegranate you know sometimes these companies when they're making these kind of gummies especially because these are all each individual different flavors it it cost slightly more to produce certain flavors or certain so they only you know or so they do a lot of it or maybe they just have this kind of patterning more often I imagine that's just sort of a plate that you can sort of you know slot into to define what kind of berry come what kind of shape comes out anyway let's get into this this does not look like a pomegranate but that's okay so this is the kind of gummy you chomp and you do chews through it not as quickly as you would with like the the 3ds say but it's got a little more bounce to the gumminess than that but not a lot I mean it's a little more than actually no it's a little more bouncy than say a swedish fish about barely that flavor was really good that did not taste like pomegranate to me but how often doing pomegranate I guess maybe I'm really not that familiar with that flavor which ones that I I really don't know what that flavor tastes like sorry guys I'm not great at all these fruit flavors when do I eat fruit I'm too busy eating candy let's try the cranberry I got to say cranberry that looks like a peach to me right or you know I don't know something in the peach family a nectarine maybe hmm cranberries do not have that line on them right what's weird why would you design it to look like that good again I'm not totally I'm not identifying this okay actually I am it's got hints of cranberry I don't immediately identify though that though as a cranberry flavor um that's kind of weird that these aren't like jump at you kind of flavors I mean they're they're pretty good they do taste real that's kind of one of a really nice thing about this they absolutely taste like legit on the level like real fruit it does like that's actually not a bad name for these um and the gumminess I like it's not it's not a gummy bear level of Bounce which is for my money too much but still something about these I don't know again it's got like an edge to it like uh Nina's these flavor choices they've all got this like tartness to them don't they that was blueberry yeah I only has hints of the flavor like it's like almost like an aftertaste of that blueberry flavor it's very weird cuz I know it's made with real fruit I get that this 420 here's our family-owned business blah blah blah okay whatever family-owned Canadian business Kitchener Ontario um I gotta say it reminds me of like okay don't take this in the in a weird way but like it reminds me of like like a little like alcoholic sort of flavor you know like it's like an alcoholic like how food flavored with alcohol and he doesn't matter what food it is well always have that slight kind of alcohol taste to it all of these flavors have like that slight like a slight sour alcohol flavor to them it's not actually alcohol it's not entirely like that but that's what it makes me think of that's what it reminds me of that's not to say it's bad like I said it feels very um on the level but not what I was expecting real fruit dummies come in different flavors skews this is their course cue they come in sour as they come in you know mix berry and a bunch of other it's sort of different there's some discs or different consistencies as well to the gumminess but this is certainly the the base level one and I get why people would like it but it's not something that I actually think that kids would necessarily like and to be fair while you might see this sold in that kids gummy section of your supermarket most of the marketing on this is actually directed at adults like on their website the the the marketing copy to go along with this real fruit gummies is like I want to see your favorite band tonight I want to take real fruit gummies and make it the funnest night ever best show of your life something like that which is a little strange because you would think that they would have this that this would be a kids thing but these flavors as well are not really kid oriented flavors like no kids asking for KY berries or Mary and blackberries right I don't know any who would even cranberries are a little out of the realm of you know standard for for kids most of the time so for what these are though they're pretty good I just don't think that it's entirely for me I think that's maybe what it comes down to I think some people really will like this but I I think I'll take a pass on these moving forward I'm glad I had them and very interesting like not at all what I was expecting but these are popular you know in Canada these are very like a pretty well-known brand the real fruit brand so people certainly are buying them anyway you guys who have tried it I'd love to hear what you think in the comments below walking to candy aisle is gonna rate these a three out of five um I think they're doing what they set out to accomplish it's just not exactly what I want out of my gummy maybe that's all maybe that's really
