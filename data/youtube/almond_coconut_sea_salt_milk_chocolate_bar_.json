{"M0MLXz8GqQE": "today heaven an hour if you trying some achok or chocolates these are all covered almonds I have just milk chocolate covered almonds milk chocolate covered sea salt caramel almonds and have the dark chocolate covered coconut almonds these were 39.82 always their sale which is good so we're gonna try just the regular milk chocolate covered almonds it says seven pieces 30 grams is 160 calories and these are made for ollie so they look like chocolate cover all those let's oh that's a good picture or not but just good thick coating on top oh if you hear that tank the weight a big drink we're just getting a drink and he's right behind us in this room mixed I'm sorry and that will probably annoy some people like I can't help it oh then it takes it very good it reminds me of the Hershey's a Hershey bar that has almonds but I like this chocolate a lot more done yeah group it kind of reminds me if you've ever had a world's finest chocolate bar which I absolutely love I don't know if we've ever reviewed those tube or not I should look that up because we haven't we should they're excellent to candy bars and that type of around there one of those motel rooms oh it's the Owens had just a little bit of funk bones but beyond that it's good these are all the same amount of calories seven pieces and her 60 calories so no metric in our chocolate or sea salt caramel which is what they these are they're all 160 calories so since these have sea salt caramel under the almond and milk chocolate it is a lot it's bigger Hustler's there tom I love the texture the thickness the the milk chocolate and the caramel I think it's absolutely delicious good sometimes I think we know is a camel because many drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks I love the texture of things ah rhythm and you thought that no I didn't either no I think it's sea salt at all don't want to see what it look like so again there's no yeah you do have a layer of caramel surrounding the almond and then you get the milk chocolate on top I really like that hmm me they're different from the first one it's um I wouldn't say it's any better than the first but it's just a different flavor than the first one it's really good quality I love the quality of it this is a dark chocolate covered coconut almonds and honestly and this is the one out of these that got my attention because Kevin I hope I like coconut but Kevin really loves coconut so I thought these sounded interesting yeah coconut mm-hmm oh it's strong mm-hmm don't like a coffee why I think it's chocolate I'm wondering if you don't think that because that yeah I'm sure that's what is that I think it's the chocolate giving that little bitterness to it uh-huh makes it seem not coffee almost the coconuts good though yeah it's got a good layer coconut yeah I'll show you at the M I'm hoping that flight suit yeah mm-hmm but it's like not only hip like a coconut it's like almost like they've used a coconut oil as well because it's so strong it's very strong coconut and yes and I don't like coconut you would love these yes I mean where you would bother you it did not matter that they put dark chocolate at all because the Covenant is so very very strong yeah then it overrides the dark chocolate that's dad daughter I'm gonna go good together anyway so thank you that go very well together but I do think that if you're at all worried about the dark chocolate being bitter you don't need to worry about it in things because that covered it is out there I get a little bitterness from like I said it kind of reminded me a coffee a little bit so I got a little bitterness to it but it wasn't bad like Gus yeah it was good so then you for all of the things and you know we have $4 development in with a bomb all mostly play by the Cold War the caramel mm-hmm needed more salt I think I would God just on regular milk chocolate yeah they needed something else I like the caramel I mean I like them all I'm doing that but yeah if I only had four dollars I think I would just assume have just the chocolate covered because I do think it's a very I think the the chocolate is good quality chocolate the almond came through I just I really like that overall the best yes but they're all good don't go wrong video yeah so if you see these at Aldi and you wonder are those worth it or are they just okay they're worth it they're very very good I can understand why they're four dollars because nuts in general are very defensive so I will have a picture for you with n and thanks for watching [Music]", "YY-vZpWC1sI": "[Music] hi i'm abby welcome to my new york city kitchen where today we're making toasted coconut chocolate bark ah delicious i'm so excited for this so today we're gonna do toasted coconut so the first thing that's gonna happen is i've got some unsweetened coconut flakes here i'm just gonna kind of put them over in a skillet and let them toast up nicely while we move on to our chocolate so you can use i am prep you know i have a preference for dark chocolate so like 70 percent you can also use white chocolate you can also use milk chocolate whatever you enjoy i have a bunch of chocolate chips here i find that in some cases it is easier for them to melt consistently you can also get bars of chocolate that you like and we can break them up and you can melt that easy peasy so i'm going to melt this in the microwave i'm going to put it in for one minute and then i'm going to stir it and then i'll keep putting it in at intervals and will stir it periodically until it melts you can also make a double boiler on your stove to do that you would take a pot with some water and you put the bowl on top of it and then you just mix it you're essentially steaming it so that it melts that way but i like the microwave so we're gonna do that okay so it was in the microwave for about a minute and then two more intervals of 15 seconds it's nice and smooth i'm just giving it a few turns here i'm going to put a pinch of salt we're going to mix that in and then i'm going to put in about half of our coconut and we're going to mix this all together it looks beautiful i have a baking sheet that i've lined with wax paper you can also line it with parchment paper or with a foil i'm going to put everything on here we want to get all of that chocolatey goodness out of the bowl and onto our sheet now i'm just going to kind of hold one end of the wax paper and start to spread this out it's really a free form of chocolate you want to make it thin enough that when it's done cooling you can break it into bits and different size pieces but you don't want to make it so thin that there's not much chocolate left then the next part is we're going to sprinkle the rest of this coconut on top and then i'm going to sprinkle some more salt on there you can use a thicker flaky salt like a maldon or a fancy salt if you will or you can just use your regular kosher salt so now i have this beautiful chocolate i'm going to stick it in the fridge for about an hour and let it firm up and then we will grab it and okay so we've had this in the fridge for about an hour it looks beautiful so all we want to do now is we break it up into pieces this is also a really nice gift for someone so for birthdays or around the holidays you can make different kinds of bark and put them in gift boxes and then you have homemade gifts for your family and your friends and it didn't take very long to do it all super super easy once again i'm abby thanks for watching my new york city kitchen this is my toasted coconut chocolate bark thanks for watching and we'll see you next time [Music] bye", "Bf1dZhgu5ug": "[Music] you [Music] hi I'm Gail and welcome back to Gail's low-carb recipe ideas today we're gonna make a great recipe it's a little treat for all of us and it's a low carb almond coconut chocolate peanut butter whites they are delicious they're easy to make and I think you're really gonna enjoy we're gonna get started and I'll show you how to make it so here I've got my baking sheet my cookie sheet and I have my silicone mat you can use parchment paper if you'd like you don't even have to use a mat for this because what I'm doing is some of the seeds I'm gonna put in the oven I want to toast them up just a little bit to bring out some of the flavor so the first thing I'm gonna add to our dish or our baking tray is slivers of almonds and that's 1/2 a cup which is about 55 grams and then I'm gonna have sunflower seeds 1/4 of a cup and that's about 30 grams so I'm just going to kind of mix I'm not making a great big batch of this I'm gonna do a small amount because I don't need a lot in the house and you might just want a small batch to give it a try to see if you really like it now I have pumpkin seeds and I love these these ones are salted and they're a quarter of a cup of pumpkin seeds and they're about 30 grams as well so I'm just going to spread them up a lot of the pumpkin seeds I bought my Costco actually and that's the the brand that I had bought and then the other ones I buy at the bulk line or in a grocery store and they're in bulk that's the sunflower seeds and we're also going to be putting in coconut flakes I call them coconut smiles I'm gonna put them in in a few minutes I just want these ones here to to roast up a little bit first so I'm gonna put him in the oven of 350 and it's gonna be like 5 to 6 minutes I just want them to I have to be careful though because I don't to go brown I don't want to burn them so while they're baking in the oven I'm going to just take a small bowl that is microwavable and I'm going to melt a few things together so the first thing we're going to put in is one tablespoon of cocoa butter which is about 14 grams now cocoa butter comes in chunks like this smells like chocolate smells delicious here's my package that I use okay so we're gonna put that in the dish then we're going to add in a tablespoon of coconut oil and we want not sweeten we want just regular coconut oil so I've got I can grab onto the bowl properly there we go and that's one tablespoon 14 grams now the next we're going to put in is peanut butter now the peanut butter I love I absolutely love this peanut butter I get it at Walmart this is the brand here and if you read on the back it does say it has one sugar in it but it must be the natural because I haven't added any in but it's two carbs one fiber for per tablespoon and it says here that it's organic roasted peanuts sea salt and that's it that's the only thing that's in here and it's delicious I have no issues eating that by itself compared to others you still have to UM put stir to get the oils all mixed but it's still definitely worth it one sloppy here my goodness I'm gonna have to lick my fingers and I apologize I think I said one tablespoon but it's two tablespoons just in case I don't want to have an error here so now that I've got this in the bowl I'm gonna put it in the microwave and I'm gonna melt everything that took about a minute and half and you still see a little wee bit of the butter the cocoa butter but it'll melt just keep stirring it till it's melted okay the next thing we're going to add in is a pinch of salt and when I say a pinch of salt that's about an 1/8 of a teaspoon and we're gonna add in a little bit of sweetener so I've got 2 tablespoons powdered erythritol so we're gonna stir that in okay now we're gonna add in some chocolate syrup now I'm putting in 30 grams which is about 3 tablespoons and the chocolate syrup I have here is Walden Farms so we're going to add in 3 tablespoons of chocolate nice it it's so good it's just so good so we'll mix that up I have half a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there now I have one egg i whisked it beat it up a little bit my ingredient should have cold right down so it shouldn't be a shot pointed in with the chocolate okay now we just have to wait until we have our seeds all ready to go so I've just removed the seeds out of the oven and I'm going to they're starting to get a little brown just a little bit and I'm just gonna set them aside and then I've got a cup and a half coconuts well some are quite large but you can break them up any time now I'm just gonna spread them out and I'm gonna put them back in the oven for probably about three minutes maybe a little bit longer I'll take a look and we'll decide what we're gonna do so I'm just gonna put them back in and they move me ready to put everything together I've let my seeds cooled down so I'm just gonna pick it up off of the tray and dump them into a bowl you can see where the coconut smiles have browned up a little bit we didn't want to burn them we just wanted to give that little extra okay now we're going to add in our chocolate mixture with the egg and we're gonna mix it up really really well and I've got a little pan here miniature it's like a muffin dish it's quite tiny I'll show you here and what I did was I've sprayed it with avocado oil and I got this nice little sprayer you pump it like this and it shows you and here how much you have for your oil and it's awesome it's really nice so I use that quite often okay we're gonna spoon out our seeds I'm gonna make too much of a mess I don't why just one like a white sighs I don't want anything you can if you had a granola bar or a chocolate bars silicon mat our tray whatever you want to call it that would be nice to have as well but I don't and I'm not gonna go buy one so I'm just gonna play around here and try and get them filled and I'll be right back with you so I got them all to fit in I'm just kind of pressing them down we're gonna put them in the oven at 350 and it's probably gonna be around 10 minutes maybe a little bit more but I just want them to bake up I have egg in here so we need to put it in the oven all right we're all set it just took him out of the oven that was 10 minutes now see if I can it's still hot I'm gonna get a hold of it somehow and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take my little knife here and I'm just gonna work around them while they're still warm because I want to make sure I can get them out all in one so you can see that it looks pretty good that way but I just want to be sure before I let them all settle so we're just going to go around each one and then once they've cooled down I'm gonna put them in the fridge now what I did was I sprinkled a little bit of salt on each one just before I eat them which gave it that little extra it's nice with the peanut butter and the chocolate so you should give that a try it's just holding it up here you can smell the peanut butter and the chocolate mixture quite nice and they they were so easy to get out of the pan maybe they just popped right out quite nice no it is two point three net carbs from one of these and 138 calories but I think it's worth it and it'll just take that edge off of that sweetness you're looking for mm-hmm nice flavor very good and they're chewy when you're biting into all of these different seeds and nuts you're getting a fill so one probably wouldn't really do the trip for you next flavor

really wanted you to hear that crunch these are so crunchy when my husband asked me to make some chocolate-covered almonds for him he said please would you make them crunchy and I said yes because I knew just what to do the reason these are crunchy it's because I'm not just taking raw almonds and dipping them in chocolate I'm taking soaked almonds I soak and then dehydrate the almonds to return them to a crunchy err state and the soaking makes the nuts more nutritious and digestible so no more tummy aches from nuts soaking almonds is super easy to do and I have a free video for you just come on by TRADD cooks cool calm / soaked almonds and sign up for my free video series and one of the five free videos shows you how to soak your own almonds to make them more nutritious and digestible I'll see you there", "uJolp6scU-A": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some quest snack bars I have the chocolate mixed mixed nuts now this is a sea salt caramel on and the peanut butter our peanut chocolate crunch nut peanut butter peanut peanut chocolate crunch these were $7.99 a box at Target but you get five bars in each box the quest f bar is a sweet and savory treble sub snack made with real almonds peanuts and fruit simply delicious they were $7.99 for five this has they all have the same calories they're all 210 calories per bar and I don't know if they all the same yes they all do they all have the same amount of protein 10 grams of protein 1 gram of sugar and 5 grams of net carbs no added sugar it says quest nutrition is on a mission to make the foods you crave work for you and not against you so their packaging looks like a timer that's exactly what I'm saying that they they really make those look like a connoisseurs if you sit there I mean if you sold us sitting there in a box you would glance at that and say oh there's my condo what's that coming yeah yes yeah so this is the chocolate mixed nuts and it has almonds peanuts pistachio sea salt they use a stevia sweetener if you're like you want half of that or if you want No I love goodbye mm-hmm Oh Jim I think this is the best thing question tonight mm-hmm that's really a bowl of the nuts my kids got a good crunch of the almonds mm-hmm these these are I mean we never tried the other two yeah I'm upset calmly but going bye-bye these are gonna be very very successful it's funny the picture looks nothing like the actual wall I think the actual war has more chocolate than bar actually looks better you know the bar has more chocolate coating on it um her go that is delicious I know that you can buy these in singles so - they're selling singles because that way you could primary Volvox right but now I was at Target and I saw them and I wanted to go in and get them target is not the best place to buy eggs if you want to leave singles there they usually sell all their customers in boxes that yeah in bulk other places to get on singles Kroger's really good about having singles but I don't know if they have things have it loves to stop plink what is that Jesus the GNC places like that yeah the Vitamin Shoppe that's not good but if you would have seen these in singles at your stores let us know this is the sea salt caramel on hmm the full mm-hmm the caramel is very sweet now just that one little bite is a mouthful mm-hmm yeah you take small Exodus and just ruling yes enjoyable that would last a long time you know we're counting on that chew it quickly dumb so that you don't have to wait I love the flavor of that caramel the caramel really stands out it's very very sweet and it doesn't have that burnt corn flavor it's just us just a sweet caramel I put all those they have packed it for it would it truly these are gonna be competition for convoys that's exactly they will be calorie the price is about the same in the convoy you're all spins and I think $1 expensive for ya but you are getting tons of whatever nuts they use and I did bomb at Target they may be big anymore specific target you may be able to go in cheaper but I do think these these are completely different from anything from quests that that we've ever had most of their bars are how would you even describe those bars the kind of the quest bars they're like a chewy this nugget we've tried those requests we tried there and do the tortilla chips which I liked we tried those who support the potato chip solution all we did not like to touch ups we tried some cookies and also some pizzas this is the peanut peanut chocolate crunch no one's good it's not my favorite because it's just all one cop flavor mm-hmm when you're eating it it's just thick you're eating peanut butter almost mm-hmm it has a mouthful peanut butter it does it is all peanut it's good I do like it but there's the tropical reason is a little bitter so there's a little bit of bitterness there tip from the chocolate my hope when I buy boxes like this when I'm spending $80 a box that's $24 right here mm-hmm my hope is that when we review it that I'm gonna like it I want to like it because I want to be able to keep it and eat it and not you have to give them away because if I don't like that I'm gonna give them away how will keep all of these I will keep all of them and eat them and enjoy them yeah but work the colors into your diet you do yeah there are a little bit more calories than a traditional why nature Valluvar well to be fair the nature belly burst that I eat are 200 calories oh I see the ones I had 160 so they used to be labeled 190 and then they came out with new packaging and now all of a sudden they're like look 200 so for me going from 200 calories to 210 that's not that big deal yeah yeah if it will work in carving the peanut I really like the peanut I know it wasn't if it didn't have that bitter chocolate I would've liked it if they use the regular milk chocolate or some other kind of chocolate I would have loved it I love the the peanut flavor I like all three I like all of my favorites the sea salt caramel almonds up and my favorite is private first the person was very very good that would be a very close second I wouldn't get that just because of the bitterness I'm more sensitive to bitter though than so that bitterness really I mean I still got that bitter flavor so the bitterness for me is just just overwhelming I have to say though if you like on bars you need to try that yeah McKenna especially these first two these are nothing like the other quest bars if you've tried quest and you don't like the other ones then this is just not even comparison to those these are more comparing to kana bar so it would be interesting to me if you all know right offhand if you can get these in singles how does the head of the prices compare you know are these cheaper or are they about the same price because if you haven't tried this you should tell something unkind bars are not much less than that and you only get like four in the box I see I don't I don't think it's uh I think for all the only good for in a box right so getting five in a box is really good yeah I like that about it too and you're probably right you probably do almost awesome um video totally work Tron if you have had any of these let us know which one and everyone else know which one was your favorite and thanks for watching [Music]", "9PSie88eFdE": "today Kevin and I are maybe trying some kind of bark all three of these are in dark chocolate but mine has roasted peanut and I have almond and sea salt and almond and salted call these were 350 a bike at Meijer it says do the kind thing welcome to the kind community here at kind we think a little differently instead of or we say and we choose healthy and tasty convenient and wholesome economically sustainable and socially impactful this commitments you excellent shine sue and everything we do and how we do it so ingredients you can see them pronounce the number one ingredient is peanuts and then there is creamy roasted peanuts swirl and then 55 percent cacao dark chocolate three servings are in the container one third of the pack or 34 grams 280 calories dr. Olsen yes so we're gonna show you one of them because they're all the same exactly 34 grams had already calories they're not big package and then you'll know no it's no three things need three so but so once we show you won't you'll say the fragrance is the blue arrow Park that's pretty that's 33 previous note 34 a change to 34 so that's exactly where you're going you know so this this is 180 calories those three pieces take your time [Applause] that's very no I start talking mm-hmm it's not very super I mean it's bitter but it's not super bitter a little salt in there I was gonna say I get it's not just from I mean it's in the air since all dinner mixed in yes which makes me excited for the sea salt because they could have said something about sea salt in this one - no businessman salt it has salt the chocolate does tend to take over the peanuts a little bit yes but it's so good yeah you you mainly get you get the peanut flavor but you're mainly getting dark chocolate flavor that saltiness is terrific it's a good little chocolate it does but it's in my teeth and I keep I know that sounds gross but I mean if you eat it you all experience the same thing um you keep tasting that salt and it's delicious so this is the almond and it does look different because it's almonds let me see if I have a little smaller uh-huh yeah looks like almond flakes like this slice those differ BtoB soon  you mmm you once again same time thought oh it's dark chocolate and salt the almonds give it some texture I don't really taste the almonds like a taste of the peanuts right I don't want to taste the phony the almonds they had a texture just the crunch it's chocolate assault boys mostly oh yes they could have left the almonds out I think completely and just done dark chocolate and but I know that's kind that you know they everything they do they're very nutty bars there if you've never had a convo which we reviewed a ton on this channel but if you've never had one they're well worth the money because they are full of that saya and their fruit and yeah they have all kinds of bars they're excellent this you could smell the caramel that it's a strong caramel smell this is the almond and salted caramel and when I climb at the first all-in-one was the chocolate so strong really could taste the elements [Applause] definitely a formal mm-hmm this one is different from the other term but now you don't get much in there no I honestly think the last two were bigger you think these are there's math there 34 grams no I guess you studied about three pieces of them yeah so you're probably gonna forget about nine pieces well they're some of them were broken but no you have to measure you just have to weigh them I like the Khan I like the caramel - I think it's different from the other two because you can taste the caramel over the dark chocolate yeah really you almost takes more almost working you really good but it's not my favorite the first one with peanut butter I think if I had to choose I'd choose depending on it you know I like the second one as well but I really like that peanut and there was it seemed honestly like there was more salt in the pain at one then than in the sea salt vagary um I really did I just thought it was delicious and I do like it that you can taste the peanut a little bit with the almond I really couldn't taste the almond but now in this one with the almond you taste caramel I still enjoy Stallman but I taste normal but for me 350 in you know that's kind of pricey so I would choose the peanut one of them um I really like the common but you don't you lose out on the dark charcoal employer you do you really you do not taste dark chocolate in this one and I like to taste that dark chocolate I probably the peanut they'd be one of the two the peanut of the salty or the calm okay no no I don't know which one yeah I want to taste that dark chocolate because it was a good or talking yeah and when the peanuts are all gone you just you have that salt and dark chocolate flavor and it's just it very very good it's not it's not so dark that it dries your mouth or that it leaves a bitter flavor in your mouth at all very nice the aftertaste of the Carlos is dark chocolate it's not caramel it's kind of dope but I still have Coral I'm still a girl yeah I think our most pretty strong if you don't really like dark chocolate necessarily try to do the call because it's not a strong right so I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end and thanks watching [Music]", "rukd-Zsv5cw": "hi this is Diana with real healthy recipes calm and welcome to the rhr kitchen today I'm really excited to share with you my newest chocolate obsession it's called glazed almond bark what makes this almond bark so amazing is that we're using marcona almonds as opposed to regular almonds which give it a more buttery flavor we're then going to glaze the almonds with a coconut sugar glaze and then we're going to incorporate dark chocolate and then coarse sea salt the combination of the sweet and the salty is amazing let's get started on making recipe in a small skillet combine the coconut palm sugar and water place over low heat and bring to a boil stirring often for about five minutes remove from the heat and mix with coconut oil place the almonds in a large bowl pour the sugar mixture over the almonds and mix well until coated spread the almonds over a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper in a double boiler melt the chocolate over low heat mixing until very smooth remove a quarter of the almonds from the baking sheet and set aside then mix the remaining almonds and the melted chocolate in a large bowl spread the chocolate on the mixture evenly over the parchment paper lined baking sheet sprinkle with the reserved almonds along with some coarse sea salt place the tray in the freezer for 20 minutes before breaking into pieces and survey you", "sXqRt4yR_Tw": "today kevin and i have three new kind bars to try for you uh these are uh two of them are milk chocolate ones dark chocolate so we have a milk chocolate almond a milk chocolate peanut butter and i have an extra dark chocolate nuts and sea salt the uh the two milk chocolate ones were both bought at target they were 7.29 for six bars kevin's dark chocolate or extra dirt extra dark chocolate were 7.99 at meijer so meyer was actually more expensive than target so people have been telling us for years though that they think meyer is very expensive so you know that's but the thing about it is is when you're when you're doing food reviews when you have a youtube channel uh and you're looking for food a lot of times my own has stuff that nobody else has that's probably you get it so yeah and when we went to target target only had the milk chocolate target didn't have the extra dark so i'm gonna hand this to you it looks like your typical kind bar packaging okay it says there are six grams of sugar six grams of protein gluten free the number one ingredient is almonds so welcome to the kind community here at kind we think a little differently instead of ore we say and we choose healthy and tasty convenient and wholesome economically sustainable and socially impactful from the snacks and foods we make to the way we work live and give back our goal is to make kind not just a brand but also a state of mind and community to make the world a little kinder kindly yours daniel lebetsky he is the kind founder one bar 40 grams is 180 calories and these are all uh well this these are different calories so [Applause] it has a texture almost like a caramelly texture i don't got flavor though it's some aqua chocolate the almonds have a good flavor to it it's got a good texture those are good the first ingredient is almonds but the second ingredient is peanuts yeah and you really taste the peanuts you do taste almost more peanuts at all yes because the peanuts are almost stronger than the almonds but i tell you what impresses me always about kind bars is they they're um chock full nuts they really are they they they cost a little bit more but it's because you're buying real quality ingredients and not a bunch of little fillers that they that other companies like to add just to to make them are these these are actually full of nuts um this is very good it's good yeah it's nice you can mainly almond and peanuts what you're tasting and it's the milk chocolate's like it's there it's not strong you could get a little bit of the flavor the um i like the texture though because it's get the crunchiness of the nuts but then it has a um like a sticky softness from but that is something to mention that kind bars aren't intended for everyone's teeth so some are hard some of them are harder some of them are chewier some of them will get stuck in your teeth so we always try to tell you that though so that you'll know um so this the first one it started out really really chewy once you got it in your mouth though it was fine and it did not stick in your teeth so this is the peanut butter and it is this is the highest calorie one here it's 200 calories and it's peanut butter according to her now it's a little tougher to break it it's good it's more um it's more peanutty than peanut butter to me because it's missing some of the salt the sweetness but um it also could use a little salty in this too but that's just me um because i like a peanuts or salty that one surprises me because it is 20 additional calories and it does taste like peanut and not peanut butter it um exactly what kevin said it does not have the sweetness and i'm sure if you looked at the stats and i'll put them at the end of the video i'm sure it's full of sugar but you don't taste it you taste peanut um and it is hard so like i had to turn it sideways in my mouth just to just break it off yeah you can't just get it with your front teeth and and bite into it like a chewy bar it's not like that at all no it doesn't break it off not bite through further i feel like the flares are okay they're just i wish there was a little sweetness and salt um because they're so hard i will probably give those away though because i know you won't need them um but um even though he likes them even though we both like them it is too hard for me and by the time i would be finished with those my my mouth would be hurting yeah so i would not i wouldn't get those for that reason not that they taste bad so these are extra extra dark chocolate nuts and sea salt so we want to taste the sea salt uh five grams of sugar six grams of protein gluten free um they're all gluten free uh it says uh the number one ingredient in this one is almonds so almonds and peanuts just like in that first one except this is an extra dark chocolate so the first one very dark was milk chocolate and it was 180 calories this is also 180 calories so it doesn't matter whether you choose the milk chocolate or the extra dark it still is going to be 180 calories there's a big difference in fiber oh yeah the chocolate's much much darker mm-hmm well like the salt coming through i should have quite a bit of salt wow it's like a lot of things that are typical with sea salt like that that you get it at the end yeah just kind of keeps rolling around but the first one the milk chocolate almond you could taste the almond you could taste the peanut this one you only taste sea salt and dark chocolate that's all you take it's a it's a strong dark it completely covers up um and i don't mind the dark chocolate it's dark but i don't it's even so dark that it it has that drying effect in your mouth but it's so dark that it covers up the delicious which i love the delicious flavor of the peanuts and the almonds completely covers it up so um for that reason i would not buy these again either but if you really like a dark chocolate oh yes absolutely then you still get the texture and stuff of the almonds you do just know that you're not going to get the flavor the flavor is gone uh of those uh almonds and it's for me that's one of the things you're paying more for is you know the flavor of those so my favorite of the three is the milk chocolate on them oh yours too yeah the the peanut butter like i said i i like the flavor of it even though it wasn't sweet even though it was just peanut it had a good flavor but it's so incredibly hard i'm telling you um and i don't have problems with my teeth either it's just um it's a hard bar i just don't know that it would be good for your teeth that may be the batch that that's in if you buy a box it might be perfectly fine right i don't know so yeah yeah so you if you've had those um i know several of you have sent me pictures of these if you've tried them yet let me know if yours were that hard as well so i will have a picture of these for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] foreign", "BcBOKPhfSpE": "hi and welcome back to a pink Lourdes kitchen today I'm going to be showing you how to make a dark chocolate almond bark right at home to start off with I'm gonna go ahead and go with the ingredients first and this is the type action would be using it's actually it around wafers that you get for this particular kind you can use morsels but what I've found is that these potato buns actually do actually a really good job so I went ahead and used a double boiler to melt all of it so the amount I have here is 12 ounces so that's about 340 grams and as you can see it's nice and smooth and then to this I'm gonna be using about half a cup of raw almonds that I went to actually and toaster and skillet and give it a rough chop so let's go and get the in greens all together mixed white now you particularly can actually use any kind of chocolate wafers if they have out there and this is something that's a particularly available pretty much at most arts and crafts supplies or even at your local grocery stores and this is what it looks like I hope you can see it we already ready with some parchment paper lined up so I'm gonna go ahead and spread this right now now these actually they don't take too long to actually set in the refrigerator and that's what I want to do next just go ahead and get now if you prefer not to get the salted chocolate wafers you can actually use a regular dark chocolate and then use some sea salt just lightly sprinkle on it something people prefer to use the sea salt that's actually come in a little place you can get the stores you could use that as well and you could use either or also if you used to use want to use you know different types of nuts you're more than welcome to whether it's gonna be pumpkin seeds or hazelnuts those are really good you could certainly do that but this actually does make a really good even gift you know once it's cool down and you've got it all you know broken up into little pieces you can you know get into one of these nice clear plastic bags and also give it to you know family your friends you know makes a really great gift so we all set right now I'm just going to go and pop this in the refrigerator until it you know comes all nice and set and then I'm gonna go and show you what it looks like alright I'm back I went ahead and as you know left the chocolate bark already in the refrigerator for it to cool down and set so I went ahead and you know cut it up actually pretty much broken up into smaller pieces as you can see this is what it looks like just show you what some of the insides look like I hope you can see it really well this is it so as you can see the chocolates nice and shiny nuts as you can see them so at this point you can actually go ahead and store this actually in a container and then you know if you want to keep it in the refrigerator just have it in a nice airtight container and as I said before you can also you know pretty much give this as a gift to anyone you know so I hope you actually enjoyed watching this video please give my video a thumbs up and please subscribe to my channel until then see you next time bye bye", "oapgj3Zjr3Y": "chocolate coconut tart this is a really easy yet fancy dessert recipe i came up with while experimenting with coconut fats coconut oil makes beautifully crumbly pastry crusts and coconut cream makes an exceptionally smooth chocolate ganache with a cooling mouth feel and totally incidentally this recipe is vegan that's just a bonus as far as i'm concerned i wasn't trying to make it vegan first thing is make the crust it's something between a short crust pastry and a crumbly cracker crust like a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams but this is not a fussy pastry it does not have to be precise half a cup of sugar 100 grams and then like 50 grams or half a cup of almond flour for some extra flavor and crumbly texture though you could use an equivalent amount of coconut shreds for example if you want to double down on the coconut thing you could replace this with just more ap flour or if you have celiac you could use solid almond flour for this now you could use cold butter but i'm using coconut oil virgin coconut oil like this gets you a nice subtle coconut flavor refined coconut oil will have almost no flavor at all and it should be solid like this at room temperature if it's not solid your kitchen is probably too warm chill the oil in the fridge before you cut it into the dough it needs to be solid i've got half a cup of coconut fat in there that's eight tablespoons about 110 grams last thing is salt i like to have a nice salty crust on a chocolate tart half a teaspoon of morton kosher is what i'm using that's two or three grams you could use more and you could throw all that into the food processor and just pulse it until it's like a coarse breadcrumb consistency or you could do it the old-fashioned way with a pastry cutter or a fork you just cut the tines of the fork into the big chunks of solid fat as you cut those chunks into smaller chunks they immediately get covered in flour and such which disperses the fat bits it keeps them from sticking together again it'll feel like you're doing absolutely nothing but keep at it and all of a sudden you'll have that coarse breadcrumb consistency if you can squeeze it and it just barely holds a solid shape that is done that is what gives you a crumbly or short pastry if you want something a little more flaky you can pick up handfuls of this and do that with them to squeeze out long sheets of fat coated in flour aka flakes but this will still be pretty crumbly because we're not actually going to roll this out and because there's no water in this dough coconut oil is nearly 100 fat unlike butter which is like 15 water that water reacts with gluten to make a more elastic dough there's no water at all in this so this pastry is going to be super brittle which is what i'm after it's like a graham cracker crust and you can simply mold this into a normal pie or cake pan it'll be delicious but you would not be able to cut out nice pretty slices for that you need a tart pan with a removable bottom these things are cheap and you can just lift the tart up out of the pan when it's done my recipe is calibrated for this pretty standard nine inch diameter size 23 centimeters or it could work with four of these mini guys that i'm going to use four and a half inches wide with these little ones each person gets their own tarts and there's more edge crust relative to the total volume which means fewer bites will be exactly the same heterogeneity i'm just pushing the crumbs into the molds my recipe gives you a very thick crust layer it's equal parts crust and ganache because that's what i'm into you can make less crust if you wanted try to push it into the corners and make sure it's not too thick down there in the corner it's going to melt a bit in the oven and slump down into the corner so if it's too thin in the corners when it goes in the oven it'll be just right on the way out you could use a measuring cup or a glass or something to really stamp these out smooth but i don't think that makes a really noticeable difference in the end and there's the four tartlets how was that not the name of a motown group we'll bake them empty at 350 fahrenheit 180c baking them on a tray will make it easier to get them out when they're hot and the tray will catch any melting pastry that would otherwise fall and burn now there's nothing really to do but clean up might as well listen to some tunes by this remarkable undiscovered talent on soundcloud i mean wow and he sounds great via the sponsor of this video cove audio whom i'll now briefly thank this is the cove commuter 2 just the best darn bluetooth speaker you can imagine it syncs with your phone or computer or whatever in a flash the controls are really simple and obvious and i wonder how this visionary soundcloud composer would sound in true wide stereo [Music] that's how amazing there's a 30 foot range between these two halves you can charge them simultaneously up to seven hours of playtime on a charge it's water resistant which is great for kitchen use there's a built-in microphone and it gets darn loud apart or reunited if you follow my link in the description you can save more than 67 on the commuter too making it far more affordable than any comparable speaker i've seen and remember it's basically a two-for-one deal because it has two speakers link is in the description for 67 off thank you cove after 15 or 20 minutes the pastry shells should be kind of molten and bubbly this is not the kind of pastry that will stick all the way up the sides of the tart pan so don't expect it to you could pull these right now or you could bake them a little longer until they brown a bit the browning tastes delicious but it can also drown out the subtle flavor of the coconut and it can make the pastry harder to cut with a fork pick your poison i will say if you want a stronger coconut flavor you could add a few drops of coconut flavoring to the dough or the ganache i tried that i liked it but lauren thought it tasted like sunscreen anyway you got to let these cool all the way down before you fill them wait until they're ready then make the ganache filling you could use a product labeled coconut milk or coconut cream i'm using the cream it's the same stuff as the milk except it will have more of this luscious fat floating in the can above the layer of coconut water at the bottom and i'm just lifting the semi-solid cream out of the can and dropping it into a microwave-safe measuring jug i'm looking for one cups worth 240 mils if you don't have enough of the cream to get you that much you can top it off with the coconut water you've left behind that's fine the more coconut water you have in there the more soft the ganache will be which is not an inherently good or bad thing now for the chocolate it's the star of the show so use a chocolate you really like either chips or chop up a bar into chunks ganache is generally equal parts cream traditionally dairy cream of course and chocolate you can easily measure that volume of the chocolate by displacement just mix in enough that you've got two total cups of stuff in there almost 500 mils but it does not have to be precise easiest way to make ganache is to just throw it in a microwave on like half power for a minute or two just long enough until you can melt it together i usually wait until i see the first signs of melting chocolate and then i take it out and stir it should look like it's not quite hot enough yet because if you keep stirring it and spreading around the heat it will go smooth at a surprisingly low temperature this is good because if you get it too hot it can kind of seize up and go grainy taste it you could call that done or you could put in a little dab of vanilla or almond extract or any flavoring you like you might also want it sweeter depending on your tastes and how dark your chocolate was to begin with you can stir in a little granulated sugar but it's safer to squeeze in a little syrup any syrup granulated sugar could give you a gritty texture don't make it too sweet because the crust is plenty sweet i think the filling should taste a little too intensely chocolatey in isolation this last step will be a lot easier if you do it directly in the fridge you just fill the tarts all the way to the brim it doesn't matter if you go higher than your walls of crust filling these in the fridge saves you from having to transfer them in while they're full and soft and sloshing around you would spill a lot look how pretty that is and then just chill these until they're solid a couple hours at least but they'll be firmer if you chill them overnight like i did there they are the next day now these are too cold for you to push the tart up out of its ring right now the crust and ganache is still stuck to the sides get yourself a wide flat vessel and pour in a thin layer of hot tap water stick the tart in there and within seconds that will melt the stuff clinging to the ring and you can easily lift the tart out get a knife in there to lever off the bottom piece or don't bother just serve it right on the base that water trick works great if you just left these on the counter until soft the whole tart would be too warm by the time you could de-pan it you could put some raspberries or something on there for fancy or not i prefer a light sprinkling of smoked sea salt crazy good you can also tap on a little bit of powdered sugar that's pretty but do it right before you eat because that thing is cold so there's going to be condensation forming on it which will dissolve the sugar and that looks kind of ugly i prefer the smoked sea salt now especially if you browned the crust it's gonna be a little tough to push your fork through because it's so cold and thick you might instead consider putting it on a cutting board and cutting it into little wedges like a wheel of brie just wipe the knife clean in between each cut this turns it into a finger food which makes it a nice thing for people standing around at a party or something that's just so tasty and again i feel like that coconut milk ganache has a cooling mouth feel as though it's working on my thermoreceptors the same way that something like mint does am i just making that up well you try this recipe and you tell me", "tNUCfnghs6E": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]

oil little vanilla I actually forget what else is in there but it's really basic ingredients super simple you can make them in cookie our candy molds which I do I go to the craft store and buy gobs of candy molds are so easy do not put them in the dishwasher wow these are good yeah pop them in the freezer these firm up in about 15 minutes keep them in the fridge keep them in the freezer and when do you eat fat bumps with the meal right after the meal as your dessert to allow you to go between one meal to the next without snacking okay just trying to eat the whole thing dirt good yeah really good just do one or two okay per meal all right let's show you how to make them okay you", "00sD_Y359xU": "hello I'd like to talk about almond milk today honey let's let me just do my thing okay hi guys hi we are back with another video on the our favorite keto products yes and so what was that yeah I just want to make sure we have one mic so we're sharing it today I think you should just I'll leave it on yeah I'll do all the talking okay so the first product is almond milk this is a really great product it's called Ellie's best bigger better nut milk bag easy to make it all by yourself we're going to take these almonds high quality almonds and then we're gonna turn into almond milk and what do you use almond milk for well I mean you just drink it you can drink it with your keto cookies I say that again no okay okay you drink you with anything your keto cookies we are gonna also be going over an amazing granola that we have you drink it instead of milk you can put it in your tea or coffee anything your shakes exactly I'm glad that you clarified that because people just don't know why to drink this stuff almond milk you know actual regular milk is becoming a big problem so this is a non dairy products oh the first thing we're gonna do guys you're going to taste take a cup of almonds and we're gonna soak it in water overnight and what that does is it germinates it so while Karen's rinsing this out go ahead and rinse that out Karen I'm gonna talk about what germinating is which you're soaking your nuts I'm sorry you guys so so Cleese things overnight you're getting rid of enzyme inhibitors so those are the things that block enzymes so now we can actually digest those things so it doesn't below you and I think one of the big problems is that for the gall bladder if you're consuming nuts with enzyme inhibitors you're gonna create a lot of gall bladder congestion so you're really making a lot of noise over there Karen but that's fine so we rinsed them out and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna blend them with water a blender four to four and a half cups of water for these nuts okay very good keep in mind when you're soaked in the nuts overnight they do swell so make sure your container has enough room this is a little over four cups of water it's interesting because I didn't know you had to dilute it that much but you do and then we're gonna add some so we're gonna even illah a half a teaspoon of vanilla and this is in this container because I make made my own vanilla last year in your spare time you know all my free time a little heavy okay okay and then a half a teaspoon of salt now this is Himalayan salt Himalayan salt the best yeah you can add a sweetener if you want to we don't drink our beverage is sweet almond milk coconut milk tea coffee so we're not gonna sweeten it but you could put some stevia or something like that in there okay now we're gonna make a lot of noise ready [Applause] well that was a long long ggest minute in the world long time when you're just watching it okay now what do we do okay so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna pour it in this nifty bag here awesome bag over a large ball we're basically gonna strain the mixture and we're gonna squeeze we're gonna squeeze it all out until the mixture inside is pretty dry so here we go it actually makes quite a bit of milk for just a small amount of almonds one cup this is like one cup of almonds this making all this milk this is awesome okay so now now you tight you can actually tighten the strings okay but you're still gonna have to squeeze the bag even if you tighten the strings right so you're gonna squeeze and twist I'm just gonna get all the liquid out of it it's a lot of good milk there and you know what's cool about this is you know when you buy in the store it comes with carrageen which a lot of people don't like that ingredient is it's kind of questionable but this has just basically almonds salt vanilla and water that's it and these are some high-quality wild harvested raw sweet almonds family farmed and they're natural which is even better so you know cuz the problem is if you consume these nuts just by itself they have enzyme inhibitors so it's hard to digest you have to either bury your nuts in the backyard and then germinate them or soak them overnight baby and soak your nuts [Music] all right good okay maybe we'll do another video on all your impressions Karen that's for another day another day so I don't I don't want to kwikki this but it does say keep going until the almond mixture is really dry so you've squeezed out all the liquid and we're getting there that's good I guess you could be perfect in all of this for the demonstration we're gonna end right there I think thank you good okay all right now what we have is we have our milk yes why don't we pour some in the air and test it out pour some in there and then okay great bring our back the pitcher back now it does say chill immediately before you serve so we're not necessarily gonna do that no because we want to show how it is to enjoy it right that's correct Kevin all right okay actually it's pretty good I read already tried it before but let's just pretend like we've never tried this back Hey hmm mmm that is good is wonderful and I think ice cold really good yeah amazing mm-hmm awesome okay good now let's go to the granola all right we're gonna try our next thing okay so now we're gonna do some granola okay Wow that's right this is a punch to the palate - the sugar and the violence it's really cool this company makes granola it's Tony keto friendly there's flavors a salted caramel brownie snickerdoodle cookie and that's another salted caramel they have different flavors and probably other flavors but my kids ate them all yeah we had a problem with that we have to hide this because my adult children they like to eat granola yet this is about the keto Baking Company I actually interviewed her so she basically does all this in a kitchen it's a community kitchen so it's a lot of work and let's go ahead and sample it Karen okay while you while we're pouring that and I want to tell you the ingredients so first of all it's extra virgin coconut oil no coconut a wreath rotol which is a really good sweetener almonds flax seed walnuts pecans unsweetened cocoa chips free-range eye so that eggs cocoa powder Himalayan pink sea salt grass-fed bovine collagen stevia natural flavours sodium bicarbonate which is baking soda okay what all those make sure you have this here so they can see so all of these ingredients together make a really really yummy cereal and granola you could munch it down out of a bowl like I have or have it with milk let's do it let's try it so not too much chewing you have the mic it's good it's really good you know and it's just nice I'm not a big bread person but it is nice to sit with a bowl of cereal I don't know if it's just in my head that that's comforting or wonderful but what's just in your head yeah it's a great it's a great experience this could be used as a dessert or possibly a meal you have to add some other things now when we try to make our home granola at one time we're looking at having some granola I'm a racer NOLA it was amazing yeah huge demands for migrants a big project but what was the flaw it's really hard to make it without oats mm-hmm so this is a winner guys this is a really good product we like this is another favorite product so now let's go to the next product okay all right so we got the next product this is called goodies goodies sugar-free sweetness so if pancakes brownies cookies that's right and you know what I like about this camp what no maltitol uh mommy likey and you know why no multi tall my tummy knows why yeah and has a glycemic index of like 53 that's like almost like sugar it's the worst why sugar as a sugar substitute it and all the sugar-free stuff but if it still jacks your blood sugar slide sugars um you know that's if I knew that would I be standing here right now probably not but anyway this is good almond flour it's great ingredients so we're gonna try these so we're not trying this we're not gonna be trying the pancake we're gonna be trying the cookies why is that because we made all the other ingredients when we already made the other packages and I just didn't as you say get around to it well the problem is keeping those in the house right right it was all we could do to have enough cookies to sample because our kids ate them all I had to hide them in a utility drawer seriously and then my daughter-in-law found them getting some batteries she's like oh these cookies okay well I'm glad you saved at least two so we could sample their sugar cookies yeah mm-hmm great yeah so for those people that need convenience is that pancakes cookies and brownies so there's a lot of people that like brownies mm-hmm you're eating faster than me so I'm sorry that's okay mm-hmm convenience it's good so remember guys this is your dessert it's not the meal this is not the snack something in your throat it's for it's meant to be like I better not put that back after the meal snack police will that's right okay look I like to make stuff from scratch but there are times I don't have the time for that I don't have the ingredients all you need is a pack of this and there's two other ingredients that's all that we added to these and I say we I mean me it was so simple it was so fast and goodies that's good news that's right awesome so let's show you let's let's go to the next one okay okay we're at the next product okay cauliflower crust okay so this comes in three different flavors we've got sweet red pepper we got the original Italian and then we have the spicy jalapeno oh that sounds great now you know first of all I like that they call cauliflower the new white flower because people are using cauliflower in so many ways and I dig it I love cauliflower it's my all-time favorite vegetable now and there's so many things that you can do with cauliflower it's off the charts and you just have to google and experiment you'll love it and it's true maybe you know we have our cauliflower pizza made from scratch and that's awesome just like anything made from scratch at home is wonderful but let's face it dr. Berg sometimes you don't have time to do that or you don't want to do it are you seeing some people like convenience are you trying to say that Lee they just want to go to their fridge they want to go to their freezer and they want to be able to pull out that crust and then still they're custom making it however they want to I dig that idea and I'm really glad these guys came up with it with the keto frame of mine well I think we should just want to make sure the biggest concern that most people have is it gluten-free let me just tell you the ingredients guys it has fresh cauliflower mozzarella cheese egg whites jalapeno garlic and chili flakes that's it and look how cute Amy is she's on she's on every box and she issues Dora ball right so with all of that how can it possibly be bad so let's free let's eat this let's eat it can let's see what happens beneath you know I didn't add my red pepper chili peppers was it for garlic which I always have to have that in the crust mm-hmm Wow she got she got that right mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah did you bring the napkins No you know look em mmm this is good mm-hmm you guys are gonna enjoy this make your homemade when you want to but have this in your freezer this means I need to sound pitchy but this crust is Italian oh the Italian it's sweet that's a nice little flavor mm-hmm she got that right mm-hmm mm-hmm okay that that's the thumbs-up right yep this is awesome good let's go to the next one we're gonna do another one all right we're at the next and last product review this is called cocoa perfection this is the probably the most ultimate very low very low carb if any it's like zero sugar type product on sharpen yeah it's awesome yeah it's very high quality so there's a couple flavors this is a whole bar and it is almond dark chocolate so if I open the bar you can see that it is a chocolate bar and you can see the almonds look how beautiful that is okay I don't think we're just simply gorgeous do you want to bite yep okay that one's for you these are big bites this is really amazing mm-hmm it's still high-quality mm-hmm it doesn't have that flat waxy tastes um I don't know it just seems like sugar alternative chocolates have all that same kind of flat not full rich chocolate taste but this has that amazing chocolate flavor it's a candy bar so we could basically do this as a snack right I'm gonna let you answer that that's it you know I feel like you set me up with that question is basically after the meal as your dessert and let me just tell you something Karen the first ingredient is dry cocoa solids roasted almonds chicory root fiber arethe rotol coconut butter and vanilla extract I mean that's it so a lot of times when you get these sugar-free bars it comes with maltitol and different sweeteners that give a lot of digestive issues oh and I can tell you I'm really sensitive to that and I did I'm sure you'd be shocked to know that I sampled these yesterday I am shocked I can't zero-zero effect it was a beautiful thing I mean I've tried these over the over the years and I keep coming back like this is like the top top one so if you want quality if you want something good this is it right and this flavor is chocolate mint no I don't know I remember growing up and going out to dinner to a steak house with my whole family and at the end of the meal you would get those little like I think that our Andes candies or something they're little chocolates and they're minty and I just hoarded everybody's joint your minute you want your mint you know this reminds me of that this is a little mint wafer chocolate wafer it is so lovely it is exactly that it's it's awesome look how little it is so they have the mint chocolate dark chocolate we have the orange dark chocolate orange chocolate and then the other one is just a dark chocolate a regular chocolate yeah it's pretty good I mean there's there's people out there that like chocolate I know that's hard to believe they there and they want to know if they can have chocolate yeah as long as this is low sugar this has a net carb of - so we're monitoring the fiber and two carbs not bad mm-hmm not bad so yeah if you're gonna do chocolate this is something you may want to try out have a little chocolate for a nice dinner or around the holiday if you ever put candy out this is the perfect alternative there you have it that's a review of our favorite keto products right enjoy them good good good probably got me probably doesn't matter but all this step on the cake please don't say a couple chains I'm good with that", "hXCwIcLRpoo": "hi i'm ron with braver guide thank you very much for watching today we're going to make keto salted almond crispy chocolate bars one of my favorite things to eat yours don't have to be keto ours are sugar-free but it'll be the same exact process so we'll use about twice as many chocolate chips these are milk chocolate you can use dark chocolate we have some sea salt and we just put a little sprinkle on the end i love this flavor of salt and chocolate these are some trader joe's sliced almonds we toast them up in a pan for a few moments once you smell that nutty aroma you can take them off gets a little crispier and these are some soy protein puffs kind of like crispy rice krispies maybe a little bit better for you so you also need the mold which i'll have a link in to amazon below and a spatula so here we go we have two ounces of chocolate chips we have roughly two tablespoons of almonds uh toasted two tablespoons of our soy crispies and a pinch of salt that we'll just sprinkle on at the end so i will heat these up in the microwave now for about 30 seconds so our chocolate chips just came out of the microwave i microwaved them for about a minute and would check every 20 seconds or so you don't want to burn them by adding the room temperature chips it'll give it a nice smoothy silky texture and just mix it until it's all melted and then you put it into the mold i think it's important to get it to the edges and what we'll do in a few moments once it's ready we'll put it into the refrigerator i put mine into the freezer for what should be about 10 minutes i don't think i've ever gotten past 7 before i've had to taste it and i think we're ready to go again once the ingredients go in the chocolate will move around a little bit so it doesn't have to be perfect perfect first we'll put in our soy again i like to get everything into the corners sometimes i'll use the back of a spoon to push it in but it may not be necessary may just melt in as you can see these are going in pretty easily and sometimes i'll break up the almonds just a little bit before i put the sea salt again i'll just make sure everybody's in nice and tightly hmm i'm getting very excited you may find your own technique and a little tiny bit of salt i don't know if it does anything i sometimes tap it down that's my own idea but here you go and we're headed to the refrigerator so the bar just came out of the freezer and we will pull the edges of it that'll break it out of the mold be sure to break anything that goes beyond the edge of the mold we have a delicious chocolate bar and now the taste test milk chocolate almonds crispies a little bit of salt delicious thank you for watching below we'll have some of the utensils all the ingredients links we'd love to hear what you'd like to see so please subscribe and please visit braverguy.com also please tell us what you're going to make in your chocolate bar thanks again", "uHRM6s5pI0s": "hey everyone this is Jane with Barlow herbal and today I have a special treat for you so over the last thirty years I have tried every pro team are out there the trouble that I found is that they're loaded with chemicals preservatives and too much processed sugar basically just a glorified candy bar so I set out to make some of my own I really wanted something that was healthy and I wanted something that gave me energy and they definitely had to taste good I have fine-tuned two of my recipes and I'd like to share one of them with you today so let's head over to my kitchen okay I'm gonna make my protein bars first thing I'm gonna start with is a big bowl I'm gonna put all my dry ingredients in here and then have a smaller bowl that all my wet ingredients are gonna go into so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this protein and I'm gonna put fifteen heaping scoops now this is a very high quality whey protein it's actually a grass-fed protein and this is sesame seeds but in one cup of sesame seeds so I'm actually gonna put in three cups of oatmeal and I like to use the fine rolled oats you can use the big rolled oats the ones that are if you like a chewier bar and this is raw pumpkin seeds I'm gonna do one cup of this so you can see this is actually pretty simple this is coconut shredded raw coconut and it's it's dry I really don't suggest that you use sweetened coconut and I use a full cup of coconut and then this is ground flaxseed and I use a full cup of ground flaxseed in fact almost everything here is a full cup this is raw sunflower seeds I'm gonna do a cup of that so that's a cup of coconut and this is chia seeds this is one of my favorite okay what I used to do with the chia seeds is I'll usually put a full cup and sometimes two cups but I'm gonna do a cup and a half today so there's all that no I have the brown black seed so what I really love is I love the look of whole flax seed so I've got some golden flax seeds and I actually have about a cup in this little bag and I'm just gonna dump the whole thing in here so the flax seeds are actually more absorbable in your body when they're like this but this makes for a really pretty bar plus you get all the fiber and all the benefits from whole black seeds as well and this is a real salt I would really suggest you use Himalayan sea salt or kosher salt or some really good healthy type of salt it's going to add some healthy minerals now what the salt does is this brings all the flavors together and I usually use three teaspoons and I just use my hand as a tea spoon you can actually measure this out if you like and then I add about the same three teaspoons of cinnamon and I just squirt that in and I just give a guess okay so the last thing I need to add to the dry ingredients is this powdered Madagascar vanilla and I will tell you in the link behind below this video there's a list of everything below where you can get all these because some of these you have to be sourced at different spots so this is a heaping teaspoon and I'm gonna actually do two heaping teaspoons of this vanilla this to me is like powdered gold because this is really really good vanilla and it makes your bars taste so amazing so here we have a big big bowl of the dry ingredients now one of the keys to this is to simply mix this up so that it's completely mixed because if you get a chunk of salt and you get a chunk of chia seeds you get a chunk of the protein from the bottom so one of your tips here is to make sure that this bowl of dry ingredients is completely completely blended okay so we've got all of our dry ingredients right here and they're blended perfectly ready to go and let me take this smaller bowl and I'm going to put three different wet ingredients so I have fresh ground almond butter I have coconut oil and then over here on the stove I have some honey that's been heated so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to take this almond butter and I use this full thing and then and then a half of another one which turns out to be about 6 cups so that's a lot of almond butter but this recipe has been tweaked in to perfection you have a whole big bowl there of dry ingredients that are going to need to stick together and this is this is the the love that sticks all those dry ingredients together and it puts them into a bar for you the best way to get the only butter okay I add 3 cups of coconut oil and this side eyeball you're totally welcome to measure this out in fact I would suggest so when you're first starting or if you're used to baking things and cooking things and you eyeball it like I do that's great as well now the trick that I have learned that makes all this go together is to heat the honey so what I've done here is I've hidden 2 cups of honey now when I first started this recipe I only did one cup of honey and I found out that with the amount of dry ingredients that this was not enough and as I was tweaking this recipe I actually did 3 cups of honey or cups of honey before I actually did more of the almond butter so if you like a sweeter bar you can definitely do more honey but I actually like a bar that has more of the buttery either almond butter or peanut butter than the sweetness so everything that I'm using here is organic I think it's really organic just because yeah you don't have any pesticides or herbicides you did everything that's natural if you're going to go through the trouble of making your own bar then I think it's actually a really really good idea to use everything organic so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the dirt the wet ingredients and I'm just going to pour them over the dry ingredients when I make this recipe with my grandkids this is one of the funnest things that they like to do is actually lick lick the spoon and lick the bowl seriously and if you don't like cinnamon you can leave that out I mean some people don't like cinnamon some people don't like coconut you can actually mix this stuff and you can add some different things I've actually played around with this recipe a lot I've got a chocolate chips I got a golden raisins I've three hydrating blueberries I've added craisins and goji berries and those are all really fun they make some nice chunky bars but this is the recipe that I've kind of settled that I really really really love and so it's very individual thing so this batch fills up two of these so you can make these as thick or thin as you want you could probably even fill up three these if you wanted to so I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take this and I'm gonna scoop out what I would guess would be about half I like to cut these pretty small because they're so dense they're so rich that usually when I reach for one I like a smaller chunk I get a sweet tooth I grab one of these and some of these I actually cut pretty little which are great that is a perfect bike you would not believe the way that this satisfies you they need to go in the refrigerator because of the coconut oil and it'll solidify and make your bar stick together and actually it's a lot easier to eat so here we have an amazing plate of the best snack protein bar healthy bar that not only do you know where all the ingredients they are so nutritious for you the recipe I just shared with you is what I like to call my almond coconut protein bars I really hope you take the time to try this recipe and who knows it might replace something that's less healthy and your diet wouldn't that be amazing now I know that many of you are not in a position to make these bars yourself for whatever reason you might be too busy you might not be able to get all the ingredients maybe you simply want to spend your energy elsewhere that's really ok because I have a solution for you starting today you can order these bars from Barlowe Herbal as I mentioned earlier I've developed two recipes the almond coconut and the chocolate coconut cashew and they're both amazing so whether you decide to make them yourself or buy them from Barlowe herbal I'm really looking forward to seeing how you like them please let me know what you think thanks everybody and have a great day we'll talk to you soon", "UjuI0Y6_65U": "what is going on everyone a beloved Eddy here and I am always looking for a low-carb treat so today I'm going to show you how to make salted coconut almond bark half a cup of coconut oil 1/2 a cup of unsweetened coconut chips half a cup of almonds hundred grams of baking unsweetened chocolate chin drops liquid stevia and then a quarter teaspoon of salt so the first thing you need to do is preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit after that you need to put the almonds and coconut chips and a foil lined baking sheet and bake for five to eight minutes after your almonds and coconut flakes cook have them cooled down and now we're going to prepare the chocolate so you're gonna need a small saucepan you're gonna melt down the chocolate and then you're gonna gradually add in the coconut oil and the stevia so once your chocolate is melted we're going to pour it into a pan that is lined with wax paper so before your chocolate cools down you need to sprinkle the coconut flakes and the almonds onto the chocolate and then your a sprinkle on some salt and now all you have to do is pop it in the freezer for 30 minutes so after it cools down pull it out of the freezer and break it up to small pieces and there you have a very low carb treat and for more videos like this for more athletes like me just keep coming back to body Bolcom [Music]", "IZIcmqZifBI": "[Music] hi everyone it's carolyn and welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be sharing with you four tasty easy and delicious and healthy breakfast options if you have pcos now these breakfasts are going to be the perfect combination of protein fats and carbohydrates that is going to keep you full all morning long give you tons of energy balance your hormones and most importantly they're going to taste amazing so before i get into the video i wanted to share with you some fun new kitchen gadgets that i got from my friends at kitchenmama these are their electric salt and pepper grinders and what i love about these is that they are a one hand technology there's no button that you have to push there's no crank that you have to crank you just flip them over and they use gravity to dispense the salt and peppers and you can even adjust the coarseness to a fine medium or coarse grind depending on your personal preferences so these are great for having your kids help you in the kitchen they're perfect if you're injured or maybe you have arthritic hands and what i love about them is that they're super easy to use you just tip them over and it dispenses your salt and pepper in the perfect quantities so i want to thank kitchen mama so much for sending these to me i'm going to be showing you how i incorporate them into my breakfast making routine throughout the video now it's really important for a pcos friendly breakfast to be very high protein this is going to help stabilize your blood sugars not only in the morning but throughout the entire day so i really emphasize protein in all of my breakfast but of course we want to include some healthy fats as well and some healthy carbohydrates and what i mean by by that is that they are full of fiber they're gluten free and they have very little sugar in them so that is sort of the basis of how i try and structure my meals but i have a lot of different options for you guys because i know it can get repetitive to eat the same thing over and over for breakfast so i really hope that these give you some great ideas and let's jump right in so the first breakfast that i'm gonna show you is one of my absolute favorites and i love it because not only is it going to fill you up and taste great but it only takes i would say less than five minutes to make as long as you have some hard-boiled eggs on hand which i had prepped earlier in the week i have some whole grain gluten-free bread and i like to save time by buying these individual packs of guacamole and seriously just see how fast i can throw this breakfast together [Music] my breakfast is done and it tasted so good i added in two of these breakfast chicken sausages as well for some extra protein in addition to the eggs on my avocado toast seriously i was full all morning long this gave me tons of energy and i also added some collagen to my coffee for extra protein in addition to my nut pods creamer so i seriously hope you guys give this a try you will not regret it next up i have this tasty and delicious corned beef hash now this came together so fast because yesterday was st patrick's day and so i had leftover corned beef and cooked potatoes however if you don't that's fine just grab a bag of those frozen hash browns from your grocery store and any leftover protein you have such as brisket or ham or my favorite is pulled pork so to get started i'm gonna chop up some peppers and i'm also going to dice up half of an onion i love sneaking vegetables in pretty much every meal and that includes any savory breakfast that i happen to be having so while i get these diced up i'm going to be preheating a skillet with just a little bit of olive oil and then i'm going to start by sauteing my vegetables while i prep the rest of the ingredients now i am using my leftover corned beef and potatoes like i mentioned i'm just dicing that up into bite-sized pieces now if i was going to be using frozen hash browns which i use all the time i would add those to the skillet while the vegetables are already sauteing but since my potatoes were already cooked i'm just adding everything in at the end because all it needs to do is warm up i'm seasoning it with paprika some garlic powder and a little bit of salt because the corned beef already has a lot of salt and pepper in it so here is my beautiful balanced breakfast it has everything that i need to keep me full and energized for my entire morning protein from the beef carbohydrates from the potatoes extra nutrients from the vegetables and then i have my collagen coffee over there that has even extra protein and obviously caffeine to give me energy so i'm gonna dig in and i hope that you give this a try seriously it's so good and it's just nice it's something that most people don't make so it's good to switch up your breakfast every now and then and try something new for breakfast today i have a tasty blueberry oatmeal along with a protein iced coffee drink that you are going to love even more than anything you can get at starbucks now i make my oatmeal with almond milk to make it extra creamy just make sure your oats are gluten free and i only season mine with cinnamon and a pinch of salt on my stove i'm warming up one cup of almond milk until it's simmering when it is i'll add in half a cup of oats and let that cook until it's absorbed brooke stop it while my almond milk is warming up on the stove i'm gonna go ahead and make my coffee i am making the yummiest tastiest iced coffee drink you're not gonna miss any of the sugar or dairy in it so i'm starting with this it's just black unsweetened cold brew coffee you can find these at most grocery stores and then to it i'm going to be adding this dairy free protein coffee drink so this has caramel coffee flavor that is super yummy it only has one gram of sugar it has 12 grams of protein so it is going to be so much better for you than those sugar-filled starbucks frappuccino type drinks seriously it's going to fill you up it is going to keep you full with the protein and it's going to taste so good [Music] my milk is simmering so i'm going to add in my half a cup of oats i'm going to add in a big sprinkle of cinnamon cinnamon is such a great anti-inflammatory spice to add and then just a dash of salt with my new salt shaker i'm going to give this a stir and just let it cook on medium-low until the liquid is absorbed and the oats are softened to my liking my breakfast is done and it only took about five minutes to make i can't wait to dig in i added a sprinkle of blueberries and some extra cinnamon my protein iced coffee is gonna be creamy and delicious i can't wait to enjoy it so that's it for today i'll see you tomorrow okay we're gonna be making our very last breakfast and this is one of my favorites because it seriously tastes like a delicious dessert so in my bowl here i already spooned in some yogurt i'm dairy free so i absolutely love this coconut milk yogurt it is really creamy but unfortunately it has very little protein in it especially when you compare it to something like greek yogurt that has a lot of protein as less than one gram so basically nothing so in order to get a good amount of protein in this breakfast i'm adding in a scoop of protein powder you can use you know any flavor you like obviously but if you're sensitive to dairy like me just opt for a vegan version because most protein powders contain whey and that contains dairy obviously so i'm just going gonna go ahead and mix this up and seriously it tastes like you're eating pudding it's so good and then i'll show you the toppings that i top it with that make it even better okay it's all mixed up how creamy and tasty does that look alright now for toppings i like to add in some unsweetened coconut flakes i absolutely adore coconut and the unsweetened ones taste just as good as the sweetened stuff i promise then i am adding in some cacao nibs now these are sugar-free um naturally sugar-free so feel free to go ahead and add them in there they give a great chocolatey crunch and they're filled with antioxidants as well and then for some extra crunch i'm adding in some gluten-free granola and i'm only doing about a tablespoon of all these different things you don't need a lot to get that flavor and crunch and then to finish it off i'm adding in a big handful of blueberries i love incorporating berries into my breakfast because they're a low glycemic fruit so they're not going to have as much of an impact on your blood sugar as something sweeter like bananas or mango or watermelon or something like that so berries are great feel free to add those in breakfast is ready this is seriously the fastest breakfast you can throw this together in like under two minutes one thing i did forget to mention when you are getting yogurt please please please opt for the unsweetened version yogurt is a sugar trap so many yogurts are just filled with sugar even more than like a candy bar so when you opt for the unsweetened version like this one for example has zero grams of added sugar this is going to be such a better option for you and it's really going to help you manage your pcos so much better than buying those flavored sweetened yogurts but this looks like it came out of a magazine how pretty is it with all the layers oops i missed a blueberry there now it's perfect and then of course i have my collagen coffee like i do every morning this is going to be a delicious high protein breakfast that again it's just going to keep you full all morning long i want to thank you guys so much for watching i hope that you found this video helpful and that you got some new ideas on how to switch up your breakfast routine i want to thank my friends at kitchen mama so much for sending me these electric salt and pepper grinders i seriously love them and i've been using them for quite a while now i'll make sure to have their link down in the description box if you want to go and check them out and maybe try them out of your own so leave me a comment letting me know which one of these breakfast options were your favorite and if you have any of your any other ideas make sure that you send them my way because i'm always looking to switch things up again thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in my next video bye guys you", "3xiH4kiWP9o": "my freezers downstairs hey guys this guy's and welcome back to my youtube channel today i'll be making a really amazing sweet treat for you guys they're actually really sexually salty caramel chocolate bars which raw gluten free but most importantly really really tasty so first up let's make that really biscuity base [Music] so as you can see I've just lined this loose bottom and it really does need to be loose bottom rectangular cake tin I'll pop the link below if you want to find one of these online so first up into the blender I'm going to add half a cup of pecan nuts half a cup of macadamia nuts to pop the lid on [Applause] feel free to add a cup of any nut you really like I really like macadamia nuts they got a nice sort of rich flavor and also the pecans just add another nice flavor to so I'm going to get them into this bowl make sure you get every little bit out so next up into this bowl I'm going to add two cups of almond flour or just ground almonds basically that's all they are almonds really helped create that sort of biscuity base that we're trying to get I'm going to add a tablespoon of peanut butter you can use almond butter if you want and this is actually my homemade peanut butter and the recipe for this can be found in my book full of other amazing quick essential recipes like that too next two tablespoons of coconut oil and I also add a pinch of salt now let's give this a good ol mix this can all be done in a blend if you wanted to but I just wanted to show you the sort of texture that I need you to get when making the base oh by the way my book is available to pre-order on Amazon now I didn't mention that before if you just type in vegan 100 or Gaza Oakley into the search bar on Amazon in any country around the world you'll be able to find it I nearly forgot to add a little bit of sweetness I'm adding 3 tablespoons of a gob nectar so when you get it to this texture you can see it starting to combine really well it's now time to get it into our lined loose bottom cake tin so simply just bundle it all in and compact it into the base it's using a spatula you can even bend the spoon if you've got a spoon this is to spare but using a spatula this fine and using your hands as long as they're clean and just so you know this is a 8-inch cake tin you can use it as a baking tray but it's just so much easier using one of these make sure you're pressing down the edges as well keeping everything tucked in nicely this serves well this makes around twelve to fourteen bars so you're going to make a good amount they're really rich you can keep them in the freezer for at least three months so you've got a constant supply of sexy sweet treats I need to stop saying sex once you've got it all level it's time to pop it in the freezer until we've made our caramel to go on top so I'm gonna pop this in now so to make the salted caramel we're going to be using these amazing dates which have been D stoned I'm using medjool dates and I've got 2 cups going into 1 in G cup next I'm going to add 1 cup of almond milk I've got 3 tablespoons of coconut oil 1/2 a cup of just filtered water pinch of Himalayan salt and now let's get this blended up and it'll turn into the most amazing salted caramel blitz it on high for about 1 minute let's see how good this looks oh wow look that golden goodness looks just like caramel looks amazing so I'm gonna give this a little try that is really good but because I'm calling it salted caramel I'm just gonna add a tiny pinch more of salt just give it one more blitz and then we'll get it on top of the biscuit base [Applause] so our biscuit base is mostly chilled and almost set and it's just time to get this amazing caramel on top the go thick that is that's the exact sort of consistency you want the reason why you need the caramel to be this consistency is because it doesn't freeze totally in the freezer because probably gives us a lot of sugar in the dates which is actually a bonus because you know you don't have to wait for it to defrost totally before eating them they're already nice and melted in the center so once you spoon this all over I made sure it's nice and level we want to get this in the freezer and make sure it's in there for at least three hours I'm happy with that so I'm going to pop it in the freezer it's time to get this out of the cake tin and it should just pop out like so it'll pop that on there and I'm going to cut it up into bars and then I'm going to get it back in the freezer whilst I make the chocolate and then we'll drizzle over the chocolate and they'll be ready to serve within half an hour so as you can see I've just been putting my knife in some hot water and that just helps me cut through it so all I want to do is just cut it up into some nice even bars like so just dipping my knife in each time to keep it warm so it just slices through to cut in so nicely and it's really crunchy the biscuit base I can feed it with my knife cut the rest of the bar then cut once through the middle carefully place the bars onto the tray ready to be coated in the chocolate place the tray back into the freezer for 30 minutes or until you've made your chocolate okay guys I've just got these out of the freezer so I'm just gonna put some pecan nuts over the top and as you can see the caramel remains really nice it doesn't go hard in the freezer it's nice and melted basically so you have to work quickly the pecans just add another little crunch another little bit of flavor and they look really nice underneath the chocolate so to make the chocolate all I'm going to do I've got a half a cup of coconut oil which is melted in there and I'm gonna add some raw cacao powder and it's just literally possibly about half a cup of that after really play it by sort of sight and see how it looks and you want to get that nice thick melted chocolate look and for sweetness I will add some maple syrup if you don't have maple syrup decide agave nectar obviously the caramel is really sweet so we're not going to need too much so when there's no lumps just need to add a touch of maple I know just go in with about a tablespoon give that a nice quick stir and that looks really really nice and I'm just gonna pour it over very very gently I actually like it when they're not fully coated it just adds a little bit of a rustic charm to it pour it over and as you can see it's already starting to set look how nice and shiny that is you have to move quite quickly because we've done it to melt the caramel too much I will put the full written recipe on my website and get all the good quantities for the amount of chocolate to make for the full amount of bars I just added the chocolate that was caught by this grease proof paper back into the bowl I'm just going to finally cover these to the best I can you want that nice crunch on the chocolate when they're set it's going to taste amazing so I'm gonna pop those in the freezer about half an hour and then I'll try them for you so guys here's the seven I coated it in the lovely chocolate you'll hear that crunch first look at this oh wow and look inside the car melted that is pill that I just love the shape of the pecan nut there let me give this a try mmm now it's really really good really really really good I think the only way I can really show the cameras how good these look just by cutting them open and holding them a few look come on guys come and have a look over those [Music] [Music] these just look so good I've just got to send

[Music]", "Sylz-N8hTng": "hey everybody Claire here and today I am so excited to share with you my Paleo birthday cake that's right it is my birthday this month I'm not telling you what age I'm turning so nice try comments um but anyway I'm making a paleo cake and I've really gotten into paleo baking recently paleo if you guys are not aware of it is basically sort of a diet um it's a lifestyle and essentially you cut out grains gluten which are part of grains dairy refined sugar and any weird stuff you don't really have anything that has preservatives or basically if you read the label and you're like really know what that is you probably shouldn't be eating it there's also other restrictions as well but that's kind of the breezy broad strokes of it but anyway I'm making a birthday cake that is grain free and sugar free and dairy free what I know it's a lot how can you even have a cake without those things well I am here to show you how and I'm really excited about this because it is a vanilla almond coconut cake with a ridiculous chocolate fudge frosting it's going to be fantastic and this is what I have to basically put the cake together so basically for the cake I'm removing gluten which is the protein in wheat that gives baked food structure so I don't have gluten in this because I'm not using any grains so what I'm using to provide structure are eggs so I have six eggs and in paleo baking you'll find that there's like a lot of eggs going on and that's because not only does it provide richness and moisture but egg whites also provide a good amount of protein and structure so I have six eggs and then to bind it together I have a cup of almond flour and a half cup of coconut flour so this gives us sort of an almond coconut flavor but it also provides sort of the crumb a little bit more of that richness and moisture but this is the basis of our cake for the fat I have one cup of coconut oil and then for the sugar because I'm not using refined sugar I'm using maple syrup and I have one cup of maple syrup and then I have one big tablespoon of vanilla extract because I love vanilla I have a quarter teaspoon of sea salt half teaspoon of baking soda and then to just really add an elimination point to that almond coconut flavor and also to provide a little bit more moisture in richness I am using almond breeze almond coconut milk it's unsweetened because I'm using the maple syrup and what's great about this is it just adds that really fantastic almond and coconut flavor and I'm partnering with almond breeze to just create a bunch of really fun recipes over the summer and this is one of them and I'm so excited about it because who doesn't love birthday cake all right well let's get started so to make the cake it's actually really simple it's a two-step method and a two-step method is when you do all the wet ingredients all of our ingredients and then you just sort of mix them together so I guess it's technically three steps but it's known as the two-step method anyway so getting started with the wet ingredients first we're going to whisk together all of the eggs next I'm going to pour in my one cup of coconut oil then one cup of maple syrup and then I'm doing a quarter cup of the almond breeze almond coconut milk and remember it's unsweetened because I'm already using maple syrup and this gives the cake a little bit of moisture and some really fabulous flavor and so now my wet ingredients are completely incorporated so I'm not going to mix together all of the dry and the reason why I'm mixing it up is because I do not want there to be a pocket of baking soda or a pocket of salt I just want to make sure everything is really well integrated just gives the ingredients a chance to do their best all right so it's time to combine so I'm gonna add in the wet just all at once the one nice thing about baking gluten free it just means that you don't have to worry about overworking the gluten when you bake typically with regular flour you want to make sure that you're really gentle with it because otherwise you can get cakes that are kind of rubbery and don't have a great texture but with this you don't have to worry about it as much so everything's been really nicely mixed together and I have basically two cake pans and I've lined them with some parchment paper and then also greased them with a little bit of coconut oil and the reason why I do this is because when I'm using this many eggs eggs are very sticky so they stick to pans a lot so using a good amount of oil but also having the parchment paper in there it's just an insurance policy to make sure that my cakes do pop out so the cakes are ready to pop in the oven I've preheated the oven to 350 degrees and these are going to bake for about 20 to 25 minutes this should be golden brown kind of pulling away at the edges but then also they should be firm when you put your fingertip on top of it it shouldn't sink in and dip too much it should kind of bounce back a little bit so the cakes are out of the oven and you can see they bounce back they look gold and brown they pull away at the edges and here's the best part why that's right that's right the miracle of parchment paper love it so you can see that these aren't super thick cakes and that's totally fine they have a really dense almost pound cakey texture which is really delicious I have over here the ingredients to make my chocolate fudge frosting so the base of that is smooth almond butter so I have 1 cup of the almond butter 2/3 cup of maple syrup 1/4 cup of coconut oil and coconut oil does harden up if you put it in the fridge so if you want this to be really sort of thick and fudgy then put it in the fridge for a minute I have a tablespoon of vanilla extract and then I have about 8 ounces so a cup of melted baker's chocolate so you want to use baking chocolate because it doesn't have any sugar in it it's completely unsweetened chocolate so try to find the best chocolate you can use because this is really where all the flavor comes from and you want to make sure it's unsweetened so you don't have any refined sugar in there and then I'm using my almond breeze almond coconut milk and this is unsweetened because I have the maple syrup adding a little bit of sweetness so we're basically just going to whip this up in my mixer and just look for it to have a really smooth beautiful texture and then I'm going to start frosting my cake Wow and that got really thick so this is thick because of the coconut oil kind of hardening up and the chocolate as well but if it's a really hot day outside for some reason it looks a little thin make sure just to pop it in the fridge or freezer and then it'll definitely harden right up so to thin this out a little bit I'm going to add some almond breeze almond coconut milk my frosting is done it looks so delicious oh my goodness and this is very chocolatey so if you don't want it to have like a dark chocolate flavor just use less chocolate or more almond butter and it'll kind of balance it out a little bit so let's start frosting the cake I'm just gonna take some of the frosting and dollop it in the middle so I'm going to do a couple giant scoops and the frosting at least to me is just one of the stars here so I really want to make sure there's a lot of it because this is the center layer I'm just going to kind of smooth it out just make sure it's all even so now I'm going to add the next layer right on top sandwiching in it and I'm going to keep this as a naked cake I just love the fact that you can see the golden brown edges and I think it makes it look a little bit healthier pretty beautiful oh my goodness I also could do this for a million years when you have just really like delicious kind of gooey frosting mmm so I'm going to do some nice little sticky zags now it looks beautiful I think just to play up the almond coconut aspect I'm also going to decorate it with a little bit of coconut flake just around the edges this can be kind of rustic okay happy birthday to me all right all right well it's time to have a slice of this cake it is very necessary I cannot wait oh my gosh this frosting looks so good I mean to be honest isn't cake just sort of a conveyance for frosting all right oh yes oh that looks so pretty I cannot wait to give this a try Oh ma'am Wow that is so delicious that makes me so happy what I love about this is the entire cake is grain free refined sugar free and dairy free it is so delicious you do not miss it because every ingredient in here is fantastic and I love the subtle almond and coconut flavor that you get from the ingredients and from the almond breeze almond milk it's really delicious and a little extra crunch of coconut on the edge is really nice too all right mmm so the well I hope you enjoyed watching me make this fabulous cake it is so delicious I hope you enjoy making it yourself at home and for more fun ideas like this one make sure you check out almond breeze comm and check out my blog the kitchen kitchen calm well see you guys next time bye you", "DuV8oYnh3XA": "Hey there, Lacey here with A Sweet Pea Chef. And today, I've got seven layers of delicious,\nunrefined, sweet goodness. I've partnered with Bob's Red Mill to bring\nyou some delicious paleo seven layer bars. So let's get started. Go ahead and start by preheating your oven\nto 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and line a square baking dish with some parchment paper. For our first layer, we are gonna be making\nan almond meal crust. So in a large mixing bowl, add Bob's Red Mill's\nalmond flour, pure maple syrup, coconut oil. We're gonna mix this together until it all\ngets nicely combined, and you're gonna want it to be a dough that it sticks together when\nyou press it. Now, transfer this mixture to our prepared\nsquare pan, and we're gonna press this into the bottom using our fingers, or a spoon. You want it to be an even layer across the\nentire bottom of the casserole pan. Now, transfer this to the oven, and we're\ngonna cook it for about 14 to 16 minutes. What we're looking for is for it to come lightly\ngolden brown around the top. Then, remove it from the oven, and we are\ngonna add our second layer which is chopped macadamia nuts. We're gonna go ahead and put it all around\nthat top almond crust, and we're going to press it in using our hands very gently so\nit just kind of sticks in there. Over our macadamia nut layer, we're gonna\nadd some unsweetened shredded coconut for our third tasty layer. Go ahead and just spread this out as evenly\nas possible. Then, add a layer of dark chocolate chips,\nand make sure to get a high cacao percentage. Seventy percent or higher is the best for\nthe least refined sugars, and the most beneficial for your health. Now, we need to make our salted caramel sauce. So, in a pan over medium heat, we're gonna\nadd some coconut oil, and pure maple syrup. We're gonna stir this together until it's\nfully melted. Once it's nice and hot, we're gonna add in\nsome almond butter, and then whisk that in until it's very smooth. Then remove this mixture from the heat, and\nthen we're gonna stir in some vanilla extract and a little bit of sea salt to make it a\nsalted caramel. Drizzle this salted caramel sauce over the\ntop of the dark chocolate morsel layer on our seven layer bars, and then top that off\nwith a layer of chopped almonds. For our final layer, we're gonna be making\na homemade condensed coconut milk, which has two ingredients. So in a sauce pan over medium high heat, we're\ngonna combine full fat coconut milk with some pure maple syrup. We're gonna bring this mixture to a very low\nboil, and then reduce the heat to medium, and what we wanna do is simmer for about 15\nto 20 minutes until it reduces by about a half. It's gonna become a very thick, dense, delicious,\ncondensed coconut milk for us to use. Now that it's nice and reduced, we're gonna\ntake that and pour it over our seven layer bars to make our final layer. And in order to evenly spread out our coconut\ncondensed milk, just go ahead and pick up the casserole dish, and kind of move it around\nto get all of it to go everywhere. Now, return the pan to the oven, and we're\ngonna cook it for about 25 to 30 minutes. What we're looking for is for it to become\nbubbly around the top, become a little golden brown, and just be all delicious and tasty. Then, remove it from the oven and allow it\nto cool to room temperature, and then you can either refrigerate it or you can freeze\nit. Freezing is a little bit faster, but refrigeration\nworks fine. Once it's nicely set and cold, we're going\nto cut it into squares. So these paleo seven layer bars make a great\ngift this Holiday season, and show someone that you care about their sweet tooth and\ntheir health. Thanks so much to Bob's Red Mill for sponsoring\nthis recipe. Definitely pick up their almond flour so that\nyou can make these delicious paleo bars today. Thanks so much. I'll see you next time.", "GmiknrUOJ5M": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying five different gourmet snack bars these are made by Sanders fine chocolate ears and Sanders is located in Michigan Sanders is in Michigan so I have the milk chocolate potato chip the milk chocolate coffee and pretzel no chocolate crispy almond coconut milk chocolate physics prep for pretzel pretzel Graham and the milk or dark chocolate cherry granola let me tell you the difference in the prices right these two were bought at the world duty-free store in the airport they were $2.99 each these three were bought at Plum Market in the airport and they were 349 so 50 cents more if you didn't go to the duty-free shop that's these were the only ones that the duty-free shop had so what do you want to try apartment you wonder it okay so this is the milk chocolate potato chip bar it one bar is 43 grams and it's 220 calories for the whole thing I would think they would all be different so I didn't know what to expect them to even look like but it's oh that's neat it's a X on the bottom and it says Sanders only how many pyramids triangles triangles broken you probably complete in the middle that looks like a big potato hit right there mm-hmm-hmm you get that you get to get chocolate player mm-hmm but needed to get this greasy potato chip lever there good hmm don't you a little more salt but they're good yeah I like that thank you I like the crunchy potato chip in them hmm yeah it's not mushy it's it's going have the friendship potato chip and the salt and the milk droplets very good as we already know that's why yeah that's good just if you have to like that kind of green EEP damn sure clever yeah we did which are you milk chocolate toffee and pretzel this is 220 calories so the rib is Martinson out of all of them this is the one that I'm looking for - Oh Matt yeah just because we really like coughing yeah and once again it should have it should have a some pretty good sized chunks enough hey I broke it right it should have a nice salt content hopefully I taste the pretzel mm-hmm turning a coffee mm-hmm that means that's good but I think today again it's extremely sweet hmm I'm wondering if the top he isn't just mixed in with the milk chocolate because I didn't get just coffee I mean I'm sure it's in here same thing although that looks like pretzel um you get pretzel I still really like that even though I the top he wasn't distinct I still think it's a really good bar you try miss it if it wasn't in there this one is 230 calories which surprises me it's a milk chocolate crispy almond coconut hey I guess the almonds increase the calories by 10 the veggies really surprises me okay oh it's just be good calories oh this is a healthy game oh I'll take that duck for the whole ball mm-hmm yeah the whole planet look at the home I've got coconut but it was much much lighter than what I ever expected and the coconut you get is that almost tastes like a bag coconut looking bad it's like they used an extract and didn't use actual shavings I can feel a coconut right did you know but I watched the attic and get any of that so for me I'm getting the liked flavor of it but I didn't get any like shreds of them probably thanks good no that's good I'm glad that it's in there it's like they're good sweetened coconut tastes like just raw coconut yeah yeah that's the flavor I got a wild cousin I like what we all yeah that one's okay yeah probably it's just all right I wouldn't necessarily get that one damn this is interesting to me this is the creek so Graham so it looks like it's a bit uh you're horrible so it looks a seeming that means that it's a pretzel one hey grandpa record with some salt on hmm because a grant for a girl ever and then you get a little salt - hey do get a little bit of a big protein it has cinnamon oh I actually really like them despite it looking like where it has ringworm no that was good it's actually really good I like some cinnamon targets no my don't but that one's medusa yeah I've told you all this before cinnamons not one of those things I want all the time oh it wouldn't be in all the time bar for me but it's still a very delicious bar that I would get him yeah I want them there once this one I can read it's big it's $200 it is the dark chocolate cherry granola so is this business are only dark chocolate yeah and they I think they make a couple other of these and I could be wrong but I was thinking I saw I'm gonna website a couple of other ones but these are the only ones that we saw at the airport stuff yes it is yes lumpy bumpy the granola that's very crumbly mm-hmm I'm gonna be honest I don't like I don't get worried though the chemical it tastes like something you would spray in the air to air freshmen I was thinking but that's a better description I was thinking very medicinal yeah cherry but it's even more what Kevin seven yeah like you spray it in the air then you takes a little bit of it because it comes knocking yeah truly that like I don't care I'm gonna walk by that one at all no yeah I didn't mind the texture though I like the crumbly granola feel I didn't like that cherry in the dark chocolate didn't they just didn't go together I don't it's my favorite by any means that texture I really have yeah yeah I can't I can't recommend that it makes it it makes it very very crumbly like something's wrong with yeah I don't I just uh I probably won't even pass that on to anyone no I don't know anyone that will want that so that was 350 going now that was definitely my least favorite yeah now my second one's probably gonna be that coconut one the coconut is my second least favorite and then if we're going well I was just you know work that way the crystal would be my third and I grew with you and then coffee I'd say the topic pretzels number one in the potato chips my number two I'll agree with you yeah yeah I'll go in the potato chip is good but it's a very distinct flavor so I don't know if I want that all the time but it's gonna spend three dollars expense I would get the toffee yeah it's called no chocolate toffee and pretzel I would get that that's the best one and it's not a really good flavor to it and it's good texture it says yeah it is safe it's not weird but if you don't like potato chips good for them because they're really good too yeah potato chip is good but I would totally pass on that cherry yeah no chairman I never mind even if you like dark chocolate it's not the chocolate it's actually the flavor of the cherry that's really no it's just not a good and the coconut one which is kind of bland that's why that's kind of my last one yeah there was nothing wrong with the coconut but yeah I don't think either ones it is pointer yeah so so yeah I hope you all enjoy the video if you've seen any other of these bars you can tell me about them we don't get them around here so it's not like I'm gonna have the opportunity to get them but you can always let us know if you've tried them on what you thought of them in the comments below and thanks for watching", "pCltEHaVPFA": "- Hello everyone, welcome\nback to my channel, Eat Burn Sleep. I'm Yalda, and today I'm in my kitchen. I'm going to show you\nhow to make dairy-free, grain-free, gluten-free chocolate and sea salt brownies. This recipe has been on my blog at eatburnsleep.com for a while. So many of my followers have\ndone it, but some haven't, and you might not have,\nso I wanna show you how simple they are to make,\nand they are so delicious, you're gonna prefer them\nto traditional brownies. So for the ingredients, we need two eggs at room temperature. We need some sea salt. Here I have 130 grams or half a cup of melted but cooled down coconut oil. Next, I have 80 grams\nor one-quarter of a cup of cocoa powder. Here I have 80 grams\nor two-thirds of a cup of ground almonds. And finally, I have 200\ngrams or one cup and a third of coconut sugar. So we're going to start. You can do this with a whisk\nin a bowl or with even a fork. We're gonna start by cracking the eggs and beating them with the coconut sugar. So I'm gonna add the coconut sugar next. Next, I'm going to be\nadding in the ground almonds and I'm also putting a good pinch of salt. Actually, at this point I'm\ngoing to change the handle. And I'm going to add\nthe melted coconut oil, as well as the cocoa powder,\nbut I'm going to do this whilst it's not beating so\nit doesn't go everywhere. And by the way, you need\nto preheat your oven at 175 degrees Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit. So now I'm just going to use a spatula to put everything in the middle and help mix further properly. It seems that my hand\nis doing a better job. This is now ready to\ngo in a brownie's tin. So what I do here is grease the tin with a little bit of coconut oil. So now I'm just gonna pour the mixture in. I'm salivating, I want to lick the bowl. I used to love this when I was a kid. My mom would bake and she\nnever said things such as, \"There are raw eggs, don't have it.\" like I sometimes say to my children. I would just have it all. What you can do is this. It will spread it everywhere and evenly. Now we're going in the\noven for 18 minutes. I'm gonna set the clock at 18 minutes. There we go. Now that this has cooled down,\nwe're just gonna lift it, place it on a board, you take\nsome sea salt to decorate. And we're going to, just going to cut it. It's not perfect, but it's all right. You know I'm much more\nabout taste than looks. There we go, mm. Let's give this a try. Oh my god. I'm so happy that I have managed to come up with so many recipes which are grain-free and dairy-free so I can still enjoy sweet treats. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. This is delicious. You do not need that much,\nand with a cup of coffee, it is just perfect. Thanks so much for watching. Please do subscribe to my channel.

one is sugared almonds and then the blue one is coconut macaroon wonderful these are speculoos so um i'm going to read you what maria said she said i know that you have ritter sport in the usa yeah yes uh they're originally made in berlin every year you'll get some limited editions in the summer and winter this year's winter editions are and those the ones that we just told you she said one square is 30 calories so this is the sugared almonds the squares there's a nice almond flavor nice chocolate and one pieces it's a big piece it is a big face it's bigger than what like a hershey's kiss would be it's more chocolate than that well a hershey's kiss is like 22 calories or something this is 30 calories yeah that's a little bit bigger it's a little bit bigger that's really good though the almonds are plentiful and where they're sugared almonds they have like a crunchy there's like a crispiness to the almonds themselves so you get more of a you know a regular nut usually it's not soft but it's softer once you've crunched it it's kind of softer right turned into a paste like yes so that is very good so now let's try the coconut macaroon you could open it you want me to open it no that's fine i think i thought broke at the wrong point [Applause] these are a little softer squares oh yeah i'm sure so when you break them they kind of smoosh a little bit they got a filling inside of them hmm that coconut's excellent love love the coconut the texture is gritty it's gray sugary [Applause] super i mean that's sweet yeah that's a sweet sweet sweet coconut that is like that's excellent they took it's i didn't get any shreds of coconut i got little pieces look they're very tiny yeah they're not bad it's like they ground it up because it's not like long shreds like i've had in other things it's like they ground up coconut and put it in a bowl and pour lots of sugar on top of it and you have this gritty gritty paste and then mixed it with cream yes and put it in that chocolate that is awesome that's one of the better chocolate i mean coconut things i've had in a while yeah i love that that is absolutely yes i have five out of five delicious yeah um it's really good even as good as the sugared almonds were there they don't stand a chance to that coconut no it's so good so now this is the speculators yes and this has a like a butter like a speculoos cookie butter in the middle maria just wrote a cinnamon a ginger cookie with cinnamon it's filled milk chocolate with cocoa based cream refined with refined with winter spices and a spicy shortbread biscuit and you get the crunch of that biscuit in there that's what that brown was i thought it was a cream but it's not a biscuit it's crunchy that's a very nice flavor if you like a cinnamon yes cinnamon flavor after that coconut though it seems pale in comparison the cinnamon is you can definitely taste it but it's not overloaded so it doesn't burn your mouth or anything like that that's a nice speculoos flavor it doesn't come across as just cinnamon powder it has that milk chocolate sweetness to back it up it's got some other spices in there too to mix with them yeah it's very nice it's not it's it's one i wouldn't want to eat all the time but it doesn't hold a candle to the uh you cannot compare to that um no uh coconut the coconut macaroon is phenomenal it's the best one here it's probably one like i said it's probably the best one i've ever had yeah it's it is delicious yes no okay so you like that more than like a bounty bar um yeah that's i like the chocolate and the texture of that better than a melody because the bounty is more like a um an almond joy or a mounds it's basically the same thing right um they have a darker chocolate right this has a really sweet milk chocolate and it has a grittiness to it that those those candy bars don't have yeah they're just really cooking that dipped in chocolate even though they're really good candy bars they don't have that this sugary grittiness right uh so yeah stock up on those while they're selling them yes yes this would be one uh to get if you see them absolutely try them out um maria thank you so much for sending them to us i hope everyone enjoyed the video and thanks for watching you [Music] you", "hujMO8BWQZs": "hi guys welcome and today I'm going to show you how to make these almond clusters and I'm going to be needing some chocolate really good quality chocolate and some elements and these dry roasted elements I buy from Costco which are so perfect to use and some salt if you want if you need so first we're going to do the double boiler where you heat in some water in the pan and put a glass bowl over to melt some chocolate so I'm using a bark so I'm going to be chopping up some chocolate and if you're going to use chocolate chips the good quality go ahead use that and we're going to put it in the bowl to melt the chocolate and once that's all done you hear you kind of have to go by how much chocolate you melt that's how much you need to put the almonds so put enough it's really two how much you want and here it kind of has to be sticking the spoonful in here on the pan I've placed parchment paper just so it doesn't stick go ahead and scoop it in here if you want you can add salt but I recommend not putting it if you're not going to eat them within a day or two otherwise it's going to become whitish in color so don't put salt if you're now going to eat them within two days so then just spoon some out just make sure they're touching each other you know the little circles that you're going to be making that way it's going to become still leave it room temperature to cool off if you put in the fridge the chocolate might change in science stuff might not work so well so leave it room temperature to harden completely and here it has hardened completely and they're just wonderful they taste like store-bought so yeah as you can see they're all done so and we made a bunch of these because we have a big family and that we're going to be sharing with so all righty thank you all so much for watching please subscribe and like in next till next time", "MAh5X0yvlq0": "today kevin and i are gonna be trying some keto bars these are by the brand elevation which is an aldi brand these were actually 5.99 a box at aldi and you get four bars in the box for 5.99 uh this is the chocolate almond brownie the salted caramel pecan i have the chocolate coconut macaroons so they're not a bar it's a bar oh it's a bar it's just headphones but they have microphones on the front so yeah it has macaroons on the front but it's a bar it's a bar yeah see they have caramels on the front of that one yeah they just tricked you it's the picture of the bar is on the back yeah um okay so this is the lowest calorie one the chocolate almond brownie it is 180 calories and i've tried to open it like they want you to open it there we go you do only get four of these though so i they could have definitely fit more in this box um it is gluten-free natural mcts from coconut oil 2 grams of total sugars 3 grams of net carbs it's very soft they're made in canada you must design a coffee you know what i get coffee too i think it's delicious it's okay i i don't know the texture at all the texture is kind of a soft almost like a brownie not quite gooey but you know the way that they have you open the box i'm not gonna open the other ones like that because you're tearing right through the ingredients and i can't read it now um but it tastes like coffee i i i doubt it says coffee i love the texture texture's good i think it's really delicious keto or not keto see this is one of those things that if you don't have a keto lifestyle you probably aren't going to buy because you're thinking oh that's just for keto people well but in the end it's just 180 calories you know it's just another bar and so that's the good thing about doing this chant having this channel is we do buy lots of different things because i would have never known i get those ones i think those are very nice bars i would i would totally uh buy those again yeah they're not on the sweet side that's for sure but i think they're good elevation keto bars are carefully crafted using premium ingredients uh check out the macro nutrients friendly fat friendly fats high fiber optimize protein levels and minimize carbs to support your keto and carb conscious eating plus you won't believe how great they taste this is 190 calories and it is the salted caramel pecan yeah i'll actually keep those keep those bars i won't give them away because i think those are good this one's a heavier ball say it feels better it's the exact same white it might just feel heavier yeah it is a more calorie though it's uh same thing two grams of total sugars three grams of carbs i have net carbs 190 calories so 190 calories is the calories for a normal your typical bar anyway that one the texture it's not bad it's a little pasty yeah it's got like little chunky pieces out mm-hmm yeah it's not bad it's really it's like a soft coconut or something like that yeah yeah it kind of has that kind of chunky the it's it's smooth but it's chunky at the same time um it's not as chunky as like a chunky peanut butter but it but it's a little chunky the flavor is good i like the flavor with the flavor nice yes it's sweet once again i wouldn't have known it was keto necessarily because we've had some keto stuff that's been some stinkers you know so these are actually really good i still like the uh chocolate almond brownie better i would never call that chocolate almond brownie i would call it chocolate coffee yeah uh but um i like the flavor of the caramel better but i don't i don't like the texture as much so yeah i know the texture's not bad it's not bad but it is a little different this that wet paper towel kind of texture it's it could have gone that way yeah it did for me um this is the chocolate coconut macaroon same thing two grams of total sugars three grams of net carbs 190 calories just like the ones before it it's funny normally i like the highest calorie thing today um so far i like those 180 calorie bars they look just like they do on the back of the box which is pretty cool because a lot of things don't i like those that's my favorite is it i still the texture is one of those things i would get used to but you don't like it it's my least favorite really you know why because this coconut is i love coconut but it's very very intense it is i like it so it's coconut the coconut and the salted caramel have the same texture they have that um kind of grating yeah chunky texture yeah they have that texture um yeah it's a very intense coconut i don't mind it but it would definitely be my last choice i would buy the the chocolate almond brownie that would be like all the time yeah we're just on opposite ends today um yeah and like i said earlier i'm surprised that the lowest calorie and i know it's only 10 calories but normally if it's high calorie i'm there for it so it surprises me that this is my favorite of the three but the texture was better for me and everything in this bar i think that one i think that would have kind of the same texture it's just it was covered up a little bit by something i don't know yeah but it must be because the this one has like little nuts on it the other ones don't i don't know well they the the sausage caramel has pecans but you're right they're not as chunky um but i don't think i got a pecan in my bite i see them now and then the the coconut you really don't get anything except coconuts yeah except for coconut yeah but i tell you what that coconut it's still in my mouth it is a very intense flavor i think if you're a keto you should run flat out i think if they sound interesting to you whether you're on keto or not you should try because like i said at the end of the day it's it's just another bar it has this about the same calories as a nature valley bar or any other bar so why not get them you know why not give them a try and see more expensive uh well that's true they are yeah you're right they are six dollars a box so that might keep you from trying that's very true so if that's an issue then don't try um but i will have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] bye", "2sntlT_nOKM": "- With all of the healthy\neating and meal prep that you guys have been doing, I thought you deserved\na sweet treat this week. So I'm happy to share the\nrecipe for my paleo brownies. They are rich and chocolatey\nand fudgey and delicious, soft and warm straight out of the oven, but if you wanna get\ncreative for Valentine's Day which is in just a couple of days, you could also add a scoop of ice cream whether dairy or dairy-free and a homemade strawberry sauce on top and I will show you how to make that, but I also wanna say a\nquick word on sweet treats and desserts that are\nlabeled paleo or gluten-free or vegan and remind you that many times these are still loaded with sugar and not exactly healthy. Occasional indulgences\nare definitely okay, but I wanna make sure that\nwe're not fooling ourselves into thinking that some of these items are healthier than what they are. Alright, so with that disclaimer, let me show you how to make\nthese delicious paleo brownies. Start by pre-heating your\noven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then get all of\nyour ingredients ready. I know many of you in Europe and other parts of the world\ndon't have refrigerated eggs, but for those of us in the U.S. who do because of how\nour eggs are processed, you wanna get your eggs out of the fridge so that they can come to room temperature. Add a half a cup of coconut oil and one cup of chocolate chips to a bowl. If you're not dairy-free,\nyou could also use butter or ghee instead of the coconut oil. We want to melt these two items together and you can do that either in\na double boiler over the stove or in a microwave oven. If you do use a microwave, just heat in 20 second increments until the chocolate is mildly\nwarm and melted, but not hot. And make sure to give it a stir in between each 20 second increment. (optimistic music) You'll need an eight inch by\neight inch square baking pan for the brownies and I line\nmine with parchment paper so it's easy to lift the brownies out. Now a quick trick with the parchment paper is to measure it about the\nwidth of your baking pan and instead of using\nscissors to cut it to size, just fold the sides in to get it to fit. This keeps the edges of your brownies all nice and straight rather than crumpling the parchment\npaper into the pan. In a large mixing bowl,\ncrack three room temperature eggs and add three quarters\ncup of coconut sugar. You could also use a low\ncarb granulated sugar of your choice like monk fruit if that's your preference. To that we'll add a\nquarter cup of cacao powder and one third cup of tapioca flour. Because I want fudgey brownies\nand not cakey brownies, I'm using only tapioca\nflour this time around and not adding almond\nflour or coconut flour. The secret ingredient\nin this recipe though which you've seen me add before\nin my paleo chocolate cake is espresso powder as it really adds richness to the chocolate. Lastly we'll add a half a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla extract and then blend it all together. You do wanna start your hand\nmixer on the lowest setting so that you don't accidentally\nblast tapioca flour all over your kitchen. You could also use a whisk and blend this together by hand. After all of those\ningredients are combined, add your melted chocolate which should be at room temperature and then mix them together on medium speed for another minute or until your mixture has thickened up to the\nconsistency of cake batter. Run a spatula around your bowl and then pour the brownie\nbatter into your cake pan. Use your spatula to push the batter into all the corners and make sure it's fairly flat, then pop your brownies in the\noven for 25 to 28 minutes. You really don't wanna\novercook these brownies, so if they seem a little\nsoft to you in the middle when you take them out, that's okay. While the brownies are cooking, I'm gonna whip up a really\nquick strawberry sauce and if you've watched\nmy chia seed jam recipe, this should look familiar. It's actually the same\nprocess of quartering then cooking the strawberries. Though I'm not adding chia\nseeds this time around. You could also substitute the strawberries with raspberries,\nblueberries or blackberries. So feel free to get creative. Heat a pot on medium heat and then add the strawberries to the pot. To the strawberries, we'll add one teaspoon of lemon juice and one to two tablespoons of maple syrup depending on how sweet\nyou would like your sauce. Stir this together and\nin a couple of minutes, your strawberries should\nstart to break down. After about five minutes, your strawberries will be really soft and then I take a potato masher to them to break down any larger pieces. Remove your brownies from\nthe oven and let them cool for five minutes in the pan. I know this smell will have you wanting to cut into them right away, but do let them sit for\na couple of minutes, then just pull the parchment paper out of the pan super easy and slice them up. The brownies will be warm and\nfudgey and let's be honest, I usually pop one in my mouth right away. If you're serving these\npaleo brownies on their own, I also love to add a little\nsprinkle of flake sea salt. Sea salt enhances the flavor of chocolate and it's an amazingly\ndelicious and simple combo. But if you wanna get fancy, let's kick these brownies up a notch. Just add a scoop of\nyour favorite ice cream and while I do have several\nvegan ice cream recipes on my website, I'm going with\na store bought version today. Then drizzle a few generous spoonfuls of your strawberry sauce and\nbecause mine is still warm, it's melting the ice\ncream into a gooey mess that I am perfectly happy with. I hope you guys enjoyed\ntoday's paleo brownies recipe and if you did, make sure\nto give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button below so you don't miss my next video. (optimistic music)", "mYsXCe62Rxc": "hey guys what's up I'm Nicole and I'm flying solo today so we're gonna try out Quito candy and regular candy which is better let's find out [Music] we've done a few videos now about Kido candy at least one we did about keto almond butter cups and Reese's peanut butter cups which means some Reese's peanut butter cups they're so good I don't care if you do have 10 grams of fat I still love your Reese's today we're gonna stick with the chocolate theme and we are doing something from a company called choc EXO or choc love I I don't know these these brands and their names I just can we just send it back to the drawing board and give this one a little a little bit more time these are keto snaps dark chocolate coconut and almonds plus sea salt I love all of those things so I have pretty high hopes for this stuff I think it's maybe gonna be good we'll find out soon it says on the back that a serving size is two pieces there's a hundred and eighty calories in two pieces which depending on how big the pieces that may not be that bad we'll see there are 15 grams of fat which seems kind of high only 4 grams of total sugar three of which are added sugars and 6 grams of carbohydrates main ingredient is organic chocolate so I guess that's kind of healthy still not on the whole keto fad diet thing I just I don't get it I would rather just go run 2 miles in some like 90 degree heat then make drastic changes to my diet or anything that I consume anyway this is the keto snaps dark chocolate coconut and almonds plus sea salt and we will be comparing that to a wonderful Ghirardelli intense dark sea salt soiree fancy words soiree it doesn't even look like it would sound SOI so so Irie it's a so I rebar so this is dark chocolate with sea salt and roasted almonds the only thing it's missing is the coconut but hopefully doesn't matter but serving size of this is also two pieces and there are 130 calories so there are fewer fewer calories in this than there are in these same amout so far quito losing there's only 8 grams of fat less fat but I think part of the Quito thing is like it's a high-fat diet so yes that's why it's so much more 14 grams of carbohydrates that's not great 10 grams of sugar all of which are added sugars well it has slightly fewer calories everything else seems not so healthy but it is from bean-to-bar so that will at least make you feel good about your candy I think let's stare into it per usual all individually wrapped whether that is a means to keep you from eating the whole bag or to just maybe help with your portion control and limiting I don't know I feel like a decent size now is one package a serving size or is it two packages we don't know it says it says serving size to pieces but I can feel this and it feels like we're pieces which is just bizarre let me show you what I'm talking about here this guy it's clearly four little squares now is a serving size square up top square down low or is a serving size one whole piece we will never know nor do I really care I'm just here to let you know if it tastes good or if it tastes like garbage okay well we're gonna go we're just gonna go with two so we'll count that as my serving size there's a whole lot of dark chocolate working there and I can definitely taste the coconut flavor I'm not getting a lot of salty a little bit of crunchy from the almonds but if you can look at that those almonds they're very chopped up diced pulverized really and same goes for the coconut like I can kind of see that there are our little white flakes of what I hope is coconut overall not bad I'm still just very confused on the serving amount I would hope that they're saying a serving size is two of these but the fact that it doesn't stay on the actual package if this is one serving or if this is two servings it's very confusing so choc XO or choc hugs and kisses whatever your brand name is please be more specific that is confusing as all get-out but flavor-wise not bad got some coconut stuck in my teeth not a big fan of that moving on let's skip to the let's get to the so I rebar okay okay I see you Ghirardelli want me to take my time you want me to pace myself got a work for your chocolate because I found a golden ticket look at that straight out of San Fran Cisco as president didn't come paired with a box of rice-a-roni am i right the real San Francisco treat boy they want you to take your time such a delicate foil and are so slightly crack into this I really want you to think about all your life choices that you're making here okay okay won't that rip to now serving size to pieces uh-huh this is all connected so this looks like a one-piece to me I know what you're thinking no Nicole that's not one-piece the Internet thanks a lot but hey if you also think that this counts as one piece just go ahead and tell me in the comments so I know that I'm not alone in thinking that this one giant candy bar could somehow count as one piece just just give me that much okay now so Ghirardelli I love them they're just they're so great they're so great I have driven by Ghirardelli Square in good old San Fran I've seen it zipped right by it I I had better things to do I didn't stop and across the Golden Gate Bridge anyway Ghirardelli they they make those little little tiny squares that you're a deli squares that we all love tons of flavors now this this is this is multiple squares lots of squares and they want you to do the work yourself break it apart they said it'll be easy they said okay well I tried to get one Ghirardelli was like nah bish serving sizes - you gonna get - this is too much candy to eat I would tell you what time it is right now but you don't really need to know just know that it is late and I am only gonna eat one it looks similar not in thickness but color and like filling yeah they both passes dark chocolate now obviously they are a little different one is like very dark one is just like a darker milk chocolate good enough it'll pass as dark chocolate I don't know if it says what the percentage of dark chocolate is my nose isn't high enough up in the air to really care right now what the percentage of dark chocolate is it's just intense dark that's all that matters it's dark chocolate that's what they said serving sizes two of these son of guns so the chocolate is good I had no doubts again I don't get a lot of salt but I do taste all the almonds feels like there's a lot more almonds in this maybe it's because there's less chocolate these other little keto ones they're pretty thick maybe they could add more almonds or just thin out their chocolate I don't know even on the back side there you can see all the little bumpy's those are the almonds I'm not sure where the grains of salt are it doesn't say how evenly spaced the almonds and the salt pieces are supposed to be it's just it's a so I rebar so you know it's fancy it says experience intense complex and perfectly dark chocolate roasted almonds and sea salt an irresistible combination of salty and sweet they're both good I don't have any complaints about these other than the fact that I have no I one of serving sizes of that I don't know if I should eat two full things or if it's two little squares but if this video is helpful at all in any way shape or form for you go ahead and like the video share it with your closest friends your neighbor down the street maybe subscribe to our channel if you're like yeah that was helpful thumbs up subscribe I'm really just here to eat all the candy and tell you about it that's Kido dark chocolate with coconut and almonds and maybe some salt I didn't find it and that's Ghirardelli so I read dark chocolate almonds and again missing salt salt it's just like the commercial from way back in the day where's the beef well where's the salt until next time bye", "GWOz_2Hmifo": "[Music] hi guys it's Heather from Heather Cristo calm and we are gonna make some incredible almond coconut Chocolate Chunk cookies today I'm also gonna be talking about where I sourced some of my difficult to find allergen free foods you guys asked all the time the truth is in the past I will spend hours running all over town of multiple grocery stores or online ordering things one from here another from the other place to find some of these really special ingredients that I rely on to make delicious food but lately I've solved all of that with thrive market it's a one-stop shop I've found that I can go in and really find some of these staple items that we are using all the time and they're less expensive and I can do everything in one place so over the next couple of weeks I'm gonna be showing you products that I love and can find they're on the cheap on insta stories I also have a 25% off coupon for you guys so if you want to go and try it yourself you get quite the discount but now we're gonna get into these cookies which are a recent favorite of my children of everybody I work with I think you're gonna love them too okay first we're gonna start with some cold coconut oil and it's important it's colder at room temperature because if it's liquid it's gonna be a really different texture of cookie and I'm using that in place of butter I like the flavor and it's just a nice substitute this is almond butter so we're gonna have that really rich creamy almond flavor I'm going all brown sugar just so it has that wonderful caramel flavor and then we're gonna turn this on and cream it [Music] because these cookies are vegan we're not adding eggs so it's not gonna get that fluffy texture that traditional cookies would but it is really well combined now we're gonna add the gluten-free all-purpose baking flour and this is that Bob's Red Mill brand that I use all the time and that I got it dry I've also got kosher salt and a little bit of baking soda that's gonna go in I like to stop and scrape this down once but it will be pretty dry as far as cookie dough goes and then we're gonna add a little coconut milk to get everything well combined okay here's the good part we're adding in unsweetened shredded coconut slivered toasted almonds and allergen-free chocolate chips pop that in there and you're gonna get a thick cookie dough I almost forgot the vanilla you just want a couple teaspoons okay now we're gonna get these scooped out on to prepared baking sheets and I like to use this cell pad but you could also use parchment paper so I'm using a medium scooper because these do spread some I'm just gonna make little balls and put them on here so now we have kind of fun parts one I'm gonna sprinkle every one of these with some more unsweetened shredded coconut and now I've got this is a dark chocolate vegan chocolate bar and it's actually sweetened with stevia still really good if you're wondering and I like to just break it into the chunks like go along the lines well attempt to oh wow and then push these little pieces right into the cookie I'm not always that good at it but you know chocolate is chocolate right and finally a little sprinkle of salt I'm just using kosher salt if you're fancy you can use sea salt but kosher salt works really well and I love this little added pinch it really brings out the chocolate flavor okay the ovens been preheating it's 350 degrees I'm going to put these in there for about 12 minutes so these have been cooking 12 13 minutes they're nice and golden-brown it smell really good we're just gonna let them cool for a minute and then pop them on the tray so here you go coconut almond Chocolate Chunk cookies they are so incredibly delicious the chocolates all melty the little crispy coconut in almonds super delicious head on over to Heather Chris TOCOM for the recipe [Music]", "i9HUtSOH524": "hi everyone in today's video i'm going to show you how to make almond energy bites the first ingredient is almonds add the almonds into a food processor and process them until they are coarsely ground [Music] the next ingredients are metro dates cocoa or cacao powder coconut oil and a pinch of sea salt now i mentioned this in my last video but in case you don't know i have another youtube channel with cooking videos the new videos have the names of the ingredients i am using displayed on the screen there are more cooking sounds and no taste tests i will still be posting videos on this channel but because the videos on the other channel have no taste tests i will be able to put out more content over there including recipes and tutorials i won't be posting here if you're already subscribed or are considering it thank you so much i will leave a link to the new youtube channel in the description box below this video now back to the recipe process all the ingredients until well combined the mixture will be tender and slightly crumbly at first but it should be sticky enough to hold together when you press it between your fingers if the mixture is too dry pause it a little bit more or add a little bit more coconut oil to help bind everything together [Music] so finally shape the mixture into balls i wish i processed this a little bit more to make it stickier but it will still work [Music] and that's it quick and easy almond energy bites so i'm sure you're familiar with energy balls because you can buy them in the store you can easily make them at home you can make different variations so you can use different dried fruit different nuts seeds coconut here we have almond date energy balls which are one of my favorite how do you like them there's three ingredients in here there are almonds dates cocoa there's a little bit of coconut oil so four technically four you can make larabars at home that is what i want to tell you right now if you enjoy larabars cliff bars i'm getting like uh almond fudge kind of vibe from this so it's got a very malleable texture chewy it feels very like sustaining like there's a lot of energy here like you can tell the oil and what like the density of it but very pleasant to eat it chews just like a larabar just like a clif bar like if you want to save some money i'm pretty sure you can make like a mass batch of this and it's a look at all the plates i know this actually because i buy those bars at the store and i'm amazed at how they're like two dollars yeah like it's like a dollar ninety six in canadian so you could probably save a bunch of money if nothing else they taste great you're gonna save money that's where i'm coming from make them all right so i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give me thumbs up comment below subscribe to my channel and i'll see you next time", "pzOWl_XVGt4": "today you have a you're not going to be trying five a motor off candy bars for you these are made in Germany however they were sent to us from Scotland I have the Madagascan vanilla the seesaw the caramel that orange in Holland and Chile we're also sensing milk chocolate that we've already tried that one previously so first we're going to try the Madagascan vanilla and this these are really cool packages because they have a five individually wrapped bar just like this in the package so it's not like those huge candy bars where you open it up and once itself is you put it in a ziplock baggies for your home now this is no a like that and this is 148 calories for this bar and I also like being able to tell the calories the next difference they make that makes sense because that's about the size of a hat or underside of the horses okay it is broken all the pieces so but it looks like this no more of white chocolate break the empathy Fidelma is a white chocolate vanilla bean blender his finest Madagascar vanilla chocolate Formosa roses and delicious treat for connoisseurs of sophisticated gourmet chocolate this chocolate is made with the finest quality ingredients carefully prepared according to a classic recipe the delicate flavor of Madagascar bourbon vanilla combines perfectly with smooth white chocolate to create an unforgettable eating experience and there are five individually red bars of white chocolate with Madagascar mellow that's right halogens very good food tastes like vanilla bean sir go oh it's true vanilla bean so it's not it doesn't taste like white chocolate it takes like a vanilla bean candy bar it's a delicious I mean is that's a little white chocolate or a little bit well no one bump it off yeah yeah I don't want anyone I wouldn't want anybody give this and think you're gonna get like chocolate because I've no absolute I really think you're going to get vanilla bit yeah it's very strong yeah very good though it's very smooth very creamy and I like the calories and 48 calories right so that's a low calorie treat for you in the middle of the day so if you buy one of these candy bars okay this is the sea salt it is 130 calories so less than the Madagascan vanilla and it is dark chocolate finest dark chocolate sea salt it has the delicate flavor of cocoa combines perfectly with a hint of sea salt to create an unforgettable taste sensation you're hot are you ready we also get to break the bars being dark very dry and crumbly compared to the white Devin said it's pretty good and I thought what salt would you be able to salt oh yeah but it's not it's not super super bitter or something it's a little bitter but not bad it's about as bitter as the Hershey's special dark yeah you know it's a lot of you look yeah they all even less but yeah it's a very very good job normally we wouldn't and eat your chocolate but Ali does yeah personally felony but it's good I'm going to choose it like a wall of these nuts are all ours I wouldn't choose that our own just because I'm no doctor on MRSA but if you liked our chocolate you would certainly like this oh yeah I'm clearing game doctor I never got a call to the why I took but I got solved that it was at the end and I got like it was like two crystals of salt but it was just enough to have beautiful yes very salty this one is the caramel 136 calories and it has a smooth milk chocolate and a crunchy texture of small pieces of caramel so we're going to get a crunchy texture crunchy coral pieces boo me like it , you know broken up I'll talk about it's good that's delicious I love the milk chocolate flavor I think the very good milk chocolate in the caramel it's a very sweet super-sweet very very sweet caramel so and some caramels are more bitter this illiterate form well like a bar part almost what I meant this one's very very sweet good welcome very urban support mmm yeah well yeah I'm not I think I think so this one is the orange and almond it is orange flavored dark chocolate with almonds pieces now I'll tell you and if you've watched this long enough you know we prefer orange in milk chocolate but we'll see orange and dark chocolate I know that's supposed to be the classic with almond pieces giving one throw away this is a hundred and thirty-four calories mmm-hmm you get the orange then I love that one mm-hmm now I'll get almonds honey did you know almonds are there I got it from the texture I got a little piece of almond it was like a a sliver of on them I like that I like that added texture but you really didn't take the owner with the orange and I like that since the dark chocolate isn't that bitter bitter dark chocolate then it got everyone nice work and milk chocolate but but I like this one because it's not overpowering like some of those are like there's the chocolate orange to me that dark chocolate is too too dark so when we buy one we buy the milk chocolate orange and it's delicious fruit but now this this isn't it too bitter at all I like that on Austria if you like one okay that's what I want you all the time the last one is Chile it is a Hara 34 calories chili flavor dark chocolate it says make amazing it just says the same exact same thing spicy chili that's Ralph Lauren spicy chili remember Julia I'm likely to the slice all I felt was chocolate going oh you get it at the end but it's very very telling you must be really know it it's heat you get heat no it's not it's not strong at all I think it's like literally I know it shows a red pepper on here oh but to me it was almost like a black yeah there's just a little bit of heat once you swallow it that is a very very pleasant candy bar I like that it's good it's not super bitter dark pushes oh yeah so let's put them in order good whoa no way yeah I like Roma one is an L in a second and a chilli third if I have caramel and then vanilla and then chilli if I had to pick apart chilli if you had to think of that means you really like these two the best another one I wrote a popular so I'll say those were my two favorites as well but honestly I really like them all I do and I didn't expect to like them all because they are in dark chocolate but I do I think they're very good candy bars they'll be good to keep in our drawer because they are individually wrapped and they are low calorie so this is something and then I could have at night for a sweet tonight or I could grab in the middle of the day I like I do because I eat like a hobbit I can grab it in all the days for a low-calorie side so thank you very very much for centimeter and I will have a picture for you at the end although there they came all the way from Scotland so I'm sure they don't look like school if you bought these in your local store I'm sure they don't look the same as what you would get if you bought them in there but I'll post the picture anyway and thanks for watching [Music]", "sA1Fc9XHs7o": "(upbeat gentle music) - Thank you so much for watching.

that a lot of you know this a graters is an ice cream it's a brand of ice cream and we actually did a couple of videos where we went in there and we tried the ice cream truck ice cream at home so Kevin I've seen those videos you might want to watch those but while we were in there loving toward their little shop they had these candy bars in there and I think there were like five a total that dark chocolate and something else but they were $2.99 each so I just bought three because I figured nine dollars is a lot of money for candy bars this one is just the regular milk chocolate bar this is milk chocolate with crispy rice and this is the milk chocolate with almonds we're gonna try the regular milk chocolate first and it says handcrafting irresistible ice cream since 1870 one-third of the bar is under 80 calories per pill slot out nope must be okay never know how they rappers are like and this is a manufactured for brighter so no time to actually oh okay so yeah it doesn't even have graders or written on the bar it's just just has a design on the front and then the back is just plain but for some summer rates do you think I did that's guitar either he remind you the world's famous talking about world's finest holds bonds that is going to give us an all they feel to it it does but it's really it's very good sex was very creepy you don't realize how good it is until you really get it all over your tongue and to me it's really very very good that would be good if you could melt it somehow and dip like pretzels hey this one's with the Rice Krispies basic on the top what's the same at the bottom the bottom is where it looks different that's good mm-hmm Dig Dug the exact same chocolate it has yeah it just has that crisped rice in up it is I think better than a Nestle Crunch Bars yes the the chocolate is just it's better quality than your age brunch and I love the pieces of the Chris Bryce good question normally that's not a candy bar I gravitate towards but now that's that's very very essence also a little thicker that it is and this one's with some chocolate on it when I'm back when I was a kid and I was I've Hershey Gaynor I don't even got her skin tumors anymore but when I was a kid and aged about Hershey candy bars I would buy the ones of all those now there's just too many other pending bars that are really good that thought about her she bloody gory good you lost your honor it has a strong almond flavor that's good like almonds oh it is good yes honestly shockingly I would even though it's good I would not get that one again because the almond is so strong going to enjoy the chocolate mm-hmm the chocolate on its own is such a good flavor that you you that just takes over you know and you don't you don't need that much on well I like both of these I think I probably just buy the regular milk chocolate sake however Romanus that was 180 for a third and the almonds is 195 this was the crispy is the cereals one set about the same yeah out of all of them I think I would choose the milk chocolate them too just because it has a really good flavor you can let it melt on your tongue and this would last you well so how far all I'm impressed with all three of those Roy don't know very very good yeah I don't you know you ain't paying - nothing on for a candy bar but if you divvy it out and it lasts you for three servings then it was worth your three dollars so I hope you enjoyed the video I will have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "sQbs0M1TnRs": "today we are making a homemade candy that's a lot like amounts or an almond joint bar we like these because we can use common ingredients and make our own candy bar all you need is unsweetened coconut honey coconut oil salt and chocolate you can also use sweetened coconut but we're going to sweeten our coconut on our own we'll start with our coconut layer place all your ingredients except for the chocolate inside of the blender one quarter cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of honey two cups of coconut and one quarter teaspoon of salt blend me up it's gotten a little bit pasty its pasty enough that we can press it down in our pan but let's taste it first it's to eat enough it's gonna have sweet chocolate with it or your mixture into your pan mix it around with your fingers and Pat it into a layer and he's doing it place it in the freezer while you're melting your chocolate we melted our chocolate in a double boiler with the help of our mom and now we're going to pour it over the coconut we're using about a half a cup of chocolate anything thickness until the pot was out of chocolate we made the mistake of melting a lot of extra chocolate chocolate we're gonna place this in the freezer for about three hours now it's time for the taste test the coconut layer adds a good texture to the chocolate the chocolate is smooth but the coconut is crunchy Exedy is all day this is a lot better than eating the ones from the store that's it well as you watch her outtakes be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel even the honey sticks to everything everything flat lick name one thing that honey doesn't stick to it sticks it's because you eat it too fast to see if it'll stick we eat this candy in two layers and we're going to start with the coconut layers candy in two nails", "0IMTdGEpdtA": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some kind of fins these were sent to us from sarah in california thank you very very much to sarah uh this is the caramel almond and sea salt and then i have the dark chocolate both of these are this one's peanut butter and this one is nuts and seeds so the good thing about these is that they if you're wanting like um something with a lot of flavor but with fewer calories then uh you would go to these and i i we haven't tried them of course but that's the i'm guessing that's why they made them because this is only 100 calories the peanut butter is only 100 calories and then the nuts and the nuts and sea salt is only 90 calories sea salt sea salt yeah what did you say i said nuts and seeds oh no nuts and seeds right it has seeds okay uh this one is caramel almond and sea salt no they weren't as crunchy as i thought they were gonna be a little more sticky actually not your typical kind bar no but that is a little bit uh it's chewy it's a little bit um it's a little chewy i like that though honestly i taste peanut i do too a lot of peanuts yeah so i know it's supposed to be caramel almond that's really good combo or almond no i swear it tastes like peanut yeah if you hadn't if i was blindfolded i would have guessed that was a peanut butter yeah 100 but i do like it i think it's delicious it's very good and a little chewy because sometimes kind bars are they're they're sticky more than chewy they're like sticking your teeth yes and they can be hard and brittle yeah so this is the peanut butter dark chocolate it is 100 calories yeah we bit into that when i was expecting it to go you know break and it didn't right so it has a drizzle on the top of dark chocolate and it has a coating like they dipped it on the bottom yeah this one had a coating as well they're gluten free now i don't get um there's a a bit of a bitterness to that one let's fix that yes and i don't get any peanut butter at all no the dark chocolate is all you taste yes a little bit chewy but it's not as chewy i don't think it's the first one right i like the texture i just don't really get the peanut butter no i would if you're looking for peanut butter i would skip that because you don't taste any peanut butter that dark chocolate takes over everything it does even the grains and the seeds and all that kind of stuff they put in there it kind of just takes all that flavor away this is the dark chocolate um well that one's already broken for us dark chocolate nuts and sea salt and it's 90 calories really sticky um once again the dark chocolate um and i'll be very honest with you i really don't care for that dark chocolate um no i get a little bit more flavor out of that beyond dark chocolate just a little bit but it's still primarily dark chocolate and i can't compare these to other kind bar reviews we've done with dark chocolate because i would have to have them side by side because i may have liked them in those other bars but i think it's exactly so i think it's a different experience when you have them with the thin bars because there's uh less like what you're saying there's less of other things right to help overrides on the darts yeah if they had either just done the drizzle and left the bottom coating off it probably would have balanced better but since they did both it's dark chocolate overkill yeah you're better off getting a dark chocolate little bar yeah it's just too much dark chocolate and i would not get those down yeah and it's like you said it's a little bitter so yeah the only one that i really really like out of these is the caramel almond and sea salt and it tastes like a peanut bar it really does taste like a vegan bar but it looks like a peanut butter yeah but it is very very good uh if you like dark chocolate you could try the other ones but i think most people that buy this if you buy this you're probably expecting to taste peanut butter you're not going to taste the peanut butter because it is so thin no but if you like dark chocolate and you like that kind bar texture then and you want to save a few calories then try them out try them out yeah so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "8vMn-wKmObc": "everybody Kevin Moses here going to do a nutritionist review today and another health bar the kind bar right here is what we're going to look at today I'm not going to eat in front of you because I've already had one of these but I just want to give you my feedback it's the maple glazed pecan and sea salt if you've had any these new buyers out there that has seesaw it's such a good combination get that sweet get that salty flavor tastes pretty good right I like kind bars my favorite is the almond coconut a lot of good healthy fats with that coconut gives me keeps me satisfied for a long period of time so I like that in a bar right this one is the same in terms of I mean not a coconut but it definitely is a lot of fat right so it's got 17 grams of fat probably from all the other nuts the mixed nuts because some of the nuts in here our pecan almonds and in regular peanuts okay the other ingredients carbs 13 grams only five of those are sugar and five grams of protein so you can tell it really is a good healthy bar and if you want to consume those you go to your local grocery store you can find kind buyers everywhere and check it out okay got any questions let me know take care bye bye", "ubmxXMZf6p4": "hello my small fat adaptive family and welcome back to keto bits and bobs here on keto bits and bobs i review products or brands that are found more specifically in the united kingdom as a brit who has been in ketosis for over six years today we are looking at keto collective bars keto collective sent me some bars in return for a fair and honest review and they're a pretty new company on the market and i always look forward to trying new things so thank you keto collective these bars as of recording this video come in the flavors chocolate sea salt coconut and salted caramel they are 40 gram bars and a box of 15 will cost you 20 pounds 99 meaning each bar works out to about 1 pound 30. and you have the option to buy either 15 of one flavor or a mixed box of 15. both of which are available on the keto collective website i have linked it down below in the description if you want to check it out now this is a usual sort of price for keto bars in this country it's just a little bit frustrating that you can't buy a one-off or a pack of just the three flavors on their own just so that you can try them without spending a fair bit of money on a box of them but let's talk about ingredients in terms of ingredients these salted caramel bars have peanuts sunflower seeds chicory root fiber which is also known as inulin which is a sweetener almonds coconut oil coconut milk powder molasses and sea salt the chocolate sea salt bars have peanuts sunflower seeds chicory root fiber inulin cacao coconut oil dried coconut milk and sea salt and the coconut bars have coconut sunflower seeds chicory root fiber cashew nuts coconut milk powder and coconut oil the great thing about all of these bars is that they use a minimal amount of ingredients the chicory root fiber the inulin the sweetener that is being used has a glycemic index of one meaning that it shouldn't raise your blood sugars or affect your journey on keto the only other ingredient that might cause some worry for you or alarm is that there's molasses in the salted caramel bars i really wouldn't worry about this too much unless you are really strict clean keto because yes molasses is usually high carb but it's being used in such a minimal quantity and we know this because it hasn't affected the carbs horrendously and it's low on the ingredients list now macronutrients wise depending on which flavor you get it will vary between 209 to 220 calories 16.4 to 18.2 grams of fat 4.5 to 7.2 grams of protein and 2.8 or 3.9 net carbs these are decent macros i don't really have much to say about them though i will say for those of you that strive to have really high fat and keto the coconut bars whilst being the highest carb have the lowest protein and the highest fat so now let's talk about the taste and the texture of keto collectives bars textually i found them to be quite oaty feeling to me they sort of tasted like more of a biscuity flapjack it's quite interesting really i've tried a lot of different keto bars and i find that keto collective bars texturally sit literally in the middle between fat bars and keto keto bars so they have this sort of slight dense nurse with a chewy feeling but then they have this sort of oaty crumbly feeling at the same time i honestly just love having all of these different textures available to us in all these different bars i also found all of the bars to not be massively sweet i don't have a very big sweet tooth and i loved how sweet they were but i know that there's a lot of you that watch this channel that have a real strong sweet tooth so these might be a bit too mild in sweetness for you let me talk about the bars individually so the coconut bars they had this sort of very milky coconut taste to them that was really nice and lingered in my mouth afterwards the only texture difference that they had from the other bars was that i found them to be a little bit more gritty but that was sort of your typical shredded coconut grit the chocolate sea salt bars were very intriguing whilst the bar itself i didn't find very overpowering and chocolate flavor and i found the aftertaste to be more chocolaty the bars for me had this very date taste to them that sort of raisiny black trickly flavor that you get with date heavy snacks and i actually really think that this sort of date taste added to it because not only do we not really get things like that on keto this sort of raisiny black trickly taste combined really well with the subtle chocolate and lastly we'll talk about my favorite which was the salted caramel bars these bars were actually quite subtle in flavor they weren't heavily caramel tasting and the saltiness combined with the subtle sweetener was a really beautiful balanced combination but i am a little bit biased because i do love the flavor of salted caramel i also found them to have sort of a peanut buttery aftertaste which you know i'm not complaining about i love peanut butter all in all the keto collective bars are really good i honestly don't have very many negatives the macros are good they use decent ingredients that for the most part fit any type of keto journey they have a few different flavors for different taste palettes they're in the average sort of price range for ketogenic bars and most importantly is that these bars taste good and they have a nice texture i honestly think that the only cons for these bars is that you have to bulk by them so you can't just trial them and they may not be sweet enough for you if you have a heavily sweet tooth thank you again keto collective for sending me some bars to review but with that being said that is all for this video leave a like if you found it interesting insightful or

here to show you how to make scrumptious cookie bars using chocolate walnuts and coconut they're going to be great making cookie bars really is easy and you won't believe how amazing these tastes so let's get started what we're going to do is we're going to take a stick of melted butter and we're just going to pour that right into our 9 by 13 baking dish like this and we're just going to let that kind of go all over the bottom and then we're going to take crushed graham crackers and all I did was I took about eight eight or nine graham crackers in a plastic bag and I just crushed them until their fine powder and this is really easy all you're going to do is just sprinkle this in the bottom of the cake pan until you cover all of that butter and what this is going to do is it's actually going to be the foundation of our cookie bar so this is going to be the crust this is a super super easy recipe and everyone in your family is going to love these okay so once you've got the graham crackers on then it's time to start with your walnuts now I like walnuts but you could use pecans or really any kind of nut that you like and all you're going to do is just sprinkle these over the crust evenly like this and next we go on with chocolate and I like to use a whole bag of chocolate chips and I use semi-sweet chocolate chips but if you like a little bit sweeter cookie bar you could always use milk chocolate chips and the chocolate is going to also kind of hold those nuts in place and once you get the chocolate on then it's time to go on with coconut and again we're just going to sprinkle the coconut all over the cookie bar and when you put this in the oven to bake it's going to get nice and golden brown it's going to be delicious okay once your coconut is on in an even layer then you're just going to go on with sweetened condensed milk and what I like to do is I like to just drizzle it and I'll start around the edge because we want the edges of the cookie bars to kind of all hold together this is going to make it all hold together nicely and then I just go back and forth in a zigzag pattern like this until I get the whole surface covered with sweetened condensed milk so once you've covered the top with the sweetened condensed milk it's time to go into the oven so 350 degrees for 18 to 22 minutes until the coconut is nice and brown and you're going to have delicious cookie bars and again I'm Laurie fangio with around the table and today I showed you how to make scrumptious cookie bars I hope you enjoy them see you next time", "WX22zfL4rgo": "hey guys III Skye here and today I have another recipe for you guys another easy simple stress-free recipe that will remind you of a childhood favorite candy bar I'm talking about I'll enjoy or mount bars you

piece of healthy enjoy bars and she is a fan of these can be born and I wanted to treat her but in a healthier way so let's get started with our recipe in a bowl we place our shredded unsweetened coconut then we add our coconut butter or any nut butter that has a mild flavor then we add our date paste and maple syrup we mix until our mixture is sticky you can add a bit more of maple syrup or a little bit more update paste until you can form little balls with your dough and place them in a baking sheet covered with parchment paper [Music] then we place one almond on top of each little ball and finally we cover our coconut almond balls with a mixture of melted dark chocolate and coconut oil and we place in the freezer until set and they are ready to eat what did you think of the recipe

gonna be trying four different items from Stewart's shops these were sent to us from no it's just hot and these were sent to us from Laura in New York so thank you so much Laura we do not have Stewart shops anywhere near us I actually said they're all over New York though yes I looked it up it said that Stewart shops have been in business for more than 70 years there are 335 Stewart shops located in 31 counties across upstate New York and southern Vermont so that's it lost or isn't small no no but they are nowhere else in the United States so southern Vermont and New York so we have the Stewart's chocolate-chip cookies we have three candy bars a milk chocolate sea salt caramel dark chocolate raspberry and dark chocolate peppermint and the government of the limited-edition the chocolate chip cookies it looks like it was 99 cents for the box and we took two out and hated them just now they are little cookies which I like but we wanted to try more only did it's like two things Wow so these soft um it was softer than no it's well they're soft but I mean it's much softer when you painted them yeah I can burn em I hate it oh really well she didn't tell me no no no they taste really good but they don't have that like fresh-baked cookie flavor necessarily eat him up but they're just as good not you I think I like them better I needed to know yeah and they're really good it says three cookies or 140 calories no so that's not bad at all and that that is a very good job enjoy them and like I said I think she only paid 99 cents and you get a box full cookies full of little men cookies I'll take a picture for you and just know that we've taken three out of the box yeah but those are going to either they're good either way I like them just as good it's not better not here on your outer box well there was one price tag on the candy bars and it says a dollar 29 so I'm assuming they were all the dollar 29 age the milk chocolate with sea salt caramel is 270 calories I found it interesting that this is you know it's a pretty small business because they're only luck even though they have 335 stores you know when you start talking about Speedway and places at 7-eleven this is small compared to those so it surprises me that such a small shop has their own love of candy bars into that and it just looks like this just squares doesn't that surprise you this is like a convenience all right look at that yeah and a lot of them might have gas stations they don't they so guys - mmm your car mm-hmm there's a good running car walking mm-hmm I've got a little bit of a salty bubble it supposed to be sea salt mm-hmm that's very good very sweet the chocolate uh booth yeah that's a very very sweet caramel it is running stuff you don't like runny caramel Kevin usually does not eat runny runny or he doesn't choose that he usually goes for the fart now okay caramel I don't like those because they're just too runny there's a lot more of that these are a thin layer of dead jobs right and it's in pieces to where you can yeah so I don't mind this one because it's not like over you're not gonna mouthful runny chocolate I mean running right I like this one Julian that's really real and I like the chocolate the chocolate is actually really good job look now this one's dark chocolate with raspberry and it is 260 calories what was this one 274 the milk chocolate 264 the dark chocolate with raspberry little squares again and if you have the website it tells how many people they employ and everything really good raspberry floor [Music] and the dark Papa is a little bored but it's not like overpower my dark it's a it's a nice dog that tastes like one of the chocolates you get out of the fancy chocolate box when the with the raspberry on the entire yeah the raspberry is excellent I like that one better than the farm that I do this does it have more flavor maybe even one of the collar was good yeah a strong much better you does more yeah the raspberry it is just so much stronger it's amazing I wonder if it's all raspberry jam because that you could put that on toast and you know I didn't look to see what all they sell I don't even think about that um okay this says that it's a new bar it is dark chocolate with peppermint and it also says limited edition smoker and it's also 270 calories I mean it's dark chocolate this one saw mm-hmm the other ones were like filled and this is a solid bar just got a candy peaceful mmm-hmm how did you that's good the pepper mint it's there but it's not real astronomer pop I think it's really good nothing it's just enough peppermint bark oh man it's not like too strong that's a really good gay bar I love once again I like the dark chocolate I think it's a very good yard toilet it's not bitter no yeah it's it's would hit you off at all so for people like us that don't like we're really really dark chocolate this is the perfect amount yeah I think my favorite one though was Redbirds nothing it's not something I would want all the time you're not gonna want to rise barricading bar all the time but I do think out of the three of them is how we're to go in there and get gas or whatever I would would not pick enough oil right or the cookies the cookies are absolutely delicious so thank you so much Laura for sending us these I hope everyone else enjoyed getting to see a little bit of Stewart's because I know that you know they don't have very many of them so more than likely most people watching this have never even heard of them before like me so Laura thank you for introducing us all with something new and as always I'll have the picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] you", "iEhAHGk6DXM": "We hear it all the time in the media\n\"dark chocolate is healthy\", \"it is a superfood\", \"it has antioxidants\", but is\nthat true? I did a moderation rant video not too long ago where I kinda hated on\ndark chocolate and a lot of you guys hated on me for it. I could sense the\nconfusion and ever since the unhealthy versus healthy snacks video so many of\nyou have requested a dark chocolate video. So here it is. These videos do take\nthe most time to research and concept and design and develop and edit so I\nappreciate your patience as you've waited almost a month for this video. So before we talk\nabout the nutrition let's find out how is chocolate made. Chocolate comes from cocoa beans which come from\nthe pods of the fruit that grows on the cacao or coco tree. Once those beans are fermented\nand dried they can be used to create chocolate. The fermentation process is where some of\nthe flavor comes from but not all. So why do some bars taste different than others even though they're both called dark or semi-sweet?\nFlavor starts with the bean itself so were it's grown, how it's fermented makes a difference.\nOnce the dried beans are cracked into cocoa nibs and melted  down you get cocoa liquor\nwhich is the pure unrefined form of chocolate that contains both the solids, the chocolately part, and the cocoa butter which is a natural fat present in the bean. And now for a quick terminology breakdown! Cacao is made by cold pressing unroasted cocoa beans. Cocoa powder is essentially cocoa solids that remain after cocoa butter is extracted. A lot could be said about cocoa powder but pretty much if you're using an unsweetened version that does not contain added sugar you're good in the health\ndepartment. So there could be different amounts of cocoa solids and butter in a bar and that number which\nleads to a huge difference in taste is cocoa percentage. So let's talk about cocoa percentage. 100%\ncacao is unsweetened chocolate and the only ingredient is unsweetened chocolate. I\ndon't know if you've tasted this bar but it's disgusting. Most people cannot really enjoy a hunk\nof this it's more commonly used in baking or cooking. So 100% is at the top\nof the spectrum. As you go down the spectrum the cocoa percentage will\ndecrease and I'm going to show you how the sugar will increase along with the\namount of milk products. So a bar could have 25% solids and 45% cocoa butter and it would be a 70% bar or it could have 35% solids and\n35% cocoa butter and it would still be a 70% bar and that is one of\nthe reasons that some of the bars even if they're the same percentage are gonna\ntake a little bit different we don't know the recipes. So I went to the store\nand I spend a lot of time with chocolate and labels. Some of the brands will\ninclude the cacao percentage like these. However because these bars are flavored\ncaramel, almond, mint, whatever we want to make sure there aren't any variables when\nwe are comparing the macro nutrients so we're going to use plain\nchocolate for comparison sake. But I did want to show you that the cacao percentage is included sometimes on the design. To compare I\npicked up these bars. They are all the same brand of chocolate in different\npercentages. So the first thing we want to do is make sure that the serving\nsize is the same and all the products were comparing as we discussed in my\nunhealthy versus healthy snacks video. As you can see 2 of these are noting the\nserving size to be 1 section or 15 grams, 1 of them is 3 sections 38\ngrams, and 1 is 4 sections 45 grams. So that's probably because the 2 that\nare noting for 1 section are both baking bars and they don't really need\nto suggest a specific serving size. With chocolate bars or candy bars usually\nabout 40 grams is a serving so both of these have just decided to do 39 and 45.\nAmerica is stupid. I don't know why we do that. Everyone else in the world goes per\n100 grams why can't we just be the same? Doesn't really matter. The point is\nwe need these to all be the same so that we can compare accurately and we are going\nto use 40 grams to compare. So let's take a second to notice the trends. As the\ncocoa percentage increases the fat and saturated fat also relatively increase.\nThe carbs and sugar on the other hand decrease. So higher cocoa percentage equals\nmore fat and less sugar and this is the important correlation that we need to\ntake from this comparison. A lot of people think that milk chocolate must be\nhigher in fat because it's worse for you but that's actually not the case. There\nis so much naturally-occurring fat in cocoa butter that the more pure the\nchocolate the more fat there's gonna be and of course the less sugar. For fun let me also\nadd in a good old regular milk chocolate bar up there and it does stick with the\ntrend having less fat and more sugar per serving. So that brings us to\nwhere does milk chocolate fall on the spectrum? Generally, this is how it breaks down terminology wise. Unsweetened,  brute, or bitter chocolate it usually 99% or more but\nthe range is 85-100%. Bittersweet is the next range and that if 60-85% although the FDA only requires 35% from the cocoa bean for that label bittersweet to be slapped on it. Semisweet ranges from 35-60%. Milk only needs 10% pure chocolate and contains added cocoa butter and sugar which is why it is\nmost obviously a candy bar. There is very little true cocoa in this bar. White chocolate is based\non sugar, milk, and cocoa butter without the solids which is why it's white. It's 0% cocoa. It isn't even really chocolate. It's all sugar which is why it's the best. Comment below and let me know are you #TEAMWHITE, #TEAMMILK, or #TEAMDARK So what does this all mean? How do we apply it to daily life? And when is chocolate good for me? So does chocolate provide antioxidants? Yes and no. Cacao and cocoa beans are powerhouses\nfull of antioxidants. But how much of these are we getting in the chocolate that we\nbuy and what are the nutrients? Because you know eating this, or this, or this is not the same as eating cacao beans. So this is where those percentages become important.\nChocolate as a health food has become a little bit of a fad and the companies are trying to\ntake advantage of it. They want you to buy their product and if they can make\nit seem healthy even better. But the truth is we really need to be consuming at\nleast 70% dark. Some people even recommend 80% to absorb those\nbenefits. The dairy and sugar in the lighter chocolate, while delicious, does\nlower the antioxidant content also really upping the calories and of course\nthe sugar. Dark chocolate really dark chocolate does not inherently have sugar\nand that is important to remember is not a sweet food. The problem really is with\nthe word \"dark\". How dark does something have to be to be considered dark\nchocolate? Not that dark unfortunately. So back to these bars 41% is labeled as\nmilk chocolate and 55% is labeled as dark chocolate. So there doesn't seem to\nbe an official rule of where the line for milk and dark is but from my\nresearch about the 50% mark that's where companies start to kind of turn over to\ndark. Macro wise the difference between the 41, 55, and 80% is not really that\ndifferent and that's one point that I wanna make in this video. Macro wise chocolate is still very dense\nin calories and fat and it actually has even more fat the darker you get. Too many calories and fat from a healthy food can be just as damaging as too many calories and sugar\nfrom an unhealthy food. I do want to point out the difference between the 55%\ndark which is actually milk and the 80% dark. Macro wise calories are about\nthe same. Fat is again higher than the darker sugar is double in the lighter but also\nwhat can't be forgotten and this is I guess the point on the other hand is\nthat those antioxidants are not going to be as accessible in this lighter bar.\nHere's the next point I wanna make, dark chocolate, truly dark, will have more iron,\nmagnesium, phosphorus, other minerals than milk chocolate. But it is not really\nenough to justify using these items these dark chocolates as sources for\nthose minerals. If you look at the bars you'll see not all of the minerals\nare noted but iron is noted and you'll see that the iron levels get higher 30, 35, 40%\nthe darker we get. What you have to remember is that 40% although\nit may be the daily required or recommended amount that is for a full 37 grams, 9\npieces of this, to get 40% of your iron. So eating a full 37 grams or 9\npieces of this would be way more than a daily recommended amount. You know\nthat's a true indulgence. Most nutritionists would recommend one square\nper day so not 9. Plus do you know what else is high in magnesium and iron\nand phosphorus higher in fact? Pumpkin seeds But who wants to eat that\nwhen you can eat dark chocolate? This is my point. It's like red wine yes\nit may contain some antioxidants but the antioxidant thing is mostly an excuse\nfor when you want to eat or drink it. Ultimately if you want to eat a piece of chocolate go ahead and eat it. The darker you can go the better. The more access you'll have to those\nantioxidants. But it still needs to be an occasional and honest indulgence and dark\nchocolate cannot be a primary source for these antioxidants and minerals. I'm\nreally sorry if you're a dark chocolate fanatic. I am not telling you to not eat\nit. I am simply saying that some of us may need to re-evaluate the role that\ndark chocolate plays in our daily diets. And just for fun really quickly I wanna\ntalk about some candies because this is where it really becomes a problem. You\nknow the dark chocolate Doves and the dark chocolate Lindts and the dark chocolate Kisses that fool us. So Hershey's special dark has a seal, it says cocoa is a natural source of flavanol antioxidants and on the back it has a little blurb to talk about how healthy they are. But let's compare the macronutrients to milk chocolate kisses. Look they're pretty much the same. The same amount of\nfat and only 2 grams different and sugar and as you know the darker chocolate\nshould have more fat and less sugar it only has 2 grams. We know that no dark chocolate would really have 21 grams of sugar. That's added sugar. Well I looked it up because it does not\ntell you the cocoa percentage on this package. Hershey's Special Dark is only\n45% dark. 45. Do you remember do you remember the spectrum this 41% bar is\nlabeled as milk they classified as 45% chocolate as dark. Some antics. Now Hershey's extra dark is 60% I looked\nthat up but remember 60% is still not dark enough to really access those\nantioxidants. So this is where it becomes a problem with these candies that call\nthemselves dark but they really aren't. Same goes you know with the Dove eggs and the Lindts they're all the same. If they say dark on them you really have to read the package you\nwanna make sure you know the ingredients and you want to make sure that the sugar is low it\nshould be very low and the fat should be higher if it's true dark. So don't be\nafraid of chocolate or of any food but we do need to A) be honest about our\nconsumption of these foods and recognize when they're helping or hurting us so\neating chocolate to get in your potassium is not really realistic B)\neducate ourselves so that we are informed enough to make those decisions\nthat allow us to be honest.

mix to combine the Lapith and chill pastry completely that's very important they divided the sugar dough in two portions flour work surface and walk it out to soften but not too much you want to keep the dough cool and so ball if it cracks work it out a little bit more than a roll out into a three millimeter of thick disk if you get too soft don't hesitate to put it back in the fridge for a few minutes then cut out into discs save scraps chill discs and do likewise with a remaining pastry by the way you want to grease your pastry rings using softened butter so then the dough will stick place mystery discs in the center and gently press down into the sides of the ring making sure that there is no air pockets left behind shape of excess pastry do likewise with the remaining Pat Sucre and freeze line with two layers of microwave safe plastic wrap fill up with pie weights and refrigerate meanwhile I am going to make my coconut dacquoise but before you begin of an honor to 350 degrees

stiff peaks and fold your coconut tampoco in the meringue spread this beautiful coconut mixture on the baking tray line with a silicone baking mat or a greased parchment paper make a nice and thick coconut dacquoise sheet a right after I'm gonna bake my tart shell for 20 minutes with the pie weights and 5 minutes more without the last thing you want to put in your oven or the macadamia nuts indeed it's right after on the to-do list for the caramelized macadamia and by the time my sugars cooking more crucial nuts macadamia tree is native to Australia but also thrive in Hawaii Southern California and many others subtropical and tropical regions so when your syrup which is 244 degrees Fahrenheit 118 degrees Celsius throw in a nuts stirring constantly soon the sugar is going to crystallize around each nut continue stirring until complete communist a tion is should take 15 minutes cool and set aside next salted caramel cook sugar and conserve to brown caramel add butter heavy cream and salt cook to 216 degrees tonight 102 degrees Celsius cool and set aside next in the agenda we are going to make caramel again but this one a sec meaning without water so move the sugar around a hot frying pan and cook to pour le caramel deglaze with the heavy cream and transfer into a small saucepan much easier to manage then temper egg yolks and cook the caramel mixture on low heat to 185 degrees Fahrenheit 85 degrees Celsius just like a creme anglaise then I'm gonna add the gelatine and pass to receive over my melted chocolate so our caramel creme anglaise should be now at 105

serious Quito and when I made my macadamia coconut cashew butter which was mind-blowing ly awesome I got some comments from some people who were concerned about the cashews when it comes to nuts cashews are kind of on that carby end of things so I decided that I would make a macadamia coconut almond nut butter and try and shoot for that same sort of silky consistency in order to do that I start by blanching and skinning the almonds bring a pot of water to boil then add 4 ounces or 115 grams of almonds set a timer for 45 seconds we don't want to boil longer than a minute otherwise we run the risk of the almonds getting soft also have a colander in the sink so that we can strain these EB BB that's me doing the alarm sound after the sink to drain these then you can either rinse them under cold water or what I'm gonna do is just put them in a bowl with some ice water well let these soak for about 2 or 3 minutes then they're ready to peel you peel the almonds just by squeezing them sometimes the almonds will actually go flying don't worry about getting them perfect there's an example of one that goes flying whoa how about that put the blanched almonds on a rack on a paper towel so that they can dry I'm also saving the skins which I'm gonna put into the composter this is a fairly tedious job so if you've got kids this is a great task to farm out to them I don't know what I was saying there if you have coconut butter you can start by adding 4 ounces to your blender or you can take unsweetened shredded coconut again 4 ounces or 115 grams and we're gonna make our own coconut butter not quite as smooth as the stuff out of the jar hmm but tasty though and once we blended another cycle with the nuts I'm sure it'll smooth out I'm gonna scrape down the sides and the twister jar attachment then we'll add four ounces of macadamia nuts again 115 grams are blanched and peeled and now dry almonds again 4 ounces 115 grams 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and sweetener to taste I'm using a half a teaspoon of an erythritol stevia blend now 40 more seconds of noise and we're going to have ourselves some fantastic nut butter now the texture on this isn't quite as smooth as I'd like I think probably because I did the homemade coconut butter rather than the jar stuff so I'm going to run through another cycle just to see if I can't smooth this out a little bit more so we have our nut butter here this is quite a bit thicker as you recall from the other video that stuff would just run off a spoon this stuff is thick now I kind of like all nut butter and this is a good nut butter but it's not nearly as good as that other nut butter if however cashews are off the table for you because of their carbs and you feel like putting in a little extra work it's not a bad nut butter in terms of macros though not a huge difference from the cashew variety so the cashew variety that had six total grams of carbs and three net grams this has 5 total grams of carbs 2 net grams so if for you every gram counts then maybe this is worth it for me I'm gonna stick with a cashew version you can use either version though in my next recipe which is gonna be an amazing breakfast sauce slash dessert topping slash pudding slash fat bomb so make sure you stay tuned for that in the meanwhile if you enjoyed this video click that subscribe button click

today I'm showing you some awesome toppings I'm showing you how to temper it which is really the only tricky part I'm so glad you found this video before we watch this go ahead and subscribe if you haven't already and without further ado let's do this first thing we're going to do is we're gonna get a glass bowl and it's important that we use a glass bowl and not metal one because we're gonna be creating what's called a memory and that's where we put boiling water underneath a bowl to heat up the bowl in a very controlled and precise way so I'm not gonna cheat you guys and just melt down some already made chocolate for these chocolate bars we're gonna control everything here this is the base butter this is actually just like pure fat and this is super keto if you want to make just pure keto chocolate just cocoa powder and cacao butter and boom you got it so this is the beauty of the bain marie it's not gonna overheat and we're gonna actually use a thermometer and when we save a memory hits 95 simply take the bowl off and keep stirring it until the temperature goes back down this is called tempering and we're gonna bring it up to a very specific temperature and that's gonna make the chocolate hard otherwise it's gonna remain soft [Music] and at this point we can just dump in our cocoa powder and that's when this becomes chocolate now it's gonna be very bitter because we don't have any sweetener in it yet of course we can't use sugar so I like using swerve swerve is erythritol and stevia blood and they make a very fine confectioner powder what I'm using is actually the granular time which is why I had to use a mortar and pestle to grind it down into like a finer powder [Music] so I'm gonna be pouring onto a very small silicone tray actually just using my French press the glass insert and my French press so I found this really cute silicone mold at sur La Table at the mall and we're gonna be making these tiny little Hershey fun size bars [Music] the first column I'm just gonna make regular ordinary chocolate just to see how it tastes [Music] and the second column I'm gonna do sea salt and almond slices sea salt works really good with sweet chocolate the third column I'm sprinkling a little bit of instant coffee on it to make these nice little coffee chocolates and lastly I'm using food grade orange oil and some chilli sauce if you don't like spicy just submit the chili oil but man these orange chocolates taste so good orange and dark chocolate works so well together [Music] I think I'm gonna make these a bowl give them away for presents perhaps though my keto friends anyways these turned out so well and bonus points if you can find some gold wrapper for it too to really make it authentic make sure you share the video with someone you know that would love it as always keep it keto and stay healthy peace [Music]", "2-YfrlXaVMk": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying it the Belgian milk chocolate coffee milk chocolate almond and honey and no chocolate salted rice these are squares made in Belgium they were $2.99 per buy and so we're gonna try to milk chocolate coffee first these are individually wrapped it's nice yes very and they're small yes seven pieces are 170 calories said that it's been very very small so this milk chocolate toffee oh wow it's always very good too it's a very creamy chocolate hmm move rich but the toffee pieces are crispy and they're extra sweet mm-hmm so when you get one of those it's like a it's like sugar crystals or something very they're all through up to there's a lot of them in there yeah that's very good the next one is milk chocolate almond and they're a good sweet boy after you've eaten dinner and he wanted something loosely it would be does he want us it would be very good this would be kind of watch the cows you just want something awfully yeah there you don't want there's often times that's exactly how we are yeah I want to something a little yeah whether it be a perfect kiss we were just something small especially after you making something spicy for no no no no no wow that is bad peeps are small like oh okay these are seven pieces on earth and once again it's milk chocolate almond and honey [Music] 24 25 hours 24 calories age that's good nor them the next one is more them that was milk chocolate almond and honey hmm tissues royal I got her sweet chocolate it had little pieces in it too but I don't think it had as many yes the first one who's been sweet though it was very sweet that was good it wasn't as I enjoyed my session by this I enjoyed the person more - but I'm telling you you can't go wrong with it then it goes so incredibly sweet and the chocolate is so nice and smooth it's a good one I'm glad they used to milk chocolate with this yeah we're gonna no I don't want to get your calculator go this one is four pieces is entered 70 and this is the salted Brown no it's 42 42 okay but it's also yes yes and I will have a picture of each one of these at the end so that you could see it up close this is similar to like a chunky or something I love the texture I can taste completely different flavor my dad is more towers but it's so good it's worth it yeah cuz that's like two of those bombs stuck on top of each other of us it really does have a brownie batter kind of flavor mm-hmm and Kevin's used the right word batter that's what it tastes like before you break it yes it tastes like when you've mixed it up in the ball before you bake it in you're just eating the battery back then it's cold I'm in Seoul that is awesome that is definitely a 5 out of 5 oh yeah you get the salt a pavilion all day long I would not hesitate to buy those that's weirdest Alton Brown II know you wouldn't think that would go together but it really does it really goes yeah I have it in my teeth mm-hmm this is an excellent brown they're wonderful I'm so glad that I bought them $2.99 definitely walk to 9:00 a.m. but if you can find that salty brownie you have to try back because that texture is unbelievable and it is like a brownie batter so what were you going to say something we need your God on a Tuesday morning or HomeGoods but we don't know I don't remember which I mean but just in case you want to get them I wanted to tell you where the tag is on the bottom and I don't know if it's a hunger tag or a Tuesday morning tag I just don't remember I need their tags look so similar to me I think it was home again that's what I'm trying that's all I'm sayin yeah I'm thinking this is a hunger tag so I'm pretty sure it was home goods but I mean if you watch my grocery hauls you all probably remember better than I do but I'm thinking that they were in hama goods if not they were Tuesday morning though but I would not hesitate to not spray any of these so the three we tried were excellent I would assume all the other flowers they have your family yeah baby they do they have a wide variety of so everything all the other ones that we saw don't so I will have that picture breads in and thanks for watching [Music]", "eVCS2oXDaeM": "no I ain't her and I are gonna try three more Lent Lindor chocolates these are all new this is orange dark chocolate truffle this one is coconut in milk chocolate and this one is sea salt in milk chocolate so first I think we'll try the orange it's you get three balls for 234 two minutes he's a boy I'm thinking about how pretty it is pretty cool and like I said these are dark chocolate usually bloated that's okay it just looks like a cream that tastes like orange pledge Oh furniture cleaners and the smell of the wood polish is what your taste in your nose he's right I like we've done reviews on Russell Stover chocolates from hallmark Russell Stover makes wonderful creams the orange cream is delicious you can't get anything better than orange cream raspberry cream all those creams are wonderful this doesn't taste like that this reminds me a lime shear at Christmas somebody recommended we tried the it's a chocolate orange it's a certain bar in though of chocolate orange and we tried it and we just thought it was terrible this reminds me of that chocolate orange it's just it's not a cream it's just completely different so I like the orange and chocolate combination just not in this so which one is this angry I love that this is the coconut salt on Christmas I love that color that would you have called that a turquoise no I'm gonna call that aqua or turquoise yeah will you hold the ball on those sides I will not hurt you it's coconut immediate coming up and it's not too strong I'm not a coconut fan and I think that's good I think Kevin would really like this company new resembles of snowball no resemble take five what do you mean it's filling with marshmallow Lee Thomas hostess Mike those the same people that make 20 mm-hmm yeah yeah that is that's good coconut if I ain't coming out all the time how would definitely get those that's not something I would go and buy but it is good but if you like coconut that's a very very good yes salt caramel chocolate I like that blue is this milk chocolate or milk chocolate you can with dark chocolate I find me salivating a little bit harder wonder if you could cut it along that line right there well it exploded well yeah oh there's no salt wait it's very light add salt and be better it is the life but it's good not more like just the chocolate then there's a milk chocolate it took me a minute to get to the song hurdles it's there but it is there and it's very good what you get it is good yeah that is a good it's a good milk chocolate it's creamy in the middle does have a little tiny crunchy salt yeah has about probably six of them yeah that is very good I like it the best I would buy it again and I probably wouldn't buy even one of these because I'm not I'm not in the food connoisseur and definitely I would not get the orange but now would I would actually Bob a sea salt what about you ever um I probably would buy any of them really but you know I think I would probably buy these for my wife she really likes the little chocolates you think she would like those the best no she's trying one right now what do you think it's okay okay she said Oh anyway uh you guys out of the three this one she says the straight white chocolates the best of the reason we didn't try that one tonight is because it's not new we have only tried new ones so thanks for watching", "MsUcbSRjtP8": "there's basically no almonds in the almond milk in your fridge right now wait what did you just say about my almond milk yeah there's no almonds it's just watery emulsifier see even art is shocked so if there's no almonds in my almond milk what's in there well it's mostly water emulsifiers gums and oils and that's a problem which we'll get to in a little bit but if you pour an eight ounce cup of almond milk like this there's about five almonds in that cup and in this whole carton it's only about two percent almonds and that's an issue so in this little expose we're gonna talk about the best almond milks the worst almond milks gonna give you a really good homemade almond milk recipe also gonna touch on

half years and i think you're gonna love them too so this is the kind of almond milk i used to use for smoothies and i thought it was fine but when there's that little almonds and mostly water and emulsifiers it's a problem because common emulsifiers gums and oils like locust bean gum gel and gum xantham gum sunflower lecithin they're not bad but when you stack so many on top of each other like most almond milks have it's a problem because it can be very bloating and very disruptive to your intestines i often times think about back in the day i used to always stop at intelligentsia and get an oat milk latte on the weekends with dessie on our walk and that was my splurge but about an hour afterwards my stomach would be killing that's because oat milk and especially barista additions are loaded with gums and oils to help it froth so that's problem number one but if you look at the nutrition nutrition ingredients of any almond milk there's going to be those emulsifiers see this one word right here there's always natural flavors in almost every even plain or flavored almond milk you guys know how i feel about natural flavors it's another word for artificial flavors there's nothing natural about it you don't want it the good ones that we're going to talk about in a second don't have that stuff and notice how they're always vitamin fortified there's calcium carbonate there's a vitamin a they want to mimic the nutritional profile of cow's milk the problem is they're using really cruddy uh synthetic vitamins and calcium carbonate actually doesn't even absorb into your body it's that cruddy so you don't want that and you'll notice the good ones they don't do that they just make really good almond milk and they're not trying to make it like a cow's milk and if you get one that's flavored check the amount of sugar on there it's always a crazy amount of sugar which is really really bad news so when you go almond milk or any kind of non-dairy milk plain unsweetened is the way to go so now that we know that and now that i don't use something like that what's the best almond milk on the market well it's probably these two i have right here this is the best almond milk on the market it's also art's favorite name ever it's milk reference to bart simpson and the simpsons this is great because if you look at the ingredients here it's three ingredients it's not a laundry list of ingredients and it's water organic sprouted almonds we'll come back to sprouted later and himalayan pink salt not refined table salt unrefined himalayan pink salt which is really good and it's cold pressed meaning it's minimally processed this is your top shelf milk right this is the kind of stuff you might want a cold glass of while having some netflix marathon or if you want milk and cookies this is what i pour a glass of and something like this i use for my smoothies now another great one is three trees which is actually kind of hard to find here in chicago for some reason but if you look at the ingredients this is the pistachio nut milk it's pistachios almonds almond extract and himalayan pink salt once again do you see any gums emulsifiers gels do you see any vitamin fortified no this one isn't sprouted which i'll get to in a minute but it's still fantastic the thrive market almond milk is one of the best economical ones this 34 ounce packet i believe is 249 and look at the ingredients it's water almonds sunflower lecithin is the only emulsifier and then salt so i'll make my smoothies with this because i'm not going to use top shelf for that think of this as like top shelf tequila like george clooney uh casa amiga style this is like that this is like your your well drink you go to the bar you get the cheap well drinks but this is actually a premium well drink so this is what you want to get and the price is great so when you try thrive market using my link down below definitely get this and the oat milk which i'll talk about and then elmhurst elmhorse makes a whole line of um milked almonds milked walnuts that is just two ingredients another great shelf-stable one that is really good for smoothies so these are the ones i would get for everyday use i would stay away from these now i said this one is sprouted see that word what does that mean milk is the only almond milk on the market that sprouted because the almond skin the brown almond skin has anti-nutrients or lectins and when you sprout or soak almonds you remove the anti-nutrient so your body is able to absorb the nutrients in the almonds or whatever you're eating with it no other one on the market is sprouted so this is why it's my favorite top shelf because it's sprouting purpose and even though this is organic even though the thrive market one is organic you don't have to buy organic almond milk it's not a dirty dozen member and it's a tree nut it's protected by its shells and even if they spray the trees which they usually do around the uh tree floor and the grass they actually don't spray the tree itself because when they shake the tree and all the almonds fall they don't want a bunch of weeds and stuff in the way when they're picking up the almonds but you don't have to buy organic and you might say what's the difference bobby between a refrigerated one like this or a refrigerator runs like this and shelf stable almond milks like this these are shelf stable uht ultra high temperature pasteurized these are high temperature short time htst pasteurized which is why in general i like to buy the cold ones because it's not nuked at a super high temperature so it still has some living nutrients in there but once again i'll buy this for my top shelf and i want to have these on hand because i like to have a lot of them to use for my smoothies so that's really important so that's my breakdown of almond milk and what to buy what to avoid but a lot of people like to buy and drink oat milk oatmeal could actually have even more emulsifiers in there so make sure you get ones that have minimal to none malk makes a great one but look at the thrive market organic one two ingredients water and oats this is fantastic for making your smoothies or whipping into your latte for a weekend uh oat milk latte the thing is organic is a must whereas almond milk isn't why we've talked about this many times if it's not organic oats it scores high in glyphosate the active ingredient in roundup so you have to get in my opinion organic oats and um oatly is a very popular one on the market it's not organic but i did my research i looked on their website and uh it is glyphosate free they do get a check for that but you have to get the low fat version of oat leaves it's probably the only time in the world i've recommended low fat because the full fat doesn't have fat it has like fat from oats obviously because there's not in there it has sunflower oil and you don't want that the low-fat one has none but still it has emulsifiers and it has uh added synthetic vitamins so i wouldn't get that i would stick with the malk version of that or once again the thrive market one's great we don't drink soybean oil because uh high omega-6s and it's usually uh what's up you want to drink soybean oil do what i said yeah we don't drink soy milk thank you art i was paying attention we don't drink soy milk because of the high omega-6 ratio and if it's not organic it's none it's a gmo soybeans rice milk really has no nutrition it's very starchy and very sugary and pea milk you have to be careful because peas can oftentimes score high in uh heavy metals like arsenic so you really want to avoid that unless you know that it's like california rice milk so that's what i would do for that you can also make your own almond milk i know a lot of people are watching this right now saying why are you buying these well you can make your own we have a recipe in our cookbook for that three ways chocolate cinnamon and strawberry and on our blog i'll leave the link down below it's super easy and you can sprout your almonds and remove the anti-nutrients and a lot of moms and dads ask me what's the best non-dairy milk to give your toddlers if you don't want to give them cow's milk the answer is hemp milk hemp milk will have the closest nutritional profile to cow's milk the thing is most of them on the market have natural flavors and emulsifiers and i think it's very important with kids not to be adding those gums and emulsifiers to their gut because you could be setting them up for problems uh down the road so make your own you could basically just not even soak them blend them up with water add some coconut cream a little bit of maple syrup and vanilla extract you'll have something so much better than anything at the grocery store so definitely check that out i'll try to find a recipe online and post it in the description box because it's super easy and you can buy a big bag of uh hemp hearts that are loaded with uh omega-3s and uh protein and iron it's fantastic so i almost did the video are without talking about our favorite or your point that's why i was pointing art and i we love that we love and we hate this so this is muallah so many people have asked me about this and i never see it a whole foods but i saw it at jewel oscar in chicago number one is the most confusing product on the market it's mu allah with a picture of a koala so i don't understand that because it's not a cow but i do understand this look at the ingredients it's water bananas sunflower seeds a little bit of emulsifier and then organic it's delicious oh my god i've been using this for my smoothies i gave it to roasty and she loves it the only thing is if you think the name and that is really weird what gets even weirder at her art the story read this story this is a moala pronounced like koala mu allah he has spots like a cow but lives in a tree in fact he is almost like a regular koala except he picks nuts seeds and fruit from his favorite trees blends them into delicious organic plant-based beverages in a secret moala factory shh he then leaves bottles at your favorite grocery store hides and waits for you to pick them up sometimes he follows you home and everyone lived happily ever after okay super creepy reminds me of a chris hanson to catch a predator episode but he makes a great banana milk don't get the flavored ones because they have added sugar and natural flavors the og banana milk is really good once you ignore the rest of the stuff on the bottle there so um that's it you guys i hope you guys

love and peace later", "5BD91FGl3QU": "[Music] hi everybody it's your friends chris and chelsea here from canadacook.com hey guys so today we are doing something that i am super excited about we are going to be showing you how to do cannabis infused chocolate covered almonds yeah it's honestly one of my favorite things i eat pack of them every night so i thought why not make them cannabis infused it'll make it that much better actually almonds are actually kind of good for you yeah but the amount that i eat not so good for me you turn into an almond i may so stick around for this stick around for this really easy recipe for this recipe you will need a double boiler a cup of almonds a cup of melting chocolate i'm gonna be using dark chocolate but you can also use just regular chocolate or white uh parchment paper and then i think i'm gonna do about a fourth a cup of cana butter you can use a fourth or if you want it to be a little bit stronger go for one third cup can of butter so i forgot to mention i'm also going to be adding sea salt onto these chocolate covered almonds you can do that if you would like um this is cannabis infused sea salt for that recipe just go over to canadacook.com it's over there um so this is an optional add-in but i think it's going to be really good because what's better than dark chocolate and sea salt yum so the first thing we're gonna do is get your double broiler going get your water in there i've got mine set just above medium heat i don't want it boiling too much so i would recommend keeping it at medium heat but once this starts boiling we are going to add our chocolate in okay so i think our water is boiling enough to add our chocolate in so we're gonna add chocolate in and um once it is all the way melted then we are going to add the can of butter in [Music] so our chocolate is almost all the way melted there's just a few chunks in there so i am going to start adding the can of butter in um and then once the can of butter is all nice and melted then we are going to start adding the almonds okay so our chocolate and can of butter are melted so now we are going to add our almonds in get everything all nice and mixed around oh yeah okay i didn't want to add them all just in case i didn't have enough chocolate definitely look like you have enough chocolate yes so i'm going to get this all nice and coated i'm going to remove it from heat once all of the almonds are coated and then we are going to transfer them to the parchment paper i'm just going to have chris and i use our forks and just pick them out one at a time [Music] there and try to um make sure they're not touching each other because i don't know if that will like mess up the chocolate covering or not so we're just gonna do this until they're all done all right so we've got all of our almonds transferred to our parchment paper well almost all the almonds didn't know those were in there so the leftover chocolate i'm just gonna take and sprinkle over some of them that are looking a little bit bare and then we're just gonna let these sit and cool and harden up [Music] you", "LnYgYC7CIEw": "today Kevin and I are be trying a five candy bars from world's finest chocolate now I will tell you when I know the the brand world's finest chocolate from when I was growing up when I was young our school our elementary school used to have fundraisers and that's what world's finest chocolate does say if a school is having a fundraiser you can sell their candy bars and make money for the school I think when we were kids this is like this and then they started selling me him and ends in the box right those are the only two things I do for fun right right and at school I cannot wait to try these again because these were some of the best chocolates or they were delicious but let me tell you these are they're half the size of what they used to be and I think that's because they're still a dollar apiece so they haven't raised the price but they have they literally made their it's half the size that used to be it is a recurring one oh yeah it this is a one point three ounce bar I wish I should have tried the Google and all that yes because I know maybe you can put in the comment I mean in the description if I decide to size so these were a dollar each like I said and if you find a child who is fundraising for their school or maybe soccer team or something like that that's where you're going to finally she might find them some kids might go to the door or some kids might be standing outside Walmart so you just have to look and see so we have milk chocolate we have the WUF crisp which is world's finest crisp almond caramel and in darker so we're gonna try the milk chocolate first it's a signature premium milk chocolate it says free coupons for local restaurants and services a hundred and ninety calories for the entire bar for tiny little bar attendants well thank you came about 250 or something hmm there's no easy way whenever keep almost there it's destroyed I don't think there's I didn't see anything okay so it says the world so I'll show you one and then you'll know that the others look just like this it says world's finest on there if you can see it and that you get four four pieces activate your free membership use this access code freedom winners comm code so you bought that way that's good it we've had so many candy bars chocolate bars and brands of chocolate since I last had this so that I think the last time I had it I thought it was like wow but it's awesome chocolate and once you've had other chocolate it's not as the wow factor is not it's good that was like crumbly calm it is good but it's not like it's not like when I was a kid I thought it was something yeah well it's not this rich creamy smooth chocolate got a little brightness to it it's uh it doesn't like dissolve in your mouth right public chocolate you know the crisp bar looks the same except for the bottom it is only a hundred sixty calories so it's milk chocolate with crisp rice again it's good I do see what you mean about like out hand a caramel fibro hmm I don't know what that's coming from chocolate ice cream chocolate is just the chocolate boy I do like the crisp rice and I don't think 160 calories I think that's pretty good for you to be able to eat a candy bar no again these aren't like gourmet chocolates right this is the almond it is hundred ninety calories it says roasted California almonds covered in milk chocolate I think these are bad goods not better than horses oh yeah yeah but harder than that herpes isn't very high on our toes they're not as good as like Cadbury or milk or plant let hey those cookies you're doing all those mm-hmm yeah these were dollar apiece hmm mm-hmm okay you can really taste the almond that's good yeah that almond gives it a different flavor I wondered if it said on here one of these were actually made like what like what's nice you know I like to know where what state things come from I'm just never given the box that came from oh maybe oh no here we go Chicago Illinois manufactured by water fun in Joplin South Alonso Avenue in Chicago Illinois DOS okay so this one the Ullman was good had great on flavor I actually like them nothing right there the others this is the caramel milk chocolate with creamy caramel its 180 calories so still not as much as just milk chocolate I'm wondering if this is gonna be like running mm-hmm mm-hmm hmm good good call now think that one's my favorite one so far against the caramel it's it's very very over-the-top sweet and very rich yes so that for a hundred eighty calories yeah that's nothing that's that is totally the one day that's a very very good and then lastly we have the dark in his rich and smooth dark chocolate and it's back to 190 calories so which is what's the same as the milk the same as the milk yeah and it has a nice snap yeah yeah none of the other one to do that it is it yeah it's your typical dark chocolate it even drives around by the batter collected those good it's not overly bitter in the exact extent but it's not but it yeah it's not too much I think it's better than that special dark RCN oh do you mmm yes I do I think I like the Hershey's special dark better yeah I do I just I just like that that chocolate better look you're gonna bond these from someone by the car by the caramel yeah we'll get the others yes I very quickly because the milk is just it's just so playing there's just it's just all right in the crisp it's not bad you're just having some krispies to it but you know what consider these just like Girl Scout cookies you really not buying it for the candy bar you're making a donation to get the candy bar exactly but I don't think I don't aspire to pay for this no especially wouldn't you know that the schools or school or wherever is getting some yeah and you're getting four pieces of chocolate I mean if you're gonna go in Walmart and spend a dollar on a racy cap anyway why not buy one of these no I don't think that's too much time dollar but no they're not as good as I know they're not it's it's almost like like it's like they've changed the recipe they do not taste at all the way that I remember them because I remember that flavor and if I had tasted it I would have immediately it would have come back and I would have known it did not taste the same to me so I don't know if between the 80s and now that what they what they're doing only a few years ago what not long but it's that something here that's a big problem everywhere those are causal bit to keep minute you can tell but anyway I hope you enjoyed the video if you've ever read the world's finest chocolate let us know which one is your favorite and thanks for watching [Music]", "DQkRQAitP7s": "Today on \"Feel Good\"\nwith me, Hannah, we're making a chocolate mousse\nwith a secret ingredient. Avocado. [music playing] I love this recipe because\nit's the same consistency as a regular mousse, but\nit's totally guilt free. The key to this is\nusing a ripe avocado. The difference between\nan unripe avocado is that it's green\nand hard to touch. But a ripe avocado is brown\nand very easy on the thumb. So I love this recipe because\nit's great for a dinner party because you can make it\nbeforehand and chill it. The reason why you want\nto use a ripe avocado is so that it all\nblends very easily. After I add the avocado, I'm\ngoing to add the cocoa powder. And cocoa powder is\nfull of antioxidants. I'm also going to add an\nunsweetened almond milk, which makes this a really\ngreat vegan dessert option. But if dairy's\nnot an issue, then you can use any milk you want. Maple syrup as my sweetener. But you can use honey\nor agave instead. But it should\ndefinitely be liquid. I'm also going to add vanilla\nand a pinch of salt. Now I'm going to blend this on\nlow for about two minutes. [clock ticking] [bell ding] This looks about perfect. Oh yeah. It's light and creamy. Exactly how we want it. I've made two servings here. And although you can\nconsume this immediately and it is delicious, I think\nit's much better after you chill it for about 30 minutes. Whoa. Whoops. While this is\nchilling, I'm going to clean up and get ready\nfor the best part-- toppings. Now comes the fun part. Here are all the toppings that\nI'm going to use, at least. But you can use whatever\ntoppings you'd like. I'm doing a bunch of fruit. I've got raspberries,\nstrawberries, and blueberries, which I think adds like\na nice layer of sweetness as well as color. This is a great dessert\nto make for a dinner party because you could\nhave a little toppings bar where everyone\nputs their own toppings on it which would be so cute. Then I've made coconut\nwhipped cream, which I think is great, super\neasy, as an alternative to regular whipped cream. All you do is you take\na can of coconut milk and you put it in\nthe refrigerator overnight so that it\nhardens and separates. The top layer will\nbe hard like this and underneath will be coconut\nwater, which you can use for a smoothie or on its own. Then I'm going to\nadd some cocoa nibs which give it a\nnice, crunchy layer, as well as some chia seeds. And even some coconut chips. Let's taste this. Mmm. This is amazing. I hope you enjoyed\nthe episode this week. Catch me next time on \"Feel\nGood\" with me, Hannah.", "Z-ndKyaH35w": "today kevin and i are going to be trying six perigeena chocolates these are from italy made in italy uh chocolate bars they were sent to us from georgian so thank you to georgian i believe i've seen this brand being sold at maybe walgreens someplace like that i'm not sure i've never bought it before so uh but it's it looks uh the name sounds familiar to me um four of them are in milk chocolate two are in dark so we have just the regular milk chocolate milk chocolate with caramelized almonds milk chocolate with caramelized hazelnuts and milk chocolate cappuccino and then these dark chocolate is orange and limoncello so i'm gonna take them away from you okay and i'm going to give you the package there we go okay welcome to the heart of the italian chocolate since in 1907. created by the masters of the period uh here eugenia school of chocolate the pure eugenia milk chocolate is a smooth milk chocolate the delicate color the intense aroma of milk and an enveloping cream creaminess soft of the palette create an enjoyable experience which results from years of passion and the authentic italian tradition indulge in the pure luxury and enjoy an experience of all five senses with pure cocoa butter sustainably sourced cocoa natural vanilla flavor and gluten free three pieces which i'm sure kevin held this up so you could see it three pieces are 180 calories there's eight pieces in there it's nice chocolate it's got a good texture the flavors are really good chocolate it's not like a super milky chocolate but it is a very good chocolate it's not like a milka or something like that it's made by nestle but it is very good how was it yes nestlets it kind of reminds me of a nestle chocolate just so maybe a little bit better it's yes i think this is better than your average candy bar this is yeah so i don't know how much georgian paid for these where she got them but this is better than um a lot of other i'm not gonna throw anybody under the bus but this is creamier this is a um even though it's milk chocolate it just has a it has more depth to it you know that's good it's delicious yeah i like that a lot um it might be cheaper than something else but it doesn't taste that way no not at all i think it's delicious this is the milk chocolate with caramelized almonds the package is not hard to open it says the crunchy extravagance of caramelized almonds and the intense aroma of milk and an enveloping creaminess you can see the little almonds in the back so it's going to be crunchy caramelized almonds three pieces is 180 so that's the same as the first one [Music] [Applause] almond flavor i'll tell you what you you can't avoid them because they're they've um crushed them up they're tiny which is good but they're tiny and so they're all throughout that chocolate um i i like that i think that's delicious it's it's just as good as the first one they've just added the almonds but out of the two i think i'd prefer this just like a regular because you can put that on your tongue and just let it melt with no interference at all and this one you have those almonds that kind of interfere with the creaminess it's still creamy but it interferes with that creaminess so i'd rather have just the milk but that is delicious now this one is with hazelnuts and we'll have to see how strong these hazelnuts are you're going to be an expert at opening these plants they're really easy it's literally not sealed you haven't watched it no i haven't watched you at all i've been i've been talking the whole time imagine that unlike me at all it's not glued it's just it's just folded up oh okay i like that that's not oh gosh talk about filled wow uh this one's also three pieces of 180. um it looks like the only one and it's um hazel milk chocolate and hazelnuts crunchy creamy it says basically the same thing except it has hazelnuts now that one felt a little softer probably wasn't but it felt that way i went on youtube to um see how to pronounce that because i didn't want to totally butcher it the name perry gina and somebody had put from 2013 and put a factory tour so it looked like kind of like what me and kevin did you get a like a tour group and that's what it seemed like somebody filmed it but just like we did um but you get to go in and they show you this uh a film it's only like 10 minutes on the factory and how they make it the history and then you get to try some of their chocolate you get to go through the factory and i'm sure they have a gift shop i think you get some free chocolate when you go but it looked really really incredible the experience of it and they talked to you about it everything um this is my favorite so far the heat the hazelnut's really good yes the hazelnuts are delicious you clearly know that this is hazelnut it's not too nutty though no that's good and the size wise they're about the same as the almonds but the the hazelnut i don't know well it's just stronger flavor but it's then again it's not too much um and i just love that makes milk chocolate okay the next one is the cappuccino you have two pictures into this one i'm wondering um as far as like the factory zero goes is that one of those things that like was a day trip and they chose to do or was that one of the stops on the tour you know because we took that bus to wales and they automatically take you into the shop we didn't go in there no um because they want to sell you spoons yeah with spoons and stuff right and then i've heard people on the radio talk about how they went um i swear it was like in italy well there's a lot of gift shops we went to and they take them to like a diamond place and they're hoping you'll buy something so i'm wondering was this a choice that they went there i would think so because this is a very specialized place this is the cappuccino is this for me and it's time calories oh wow i'm not usually into the coffee flavored chocolates but that is really really good that's probably one of my favorite coffee flavored chocolates you know why because it tastes like a sweet creamered coffee that's good i've said this before with coffee flavor things this specific flavor this cappuccino it tastes like the jelly belly identical yeah it's very very good that like i said that's probably one of my favorite coffee flavored chocolates it's really really good if you've ever had the jelly belly jelly bang cappuccino this is spot on i don't know i see some little things in there i'm assuming they're coffee that's incredible it is absolutely incredible full honestly it's not one i would want all the time because i'm not gonna want that cappuccino flavor all the time but boy i sure would be getting it around yes i love that i'm kind of leaning towards that being my favorite oh i can understand that i mean it's very good okay now we're gonna we have two left and they're both dark chocolate okay so if this will be fun to see how how dark are they um this is the orange yellow orange and dark chocolate which like things just a personal preference yeah i wonder if those are like little pieces of peel personal preference i prefer orange in milk chocolate but that's okay i like it in dark chocolate too i just would rather have it milk um i don't know something chewy that should be the the zest the uh like when they put it in the marmalade yeah um because you can feel it kind of tugging when you pull it apart it just is talking about it's uh 51 cacao and orange fruity notes the calories are different three pieces is 160. instead of 180. the orange i thought it was going to be like this really chewy texture but it's not in fact i didn't really get any chewiness at all that's a nice orange and the chocolate um it melts really nice but it's still got a snap to it um it's a little dark and bittery um dry your mouth out a little bit but not really bad that's taking over my number one that's really um that's my number one orange chocolate i really do i love that that is chocolate it's really good and uh um uh the milk the uh dark chocolate um it has a snack to it uh that crunch i absolutely love this this is perfect uh yeah that one i would get again and again and again now lemon worries me a little bit but we'll see um limoncello dark chocolate deep and intense 51 just like the last one no this one's getting some lemon little candies in the back okay sorry so this is lemon and dark chocolate and it's 170 calories so this one's different so the orange was 160 for three pieces this is 170. that's not bad either this one's even more snap really searching for a lemon i know you get it wait till it gets to the very back of your tongue the touch that's a nice dark chocolate i like the chocolate don't care for the lemon yeah for me once it hit the back of my tongue it's a um it's on the cleaner side of lemon for me i mean it's like right there yeah it's too much so that one i would not get again um yeah out of all of the candy bars that one would be the it would be the only one i wouldn't get and i just i just it's not for me unless i didn't give you you didn't get anything limited i'm not even absolutely shocking but for me it's like now that i have that in my mouth you don't taste you don't taste anything else i didn't get lemon just a dark chocolate flavor so you have to pick but i tell you what if you had just a dark chocolate candy bar from them and you like dark chocolate even a little bit i think you would enjoy it just pure dark chocolate oh it's it's very very good it's delicious you have to pick your top three you only have enough money no three yeah i got easily to pick three i can pick three uh the cappuccino 100 okay the regular milk chocolate in the hazelnut um and i'm gonna pick the orange number one the gosh that's hard uh i'm gonna pick the cappuccino and then the hazelnut yeah and when you said you didn't pick orange i picked the regular chocolate okay so kevin's was this one if i tell you what if they had a regular just a solid dark chocolate bar i probably would have chose it over the hazelnut one because the dark is so good so good and i'm not even a dark chocolate no we're not dark chocolate people really i mean we're always going to pick milk over that but now for me it it this is like um the one from the uk that uh uh one of my very very favorites is that cadbury jamaica rum it is absolutely incredible and it's dark and so this this is right up there this is absolutely wonderful so it's good candy bars i don't know how much they are but but um no george anne if you don't mind uh if you do it's okay you don't have to tell anybody where you found them or how much you paid or anything but if you don't mind i think people would be curious about how much they cost because they're good size this is uh there's two and a half servings in the container so um it would not surprise me at all if they were three dollars a piece or more uh just because you do get two and a half servings right surprises it might be 50 cents [Music] but you never know about chocolate sometimes the cheap chocolate tastes better than the expenses sometimes it does sometimes it does it is surprising but i think it would be fun to visit italy and get to go through their factory that would be really really a wonderful thing to do so i hope you enjoyed the video if you've ever had this brand if you've ever had any other flavors let us know your thoughts what you thought and thanks for watching [Music] you", "pRhRirKEFww": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "WX6wyB_6O6Y": "today Kevin out retrying the elevation fruit and nut bars this is the cranberry almond the almond and coconut floodwall maple glazed pecan and sea salt these are distributed about all day they were 349 at Ollie there I was made in Canada so yeah 349 box for four bars there's still less than a dollar bar this is yeah that's not bad this is a low-sodium gluten-free zero trans fat compared to kind plus fruit and nut bars so that's nice to know that you can compare them to a kind bar that's like their branded bent all right I want to open it yeah this way it has a little tired that's on the bottom yeah it would be on the bottom yeah mine's on the bottom that I got up on the table too okay this puts the disposable this is the cranberry almond it says Millville is now offering an extensive line of better-for-you products elevation fruit and net bars are carefully crafted with high quality ingredients no added sulfites contains four grams of protein three grams of fiber 0 milligrams of cholesterol and provide an excellent source of antioxidant vitamins A C and E gear up and grab a bar to kickstart your journey with elevation these are 190 calories which is completely normal for a bar and if you hear thunder that's because it's Toya there's a lot more collected though it has almost cranberries oh I get the almonds the cranberry presents the main flavors like that is mainly what it is yeah that's what I'm mostly good ten percent quinoa on there chef EOKA syrup honey rice crisps macadamia nuts no I didn't get a macadamia yo maybe they just didn't stand out well that's a good if you like nutty almond deep flavor with that cranberry flavor that's really good yeah it's not like I didn't like it a lot but you're okay with it I don't know and just there was something in there that I don't know maybe was the macadamia nut I know that's what I'm wondering if I didn't get a too big of a flavor and I like macadamia net but it's not one that I like like Oh to eat bad so this is the almond and coconut you confirm it yeah see that was better that boy yeah cuz macadamia nuts do have a distinctive oh they're very very it's a very strong flavor nut and I like them but I usually have them in other things and know that now that white was delicious now this is not a thick bar it doesn't look like it has this much going on oh man the coconut it is 190 I wonder if it's oh it's same color yeah Wow cuz there's not appearances much that the much stickier ball mm-hmm that's very good this thick compare this to the kind free nut ball mmm-hmm don't aim said something simply do the coconut no that's delicious there's good know like it's all coconut though you don't like coconut why not gonna be in favor for food that is so worth 190 calories it's sweet I'm still chewing on its sweetened coconut - it tastes like a sweet coconut play not just uh coconut that is delicious so would you rather salmon with con Mars calls I know what I'm wondering it has and we've had a lot of them sent to us from whites I know Sarah said as a bunch from California but I don't know how much she pays for a box oh no these are 349 I don't think that's a bad price at all not that I'm actually good because I think you you would get filled up frigid for a happening snack that's nice yeah I really really like that and this one is the maple glaze a con and sea salt let me show you this one's a little darker yeah I can smell the maple can you smell that yeah oh yeah that smells like candy mm-hmm then it's 192 now Chooch in for that one it reminds me a little bit of those pecan walls you know the round logs have the compliment they got like a nougat in the middle you're right I liked it while I was eating it mm-hmm now that it's gone I've still got this flavor of this maple Lee flavor lingering out that's kind of I don't like maple by itself because it's so strong and how much to the point of being like a mocha like flavor mm-hmm that's what that's all I'm left with is that really strong maple if you like maple and you're gonna lie but I think it's good I don't like the aftertaste of that mate do you get that it's kind of God or chemical kind of off-putting for me it's very strong um well that one was good the Covenant was my favorite though this counter that one is absolutely delivered it is delicious I'm glad I took the second bite of the cranberry almond though because I just happened to get a bite of macadamia as strongly and it just put me off so that second bite I got all the almond and the cranberry so the one by it was very very good so but the for me I think my order is gonna be different than yours how order is coconut coconut for me thankful and then cranberry even though I liked it yeah mine's gonna be just switching the cranberry in in the mate right your second is gonna be cranberry on your last it's gonna be bad yeah just because it's such a strong maple flavor but if you like maple like I said you like that flavor you're gonna love it ah this is just delicious absolutely delicious and I can't read if their fruit and net bars the kind bar some of them are farmer and they're like crispy and they're like break off you know I'm think I don't want to have lots of nuts and stuff like this like chewy something they work on hard ok with it because I if they are I would prefer to have ones that are that are chewy like this because a lot of those bars are there just to crunching it's like I don't want to crunch into it bite into it and it go everywhere you know shatter like glass I would rather have something chewy like this so well coconut you can't go wrong no no wrong no these are very very good so you all will have to let me know in the comments below how much a box a four of the con bars are if they're comparable things like I said these were 349 so I will have a picture for you at the end I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks

saw this exclusive flavour of dub this is the sea salt caramel in dark chocolate and so we thought we would compare it to the caramel and milk chocolate the this one is not new it's just new to us so we thought we would get it the both packages were 384 I would have thought that this one would have been a little cheaper because it's a smaller bag this is only eight and a half ounces and that one's not and a half ounces so I would have thought it would have been a little cheaper but I guess because it's an exclusive flavor maybe that's why I don't know on the back it just says dev silky smooth

pieces for 200 calories these are gonna be I'm morning regular milk chocolate everybody loves milk chocolate caramel let me see what is your message time and I'm not a big dark chocolate person so man says you worked hard promised yourself a reward completion is fun giving in is even better oh really good strong calm and it's other hard homeless it's between hard coral and like the Carmela's words they run everywhere like water this is firm enough to where I think we bit into it probably wouldn't run out really fast I mean if you let's sit there would but I don't think it would like run out like water they're a little thicker than its thicker than a caramel Oh candy bar but it's not yeah it's not runny but it's really nice and considered flavor heat sink down into it I like that a lot yeah that was very good now like sea salt caramel but I'm not a big dark chocolate fan so we'll see how this works you see if you can taste the salt this one says small more Mon says give yourself permission that's what the caramel looks like inside watching you see it I like that it's not hard I can't taste the caramel how nice yeah all I taste is a jar mm-hmm you might as well not have a caramel there yeah the words I can tell caramel has no JZ it's almost like when you've been into it even though you know caramel was in the middle it tastes like that was full of milk chocolate yeah what goes I mean dark choc ice all a dark chocolate does yeah instead of being caramel in the middle it's like a dark chocolate filled your mouth that's kind of this point I was expecting more of a caramel flavor but you don't and I don't waste any sea salt no it's it's truly like eating a dark chocolate dove candy like the regular dark chocolate that's that's what you taste now it could be because we just ate no I can't imagine not tasting any car at all yeah no sea salt no but if you like milk dark chocolate you would like that because that dark chocolate taste is for your mouth now if we were to have that compared to the dove chart the dark talking about though it might taste a little different but I truly don't taste any caramel in flavor no not enough to buy not enough to buy go rush out and buy just or paid the same amount for a smaller bag as you would for a big bag yeah and I like the regular caramel anyway better so but yeah the milk truck out of the two the milk chocolate was definitely better than the regular caramel yeah you lost two more calories though but but it is it does taste bad the good ones always are more calories", "HCiKlgFVcIE": "- Ever wish that a\ncookie could be magical? Magic cookie bars are real. They are so delicious, filled with so many flavors, coconut, pecans, peanut butter,\nchocolate, graham crackers, the works, they're amazing and just beyond easy. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen where I John Kanell teach you\nhow to make homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookie bars are\ngonna be done in a snap. So let's get started. First off, I'm making a super\neasy graham cracker crust but I always to add in a little of a nut because I'm a nut. First off, we're gonna make a super easy graham cracker crust however, if you watch this channel, you know that I always add\neither pecans or walnuts into my graham cracker crust for extra depth of flavor and a little bit more crunch. Half a cup, in you go. And you can kind of like eyeball it, it doesn't matter. You can add a little bit more, you can add a little bit less. Now I'm adding in eight and that's four, which makes 12 graham crackers. If you don't have graham crackers, you could use Biscoff cookies, any kind of general\ncookie will work for this. One and a quarter cups ish if you're measuring it out that way. All right now, put this top on and give it a whizz whizz whizz. (whizzing) All right, once you have\na nice set of fine crumbs, what you're gonna do is add in half a cup or 113 grams of melted butter. Pulse that in as well. In you go, one last pulse. You can of course do this\nin like a big plastic bag. If you're adding nuts in, give them a fine chop, try and mince them up and if you want, you could do it all in a plastic bag, just pour the melted\nbutter in and mush it up or you could transfer it to a bowl and stir it together. It doesn't really matter either way. Let's give this a little taste and see what it's like. That's nice. Magic cookie bars are pretty sweet. So we're not adding\nany sugar into the base and we're gonna add a little\nbit of sea salt on top for some extra balance. All right, now it's time to transfer this to our prepared dish but let's talk about that for a second. You have a couple of\nchoices on how to line it. You definitely definitely want to line it otherwise this will be\na horrible sticky mess. It'll be stuck in there and not fun at all. You could use foil but if you use foil, it can rip and you get little cracks, you get little wrinkles, not the best deal. Use parchment paper. All you have to do is get a piece, place your pan on here, find the bottom and give it four snips. One, two, three, four. Now fold the edges. It's just like wrapping half of a present. Last one. Now we can take our paper, place it in and it should just fall into place. If it doesn't, you can refold or resnip. We have a nice comfy cozy little place for our magic cookie bars to sit. If you see the paper is like really just not staying up, you can use a couple dabs of butter but I'm not gonna worry about it. All right, carefully remove\nthat dangerous blade. Once you learn your\nlesson, you never forget. Right, dump this mixture in and if you used a food processor, you might have like a little pooling of the butter in one place or another. So just use a spatula and kind of move it around a bit. There we go. Dump it all in. And now spread it around. This is basically just like making any other graham cracker\ncrust you've ever made. And if you haven't made one, it's a great place to start. Now, use a flat bottomed\nglass or a measuring cup and just press, press, press, press. And the key is to press hard. You really want to\ncompact this into a crust otherwise, it'll be very crumbly. Press, press, press. The last thing you want to do is get the edge and you can just drag\nyour cup along the side and for the very corners, just use your fingers. This is a really fun\nproject to do with kids. Mine are napping right now so they can't help. We have a little bit of\nextra time on our hands so I made a cardboard castle and they are totally into it. I'm very happy, I love castles. Just like when I was a kid. All right, this is\nready for the next step. These magic cookie bars\ncome together so quickly and if you're missing any ingredients, you can easily substitute. Like let's say you don't\nhave graham crackers or any cookies at hand, you could make a\nshortbread crust, so easy. If you don't have chocolate chips, use chopped chocolate, sub in something else you like, you could even skip the\nchocolate all together. Now it's time to add our\ningredients onto our base. This is so easy and quick and by the by, this tastes really similar to a Samoa Girl Scout cookie in case you're wondering. It's actually my favorite\nGirl Scout cookie although Thin Mints are\na very close second. So we have three quarters\nof a cup of chocolate chips, three quarters of a cup\nof peanut butter chips and three quarters of a cup\nof toasted and chopped pecans. If you ever use nuts in a recipe, I highly recommend toasting them. Usually, it's like 350 on\na baking sheet, 10 minutes, mix 'em around every like four minutes or three minutes or so. Take those chocolate chips, scatter them evenly over the surface. If you love chocolate, you could add a little bit more. If chocolate's not your favorite, add a little bit less. This is like the most\nforgiving recipe possible so even the measurements are super rough, like you don't need to\ngo the exact gram at all. All right, so it's a\nlittle, that looks good. Now, it's time for the\npeanut butter chips. So scatter, scatter, scatter. If you're not a fan of\npeanut butter chips, you could use like toffee bits, you could use white\nchocolate chips instead. It's really like anything. Or add more regular chocolate chips. Now it's time for my favorite ingredient, sweetened, shredded coconut. I love this stuff. Click up here for my\nGerman chocolate cake. It is the best thing ever. It's one of my favorite cake recipes, even though, you know,\nI have many favorites. Okay, you want about one and\none third cups of this stuff. However, you're using most of a package. So less than seven ounces or if you want to go crazy\nthe full seven ounces. It's really however much you like. I love coconut so I'll be very liberal\nwith my measuring here. Break it apart and sprinkle it out. It tends to kind of glom\ntogether in the bag. What I look for is even coverage. I want all the cookies\nto have a good amount of this delicious coconut. Now it's time for our pecans. So once again, this is about\nthree quarters of a cup, roughly chopped. I'm going crazy and adding the full cup. I have good coverage, all my ingredients are in place except for the binding agent. If you guys baked it right now, it would be like a crumbly fluffy mess. So we need to pour some\ndelicious, delicious sweetened condensed milk on here. Pop a 14 ounce can open. It's almost 400 grams. Depending on which brand you use, they'll be milky white or a\nlittle bit more caramel colored. We're just gonna drizzle\nit over the surface now. Try and get some nice\neven coverage once again. Okay, I like to get all that\ncan out of there because there's always like a\nlittle bit of coconut that's just kind of by itself and I know that it needs\nthat sweetened condensed milk otherwise it might get burnt. Okay, this is technically done but I'm adding in one final ingredient and that's because there's a\nlot of sweet stuff in here. It's like sweet, sweet,\nsweet, sweet, sweet, I want a little bit of balance in here, that's why I added extra nuts and on top, a scattering\nof flaked sea salt. This is that Maldon sea salt. You can get different brands but they're like giant salt flakes. So just a little goes a long way. This also gives you like a nice crunch. This is gonna go into the oven at 350 for about half an hour. You're gonna see it turn\nlike nice and golden but it won't necessarily be set. It has to chill first. So into the oven and we'll be right back. Okay, I ended up backing these\nfor like 35 minutes or so. I wanted to give them just\na little bit of extra color 'cause that's the mood I'm\nin today and by the by, I forgot to tell you the\nvery last part of this was to just sprinkle some chocolate chips on at the very end. If you forgot that, like I did, you can just sprinkle them\non fresh out of the oven and it's totally fine 'cause it's super hot out of the oven and they turn into liquid right away and kind of glue\nthemselves onto these bars. So just FYI. Afterwards, let them chill for two hours. You can pop them into the fridge. I just let them sit out\nat room temperature. And now it's time to transfer. And this is why it's so amazing to have parchment paper at the bottom. Just do a little test pull at the corners, test, test, test, see if anything stuck and if it didn't, now you lift one end up, pull the other end out and there you go, how easy was that? Sometimes recipes will tell you to brush the inside of the\nparchment paper with oil. But I found that is actually\nnot super necessary. See it comes right off and now you're ready to chop, chop, chop and get to eating. You can cut these in\nwhatever shape you want. It could be triangles,\nlittle tiny bars or squares. It's really how many\npeople are you feeding and what kind of portion control are you trying to get them to buy into. Okay, I'm gonna cut these into square and they're easier to cut, I find at room temperature, because they cut really cleanly but they're not super hard. Now I know that I deserve the first piece. Time for a bite. These cookie bars are totally reminding me of my childhood. My mom actually never made them but my friends mom's did. So these would be like my\nsnack at my friend's houses, if that makes sense. If you like this recipe, check out my cookie playlist. So many delicious cookies and cookie bars. There's guaranteed to be\nseveral that you love. Mmm, I love the coconut\nin this and the crunch. It's so good.

sweet life these are no sugar added treats so they say they're new they were $5.99 a bag at Whole Foods and this these are these three are all milk chocolate so we have milk trucks milk chocolates style they use the word style so Kevin's actually said your java period mine's a style so we have covered peanuts covered almonds and covered caramel I'm gonna have dark chocolate covered corns and dark chocolate caramel puppy okay so we're gonna try the peanuts first it says move over sugar we'll take it from here we decided to have trouble it was too good to let sugar get in the way until we created a whole line of unbelievable treats botanically sweetened with stevia and you know what happens life cuts sweeter and here we are you meaning our milk chocolate style covered peanuts and us already bragging about their silky goodness and peanutty crunchiness not even they're embarrassed about it they're that good less sugar sweet life so less than a gram of sugar they're certified gluten-free Lilly's doc Pomus or website we're gonna measure some out for you because they don't give an exact amount there's three and a half servings in this bag 28 grams one ounce is a hundred fifty calories and the calories different from bag bag so so 28 grams how many peanuts how many peanuts are we gonna get take one of them exactly 28 44 14 or 15 problem one okay there's no very community they have 40% cut out hmm I get the peanut butter mm-hmm that is mainly what you taste is the peanut mmm that gets the bitterness from the chocolate mm-hmm it is i it's like a raw it's a raw peanut with nothing fancy done to it like a salt no rush sickness no anything yeah it's like a dry roasted peanuts they have that rustic flavor though yeah it's just a peanut just a peanut that's been dried out yeah what do you think of that the chocolate had the bitterness to me almost like a dark chocolate yeah it does it's only 40 percent milk chocolate style which whatever that means but yeah there's not a lot of sweetness to that at all no sweetness that I could now I could I could eat those if I was a lot of these lilies or their keto friendly because there's no sugar at it I can eat those if I have to I could take but not I could I would eat these long before I would eat one of the this brands candy bar owners cups or the peanut butter cups yes I would metro to have one of these these are the same thing but almonds 28 grams that are 40 calories so it's just the road it's like how many exactly 28 ma it does begin 1212 okay I like you guys um boy yes I like those better than the peanut I've always liked like back when I ate Hershey bars I've done anymore cuz I think it's inferior chocolate but back when I ain't Hershey bars I always liked the ones with almonds because you can really taste the owner hmm you can really taste the almond anything and but just know there's a it's a plain Jane almond just like the peanut yeah giant peanut that milk chocolate style add some texture to it and it's a little bit of us it's a nice little texture that it adds to it but it does have some better sir but that is that it's a lot better than the peanuts oh yeah and still again they say they're sweetened with stevia stevia must not be a very sweet sweetness because it's sure you would never know that sweet this is the caramel and 28 grams are 100 calories that's 29 so how many do you get 429 Finn okay and you got 10 okay so that this is caramel x' as well so we won't have to wipe these out you should get about 10 of these as well now these are all scary to me because caramel here's your sweet mm-hmm that's your waffle again mm-hmm it's a firmer well not running there is some sweetness there a little bit mm-hmm back home always stuck in your teeth really bad though honestly though that's probably one of the best things we've had from this brain yeah yeah but those those milk chocolate style caramels yeah though those I will say those are the best things yeah yeah cuz they add a little bit of that milky caramel flavor they do have weakness you're like caramel and nothing else was brand new something sweet at all I'll just somebody's absolutely yeah this is the same way so whatever he said we got for the milk you'll been of these but these are 110 calories mine those would be like a door for chocolate do you pray like those yeah adds a lot more bitterness to them yeah I don't mind it but given the choice I would always pick the middle yeah yeah because it does have a very dark chocolate the chocolate what's 70 now 55 50% cocoa but it still comes across it's about a seven NATO and comes crosses with our position of sweetness they're right but the caramel the card that caramel even helps that dark chocolate good does now lastly we have dark chocolate caramel popcorn is in mill 28 grams is 110 and little big so you pray don't have any like that's 27 right there six six seven when I was gonna smoke I'm getting a big one look as well hey hey see much with a well hello that humble corn flavor but not much I think you didn't know it takes it like this let's go a little bit of that crunchy caramel Cody yeah it's supposed to be caramel popcorn and I got a little bit of the crunch really just maybe a slight hint of the tape it's almost it's us for a better job yeah it's just yeah you yeah you're getting a texture yeah popcorn in there a pearl horn but you don't I didn't get any sweetness from it at all dude guess we just got the the texture from it and if anything I wish I had picked a smaller another bigger one because with them being for some reason it seemed like I got more dark chocolate on that than I did on the thicker it was their day Wow no what's that I think if you like their dark chocolate though the Lily's dark chocolate I think you'll like this because it does have a good amount of caffeine only I know they definitely put a thick coating on they have well the common milk chocolate Carlos is really the only thing the milk chocolate caramel was I think so we this is our third we tried some Lily's chocolate bars years ago so if you look in the playlist you're gonna see another video from Lily's that was done a long time ago with two chocolate bars but so I can tell you out of everything we've ever tried from them the best thing is these milk chocolate style and cover caramel best thing and if I had to pick something else I would pick the on one of those almonds yeah the almonds I would pick the milk the milk almond anything else I would don't get them for for this render people even render stuff exactly we need our and our need low sugar I'm trying out and you like a bit yeah you might feel differently if you are a really big dark chocolate lover then you know you might really enjoy this but for for people who eat everything you know it's not something we would choose so I hope you enjoyed the video I'll have a picture of each of these for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "ozEOg6okRRU": "today Kevin and I are maybe trying the new alumna Rica or ICA I'm assuming that's a recap of Luna Rica bars this is the salted caramel nut chocolate peanut butter it's brown and I talked about coconut almond these were a dollar fifty each and the reason I even knew your look for these is because Rachel told me about them so thank you very much to Rachel these were in our Kroger they were not back where the nutrition ones were at least at this time they were actually up front in a like lengths and a little metal display yeah so we're going to try the salted caramel nut first the NS cashew butter filled with fruit can shoot that are filled fruit and net bar these are gluten-free non-gmo USDA Organic Lorraine Canada they are made in Canada yes they are a hundred seventy calories I'm gonna open this carefully because I still need to take a picture of the nutrition on the back it was their way bit it's just it's just hard to take a picture with it twisted okay you want to hold that up yeah looks like something you'd fun in the forest it has a little like 4 segmented that's the bottom then that looked like something you'd find on the floor of the forest that was left bus on attaboy okay so salted caramel nut filled with cash you better know they're actually yeah they're filled with this one sure so you saw a pocket has cashew butter mm-hmm how's your thought I'm surprised that cashew butter is has a really good flavor and I taste mostly like a date or either date or raising an exam I actually like that a lot the first ingredient is organic daypack okay and then organic cashew butter and then peanut butter oh that's good no I thought I don't know that I would have identified it and salted caramel oh no I'm just purely some cashew butter today we do pellets all the trouble but I do like it but notice they call us all the time yeah it's all too common I love it no it doesn't make like a little rough but it does have a good the only negative thing I could say about this is it's co so soft you were gonna eat this quickly and I mean if you make yourself you can get each bite each one of squares to do - mm-hmm yeah that's eight bite but you're gonna have to make yourself cuz cuz it's soft so this is chocolate peanut butter with peanut filled with peanut butter did you say the calories no I don't saying that is opening oh did you want to know I didn't mean to take out her this is a hundred sixty calories and this still has organic de paste is the first ingredient and already peanut butter is the second ingredient and then unsweetened chocolate is the third sorry this is a little tougher Oh firmer the person was like really saw this one's kind of farm and I'm on that one that the chocolate is will darker when more like cocoa it's a very end that's the way you know it this fruit and nut bar and I swear up I was tasting a French in there more than I placed in the present day okay yeah the dates are pretty strong these your boxes I like it yeah I do like it you know think I don't know about I like the texture of that one better than the party like a fun one I like the flavor of the first one see I like the softer firstly I would just eat that so no we're two virgins like I like that texture yeah I would just eat that so quickly I know myself it would be gone and I'd be like what happened you know I think I don't have a darker chocolate cocoa conflate or two so this one is the looks just like the last one coconut and sorry chocolate coconut almond and it's filled with almond butter next 170 calories and that's where that texture is between the first two little softer than Simon but far more than the first I like I probably like that one don't still think that'd be my second one but the flavor I like flares that date is still the strongest library yes but you can really taste the coconut in there no you're definitely the coconut so even though I know you like the first one it did not it was not salted caramel no no but it was nowhere near for me the third one which does taste kind of like what it says yeah it takes like dancing coconut yeah Dave the coconut that's look so so my favorite is still the first one because I like that extra flavor and my favorite is the single one chocolate peanut butter so but all three of them organic they're good they're better than I was expecting yes they're all for a good bar so hopefully you get the opportunity to try out thank you again to Rachael for telling me about I will have a picture free at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "JhQGkRMifs4": "today i'm going to be making some sea salt caramel m m bars we're going to go over the ingredients you need first you need one cup or two sticks of unsalted butter 3 4 cup granulated sugar 1 cup of light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon of vanilla 1 teaspoon of baking soda and that same bowl is a half teaspoon of salt three and one fourth cup of flour which that that's all-purpose flour then you need uh it's one and a half cups of your sea salt caramel baking truffles and so basically you're going to use this entire package this is a nine ounce package you just plan on using all of it one 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk and then one four ounce uh m m uh chocolate bar you could pick whatever m m's chocolate bar you want they come in different flavors so you could pick any flavor i just picked the one with the uh the regular milk chocolate and the minis okay i melted my butter or pretty much melted it i got it really really soft and i'm gonna add that to my mixer and then to this you're going to add both sugars your brown sugar and your regular sugar and you're going to combine these and you do that while your butter still is hot so if you heat it up in the microwave to melt it then you you just put it go ahead and put it in here while it's still hot okay so now you want to add your eggs one at a time at this time you want to add your vanilla this is your salt and your baking soda and you're just gonna add it to your flour and you can kind of whisk it together like this not a big deal and you're gonna add this uh little by little to your um egg mixture so i'm gonna start off with some and then i'll keep adding more this is your um your cookie dough and then to that you want to stir in your sea salt caramel baking truffles and you could add any um any baking chips that you want i chose the sea salt caramel because i don't recall these were out last year but i don't think we bought these and so i wanted to try something different but now um they have all kinds of fun flavor chips so you could buy any of those and just pick whatever you want i tried one of these though and just popped a couple in my mouth and it is a darker chocolate so you just need to know that these are not they're not milk chocolate they're not overly sweet it's kind of a it tastes like your typical nestle tell us like baking morsel but it had it does have a sea salt caramel flavor in the center so now you want to take half of this half of this dough and put it uh i used a we call this our lasagna pan it's a 9x13 inch pan i've lined it with parchment paper i didn't grease it because normally stuff doesn't stick to the parchment paper but you want to take half of your dough and you want to uh press it into the bottom of this pan and you can see i use my fancy clips just to hold my paper in place until i get my dough started and so now i'll press this flat now you're going to take your can of sweetened condensed milk and you're going to leave leave a little spice around the edge because you don't want a bunch of that running running over the edge [Music] so now you want to take your m m's chocolate bar and open this up and you're going to break it up and put it over the top see how cute cute that is so just put little squares of that everywhere and now you take the remainder of your cookie dough and take it um take it in your hands and then you want to kind of crumble it over the top now what i want to do is you want to take this whole pan you don't have to cover it or anything but just take the whole pan and put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes this has been in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes but when it's about 20 minutes into it you want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees you're going to at the end of the 30 minutes you're going to take this out put it into your 350 degree oven and you are going to bake these for 30 to 35 minutes i'm gonna bake them for 32 minutes and then we'll be back so i left mine for 32 minutes and this is how it looks you are supposed to let it cool completely before you cut it into bars so i would say if i had to guess it's going to take a good hour for this to cool completely um resist the temptation yeah you have to resist the temperature kevin said that it looked like uh it looked like it would need marshmallows and i told him i said yeah it does kind of give off a s'mores type of vibe um so but anyway we're gonna let this cool and then we'll be back it's been 45 minutes and this pan is still holding in the heat it's still really hot so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to pick this paper up and quickly move the whole thing over to a cooling rack and i think it will cool quicker uh we'll see if that helps so like i said i'm gonna go quickly there we go and you see that it didn't stick or anything like that so as long as you use parchment paper you don't need any spray now if you use uh aluminum foil you definitely need to use spray but with just the parchment you don't so i'm gonna leave it for another 15 minutes and we'll see if it cools off completely okay it's been actually probably an hour and a half but i'm going to cut these i'm just going to cut them into bars okay we're going to dive in but now i will tell you i've said this before in uh reviews to me a good bar a bar is something that you should be able to pick up with your fingers and eat this you could not pick this up you could it would be a little sticky it'd be sticky yeah i do really like the um the caramel uh chips the truffles i like those that adds a lot of flavor and you can taste that caramel i think what adds a lot of um that stickiness is that sweet condensed milk you need in order to like these you need to like an underdone cookie because that is what the texture of this is like it is especially with the sweet condensed milk it it gives it that under done texture so if you don't like that at all if you like a crispy completely done cookie you will not want to do this recipe these will be mushy too yes i like the water i like to play with the kui i like the flavor of the chips and i don't necessarily think you get this the um the m m part necessarily no i don't think it's more for just you see them here and there you know throughout the pieces i mean of course you are going to get that candy bar that milk chocolate flavor in there right because i can tell you those chips are dark those truffles those salted caramel truffles those were actually a dark chocolate so any milk chocolate which i get a lot of milk chocolate flavor that you taste that's the m m so you don't necessarily you wouldn't necessarily know that it's eminem but you know that there's milk chocolate in there and i got the little crispy candy coating too yes and i really like the pieces of the uh the like the cookie crust that they got done too that's like firm i it's a good recipe the only thing about these is you couldn't make them to like serve at a party this is not the kind of bars that you're going to be able to lay on a tray for not for a bunch of people that you don't know but now if you were to have this for a dinner for your family and they're going to just like you would a pie you know your family comes in and digs that piece of pie out of a pan this would be fine with that kind of gathering right but this isn't one that you this is not one you put out for your co-workers right because you don't want them digging in a pan of these right exactly but the flavor is very very good it's very i would definitely try this recipe out and you could what's new about it is it's flexible enough where you could change things if you wanted to if you didn't want to get the the salted caramel you could just do regular chocolate chips you could put butterscotch chips in there or milky way or yeah you could chop up a snickers and put on them yeah a kit kat anything and think of all the flavors of kitkats they have now um you could even do uh hershey's kisses as long as you're willing to sit there and break them apart now for me that would be too time consuming well you can get the mini kisses yeah oh yeah you could do that yeah so there's just yes you know what they have the unwrapped candy bars like snickers cats and all kinds of them you can just take those instead of getting a candy bar you could totally get a bag of an unwrapped candy bar yeah yeah the blue minis that's a great pieces yeah yeah so yeah there's a lot you can do with this infinitely variable recipe to stick with the basic like the cookies and stuff but then change like the chips and stuff out whatever sounds good to you and it works really good this is really good this way it is so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "NemJzukvZVA": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying for new bars these are life choice they're simply nutrition bars they were 388 a box at Walmart you do get five bars in each box though I have the dark chocolate nuts and sea salt and the cranberry almond and I have coconut almond and peanut butter dark choc okay let's do let's go straight down yeah hi this one is nothing hidden just simple and delicious and it's gonna again peanut butter with dark chocolate non-gmo gluten-free these are 200 calories per bar so no oh come on yeah no usually well most of the work that I've been hanging ladies lightly or 190 so 200 talking one second show it's a white shirt and this has peanut butter and in chocolate and almond paste and peanuts - yeah good theme graceless is way too tiny for married mmm that's delicious you definitely get the peanuts right away just start playing peanuts then you get peanut butter but then there's the chocolate the chocolate does not take away from the peanuts if you like peanuts I would highly recommend that one and you'll get the good texture what do you think the chocolate is a little got older than bitterest hood but they're pretty good mmm as Lima Steve ahead soya because it has a little bit of that green feel tip enough you want made it look I have to see it in there peanut butter which is roasted peanuts and salt dark chocolate I didn't see it sorry dark chocolate flavored coating yeah cocoa powder so wait yeah it does huh yeah it does have fun but uh Phil yeah you know hi these are here already though I don't know if there's anything to rate you coconut these are to entertain calories it's a fruit this is a fruit and nut bar coconut you like it step out of fruit is that fruit no almonds toast toasted coconut honey yes sticky whatever is no honey the the coconuts the fruit cup um I'm telling you they're concluded Lobby room they're considering the coconut the fruit I just cousin oh you know what has I knew it wasn't a vegetable it would have to be afraid I've just never thought about it I've never is enough I've never given it calm got coconut mm-hmm you know have that much coconut really and they had the coconut flavor burst no no no it's there mm-hmm look say it's cow laughs but it's not that's good this lure like coconut almonds just stuck together with honey it is happy no matter if that has soy in it I don't feel it it does know a little bit but it's way now unless I don't fool without them it's not what I would consider shredded coconut it's like hunks of popping out mm-hmm well very very good hmm if you like coconut I think you'd like that I like that a lot now would you get that again it would be something I eat all the time just because it's 210 calories yeah but flavor was yes well yeah it's a little a little high in calories it's my coconut either love that mm-hmm yeah that's a that would make for a good change honey that's just like eye-opening about your coconut do you it really is you I'm still getting pieces at home yeah and it has a really good joke enough liver and there's a lot of almonds in there a lot you're gonna get almost in every single but you're gonna get more than one in every sense really yes okay this is simply fruit and nut bar this is cranberry almond bursting so this one has almonds sweetened dried cranberries it's thirsty so they're bursting I mean just like ridiculously stings this is gonna be basically the same as the last one except that one had coconut and this one had cranberries this is only 190 calories though this one has the quinoa those little seeds No there's a raw nut in there little boy well I feel like oh I have my mouth is next yeah well I like almonds but that there's like no like I didn't get the cranberry are you preferred all I got was a mouthful of nuts there there is there is a nut in there that's really strong though it there's the macaroons it's a macadamia nuts it's not all kind of different ones there is a raw natural yeah strong flavored it's the macadamia nut I bet you that dip because it's super strong right another rods pretty much the rest of them that right there is the macadamia nut and right there is a macadamia that I've read all the other plum it does macadamia nut and that's our strong so that's all you taste that yeah if he's were absolutely right if if it didn't have the macadamia then if you just had the almonds and the cranberries it would have been a good member yeah it's not bad and if you like macadamia nut you're really gonna like that but don't just don't expect to taste the cranberry because it's telling us cover up no tartness no sweet doesn't matter yeah your liver cranberry bar there are better cranberries flavor gone okay the last one is dark chocolate nuts and sea salt these are 200 calories these have almonds Russia peanuts dark chocolate flavor coating honey walnuts these have walnuts crisp rice heart one augmentation I know I'm just thinking about like Adrienne but it does show a picture of a walnut on the front and so like a nurse praying you still looking for that I'll tell you what there it's full of almonds no let's go mm-hmm doc taco heads a bitterness too though that it doesn't need to have it does but I'll like it I think it's really it's good if you like dark chocolate I mean that's why you're bombing this bar right it's for the dark chocolate and it's off your body if you're buying it then you know what it don't drop but nice like then that's really good I think it delivers on that and I understand the price for these 388 a box because it's full because they're so full of nuts and Ned you're expensive and they really are so getting five bars for 388 um I really think it's worth it no my favorites part of the coconuts and I really liked the flavor the peanut butter but it had it had that grainy texture so if your sense of that if they had it in there the other ones I did not get that grain is run but that first one I did I think they all have it but maybe it was but see all these other ones are fruit and nut bars this one was not this one no but I think they all have the yeah this one has the soy no that's why didn't I get salt on it either you know what I don't know that I'm seeing that soy and the fruit net1 yeah some may not have it well anyway I really like the peanut butter one the flavors I do not see yeah it's but it's a very very last ingredient on those my favorite was the peanut butter yeah the peanut run was really good that second it was the coconut so ours are just turning to random and then I do really like the dark truffle one too so out and the three that I will keep and eat are these and I don't know if I'll keep them this one or not because that macadamia nut is awfully I might keep them and you know just because I don't want to give away 388 I don't know we'll say but these are all winners they really really are William and I'm gonna take a picture have them at the end for you so that you can see how nice they are and once again we found them at Walmart I don't know where else they sell this brand probably everywhere I just don't know so I hope you

won't be able to tasting salt I love the shape of them that's pretty cool who kind of makes you ask like twins it's like one of those pictures that yeah but they're filled or something I know it doesn't look like this so how do you think you're supposed to be a magazine or you think you're supposed to only one of those oh okay so not Phil hmm I got hunka saw double pieces off that's nice of a man three more white chocolate than it does major it's a yes has it seemed texture the same flavors almost is all white truck yes I got the salt mm-hmm there's a mix of salt in it but the for them but I do taste the caramel but for the best part you really are my some white black John it's got the same texture same general flavor is white chocolate so it's an incredibly sweet with that saltiness that white chocolate saltiness and that's really good I like it it's it's a little calmly I wish is a little more chrome on it but I'm not gonna complain too much because it's a really good candy yes it's very good this is the almond brittle milk chocolate rich buttery toffee and roasted almond pieces wrapped in silky smooth milk chocolate so buttery topping almonds milk chocolate show the bottom because it looks like you get plenty of coffee and almonds the top and there's a there's little D's on each piece it has a little dinghy for Doug so that is intended to be your face is this size I immediately go through all of them oh yeah Doug talked about some really good chocolate anyway it's very smooth very creamy very high-quality chocolate who they made Bob Morris Morris there was plenty of toffee pieces in there mm-hmm plenty of toffee pieces plenty of almond the toffee pieces are crunchy ER they're very sweet mm-hmm with it but you know you don't taste the toffee that much I mean you get a little bit of it it's more chocolate no chocolate yeah and the milk chocolate is a very nice smooth mm-hmm but I like that a lot like the combo better but I like that a lot - okay this one's an odd combination from its bourbon vanilla in dark chocolate mm-hmm it says it is premium bourbon vanilla swirl through silky smooth dark so yeah the dark you leave them well it's pretty it's very this is a pretty penny more weight the picture on the front the shout it smells get to confront us all small beyond don't like that is the front shell thing with you yeah but you really can't appreciate it do you see it like that yeah oh good very smooth chocolate I get the Bourbon mm-hmm really strong but all the but then the dark context over towards the end the dark chocolate it has the Chris penis the Chris penis of a regular dark chocolate bar like you would expect it to be a crisp or chocolate I don't know how to love that I like it see I just get a very little vanilla time in the beginning and then it goes why mm-hmm I don't know oh my god I would eat that I would know that wouldn't you really I would if you don't hear your mother like chocolate I like bourbon but I don't I don't know that I like that whole combination this just makes no I would I would do and it's not very pretty game and it's not so dark the words a bitter either no it was a bitter it's something you just don't like that I know yeah I don't know that I can't know that see that doors gonna stand up car coming anyway so there's mostly the dark chocolate so sweet smooth not bitter shop dark walk right by this one is the raspberry rose a it is in dark chocolate it is a sweet pink layer with raspberry and Rose a flavors over smooth silk dark and do you like raspberry I do like raspberry in dark chocolate you know what you get out of a selection box I like that creams yeah I like orange cream and the raspberry cream it's pretty it's like a dusty Dusty Rhodes go on this don't talk on the bottom these are on they're hard to break because they're kind of small like this awkward yeah it is smaller than you would expect they're kind of hard to grab Faysal Seaton's or something on through there good no I like that or not now see you probably love it I don't mind I don't mind it but it's out of the four it's not one that I would pick up I'm going to try another one of the Bourbon I kind of do just to see hmm that raspberry is a very strong berry flavor road doesn't stand out it's very necessary to me it's just buried I mean I could probably have that raspberry flavor but that one I think it's good but I'm not Hughes lover I'm very soft I would I do like raspberry but I still wouldn't choose it it's kind of gummy bear cub raspberry the mini I like a gummy gummy raspberry it's raspberry but it verges on a floral there's something 90% over yeah that's fine that Rosie which is rook yeah I don't care for the floral part of it it's the Rosie's with you yeah I can't think for me both of those honestly the dark childhoods I would leave yeah it is like you're either flower yeah it really is there's something about it that's my lease thing yeah I don't mind it but if you like that flavor you probably pick it but you're the hard to bring out there burn calories she's breaking me home so the rice great smile a sniper honestly I think once the second one doctor coffee the almond brittle with chopping hmm I'm gonna say salted caramel now I'm gonna say the almond brittle is my number one mm-hmm and then I actually like this dark chocolate number two and then the caramel three and the rose a red rose a third for completed with The New Yorker well you're probably gonna go we're down the road no no I'm gonna say almond Burroughs my favorite - yeah it's very good I like the element bro I love the toffee pieces I love the flavor the toffee and the almond and the milk chocolate it's so good but my second one is gonna be the salted yeah and I think I like the darker one just uh just uh in the dark I mean I don't get either one of them yeah even though I do like your chocolate so it's not like I don't like it at all normally do like dark chocolate I just don't care for that soon but if you are interested in any of these at all you should get on oh yeah definitely good quality chocolate even the one we didn't like necessary flavor out of it it's still really good yeah it's still good quality chocolate in a dollar eighty eight it's not bad above you think that you can divide it out into three servings and they're small I mean though these bars break into pieces that big and so if you do that three times you're gonna get a lot of individual little bars of chocolate and it don't last you a little while so I hope this was helpful to you a share well thank you again for letting me know that these were out there to look for them and I will have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "qlGzFA_9MhM": "today heaven 1/8 or not we're going to be trying to four different items from Fannie Mae chocolates these were very expensive because Kevin bought them at his school bookstore they were $3 a bag yeah there are one two three four five there are six milk chocolate cherries in the side six for 300 any one of these are dark chocolate almond to cease all cashews it's over love these are dark chocolate sea salt cashews and they for one packages around $20 these are right in Chicago 1100 for 340 for the entire lives little water you see some cash sea salt I got the salt dug at the door property viola but they're solved in their tab you've been in yet we have plenty more leave a bottle idiot certainly yeah yeah remember Michael all that one's bent though I did buy it all Harris you can see the debt in a picture here you can see one another one you'll make that for your picture now that those are okay I don't really go to Kashi what kill i get the cashews and salt the dark chocolate dr. love yeah I'm really sensing that those are good okay these are dark chocolate almond I am already dark chocolate almonds these are buckled teardrops not nearly as good as attending all right good very good jack and take the almond Heather narcotics I love the level of dark Java I don't know they did a good job it's so good the thing is is once you've had the salt in the cashew oh you miss the salt in the next one you miss the salt in the almonds so braining in on its own though it's good it's hard it's hard to write a nectarine no no it's very very good all the times but honestly I would rather have milk chocolate with almonds and almonds oh and I'm sorry that package of dark chocolate almonds was 340 calories for the pocketbooks now this package of milk chocolate cherries is 300 calories even but that's huge look at that the whole thing I'm about to say wow okay yummy good flavor though I've been mad well there's only like six you don't get many but I tell you what they're huge they're good without my dollars again now I don't get a really strong turbo Bravo I would pay three dollars look I was craving them you know if I'm craving something and I don't want it now I'll take what yeah but do you think those are worth 300 I don't get a cherry flavor form I don't think these are near as good as some of the old boy drama no they're good they sell it and I want I'll get it they we've tried so many public cemeteries that these don't stand up to the other ones it was dr.osman the Cherry Pie was nice job don't know their gun these are espresso baby seat the package is 240 calories probably : oh look I'm gonna guess I'm going to have these this big they'll be hard like crunchy from the reason this recipe number the clock violation oh yeah yeah I love it though oh really balance that is good bubbles bounce people so this was just a big old sack of bitterness for me I just tastes like somebody I think you've actually only got coffee and you're the coffee me million honestly I wouldn't buy any of them again because I've heard think $3 it's too much to pay but if I were to paint $3 I would probably get I would probably get the the sea salt cashew because I could taste the sea salt I could taste the dark chocolate and the flavor of the cashew came out if I had to pick one I really wouldn't buy any of them again though come by no cherries you would get the cherry seven long I like those I really liked I don't like the I really like I like that style cherries better than to affordable because I don't like that explosion of however like one little tubes down like that juice laughs that's good look like a I can't that choose that at my own pace it's not this explosion I have to clean up and then basically happy you don't back long one block right whereas you can Bible only does is they were a good texture and stuff but I don't really get out strong for charity the cherry flavor wasn't strong enough for me either can we take pictures I finished yes you would like the Express of these now do you like these presents for some things today and I better save them because my wife will really personable level but yes I will take a picture of each one of these and have it for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "ZegDMe8Xa7Q": "[Music] okay as we're so excited about a brand new app I want to share a couple of app recipes with you guys over the last couple of weeks so we had the coconut lentil dal and we're I think in that video told you a lot more about it with 400 Publix recipes and yoga videos and meal planners and everything and I want to share sweet recipe with you guys today - these are gooey caramel e blondies so Blondie's basically brownies without the chocolate although we're going to do some chocolate chips and these but you can swap that out for like pieces and that's or something if you don't want to make a chocolaty and then this is the best bit that's like this really amazing sticky caramel sauce that we're going to pour all over and I think you're gonna love it so the Blondie's take literally two minutes to stir together so all we're gonna do is just add ground almond buckwheat flour coconut sugar to a bowl then we're just gonna add almond milk but you could use oat milk as well if you've got a nut allergy then maple syrup a bit of bicarbonate of soda and then I'm gonna stir that all up so it's really nice and smooth and it already looks and feels so caramel like at this point we've got to try the mixture it's heaven and then I'm gonna add some chocolate chips which is just literally I'm just going to break up some dark chocolate or you can add some macadamia nuts or walnuts or whatever you like at this point and then just stir that through and then you're just going to line a baking tray with some parchment paper and then pour the mix in which is pretty satisfying to watch because it does look like heaven and then we're gonna bake it for my 35 to 40 minutes and we want to cook it so obviously it's cooked through but it's still got that kind of really nice fuzziness and then when we take it out we leave it to cool and that helps the final kind of setting process of it so try and be patient so while it's cooking we can just make the sauce and we just together coconut oil maple syrup coconut sugar peanut or almond butter and a pinch of sea salt and that is literally made can use an ice-cream on anything and then we'll pour that over the top so these are super indulgent there's a lot of sweetener in there and it's just there heaven they're definitely a kind of probably quite a treat but when you do make them I think you're going to absolutely love them and then when you get those little bits of chocolate when you're eating it that moment is like heaven on earth so excited to hear what you guys think and you'll find loads more recipes like this on our brand-new delicious the other app [Music] you", "-tqKJE4v-nE": "hello this is chef john from food wishes\ncomm with chocolate bar that's right usually my bark is worse than my bite\nbut not this time and besides biting this bark for your\nown personal pleasure this beautiful and easy to make confection would make a\ngreat edible holiday gift which is we've discussed in the past is a great way to\nshow people we care about them without spending the money that proves it so\nwith that let's go ahead and get started and the first thing we need to figure\nout is exactly what we're gonna add to our chocolate and for this version I'm\ngoing to be going with the following three ingredients and those would be\nsome pistachio nuts and these have been shelled roasted and salted we're also\ngonna go with some of these beautiful dried goji berries which if I'm not\nmistaken are the berry of the goatee tree or shrub or plant I've never seen\none but they're very delicious and very festive looking and it'll last but not\nleast I'm also going to go with some toasted walnuts and then if we want we\ncan also include one optional ingredient and that would be a little sprinkling of\nextra coarse sea salt which i think is a nice touch and then once we have all\nthat stuff decided on we can move on to the most important ingredient our\nchocolate and what I have here are 6 4 ounce bars of dark chocolate that is 70%\ncacao and you could go with a little lower percentage of cacao but I am\nrecommending something between 60 and 70% cacao and I mentioned that mostly\nbecause I really enjoy saying the word cacao and what we need to do before we\ntemper our chocolates is go ahead and chop this into small pieces which is not\nthat hard the most difficult part is not having a\nfile over as you cut and also try not to eat too much as you do it but anyway\nwe're gonna go ahead and chop up a pound and a half a dark chocolate and then\nwe're going to separate it into 1/3 and 2/3 portions because while making this I\nwanted to test out a shortcut method for tempering the chocolate which involves\nus melting 2/3 of the chocolate and then stirring the 1/3 portion into that ok\nthe classic professional way is we melt and heat the chocolate to a very\nspecific temperature and then we cool it down and heat it back up so instead of\nthat I decided to try this sounds too good to be true method to hopefully\nachieve the same results so I'm gonna go ahead and add 2/3 of our chocolate to\nthe bowl and we're just gonna do this by eye\nand like I said we will reserve 1/3 of the chocolate to add later and to melt\nthe chocolate what we'll do is heat up a couple inches water until it just barely\nstarts to simmer and then we'll reduce our heat to low and place a bowl over\nthe top to create what we call in the business a double boiler and by the way\nbe sure your heats on the lowest possible setting and then what we'll do\nis add our 2/3 portion into that and basically stand there and watch it melt\nand we're not going to stir this until we think approximately two-thirds of the\nchocolate is melted all right give or take which for me\nlooked to be about right here although it's hard to see with all that glare and\nwhat we'll do when it reaches that point is give it a stir with our silicone\nspatula and we'll keep it over low heat stirring occasionally until all that\nchocolates melted and the mixture feels hot to the touch okay not super hot like\nhot bathwater okay about a hundred fifteen hundred twenty degrees is good\nso I tested that with my finger and it was hot to the touch and once it does\nreach that point we'll go ahead and add the one-third of the chocolate we\nreserved and we'll give that a quick stir and then just as soon as that's\nbeen stirred in to finish this up what we'll do is remove this from the heat\nset it down on the table and basically let it cool down stirring occasionally\nuntil it's cool to the touch and by then all your chocolate will have melted and\nyou should have a very smooth very shiny bowl of melted chocolate and by the way\nI should have already mentioned the whole idea with temporary in the\nchocolate is so that once it firms back up it keeps a nice firm snappy texture\nand not a soft waxy texture okay when we break a piece of this it should snap\nlike our original borrowed chocolate so I kept stirring and testing with my\nfinger until I thought it had cooled down enough and I probably should let it\ngone farther until it started to thicken up a little bit but I'm sort of\nimpatient plus the Sun was going down so I decided you mind was cool enough and\nproceeded to pour that onto my lined baking sheet and I'm using a silicone\nmat here but parchment paper or plastic wrap will work also but anyway I went\nahead and poured my chocolate on like I said probably a little too soon\nand then what we'll do while this stuff is still wet is sprinkle over our\ntoppings so I started with my walnuts which as you can see I chopped up or I'm\ngonna leave my dried goji berries whole but I did decide to chop up my walnuts\nand pistachios so how much or even if you're gonna chop this stuff is up to\nyou all right that's all gonna depend on the texture and appearance of the\nsurface you're going for so you decide you are after all the Bob Marley of how\nnarrowly to make your bark but as you can see I did chop mine up pretty well\nand besides whether to chop or not you also have to decide how much to put on\nalright some people go for almost completely full coverage but personally\nI do like to see a good amount of chocolate but I was still pretty\ngenerous and then once my fruit nuts were applied I finished up with a light\nsprinkling of our sea salt and that is it all we need to do is let this cool\ndown and harden up which should happen right on the table top but again I was\nworried about my light so I cheated and pop mine in the fridge for a few minutes\nat which point I pulled it out and it looked like this and I have to be honest\nI was a little concerned because it wasn't that shiny so I really wasn't\nsure at this point if that shortcut tempering method worked but as I started\nto break this up it actually felt pretty good and was snapping apart in nice\nclean pieces although it does help that this was cold but later even at room\ntemp it did break up pretty cleanly and if you hold it at the right angle the\nsurface did have a little bit of Sheen to it\nwhich is a good sign so I will deem the shortcut tempering method acceptable but\nhave you said that I'm also going to provide links in the blog post to the\nactual professional temporary method in case you want to use that because\nthat'll produce a bark that comes out even shinier and crisper but anyway I\nwent ahead and finished breaking that up some people like to cut it but I think\nthe irregular broken pieces look much better and way more bark like and that's\nit once that's portioned up we can transfer that into some kind of\nattractive serving vessel and enjoy our fruity nutty chocolate bark which\nobviously can be made with a million different combinations of toppings but\nhave you said that these three work very well especially with that little touch\nof sea salt and as I mentioned the whole point of that tempering step\nso you can snap the chocolate like this okay it's not like it's gonna be\nterrible if it's soft but if you temper the texture is going to be much nicer\nand more like a piece of nice chocolate versus a piece of cheap chocolate so let\nme go ahead and try one more piece before I move along and remind you what\na great edible gift this would make presented in some type of festive\ncontainer preferably with a bow and that my friends would make one very nice\nedible gift and remember what we say when it comes to giving edible gifts\nwe're not cheap we're creative but anyway that's it a holiday themed\nchocolate bark like I said I wanted to try that shortcut tempering method which\ndid work out pretty good but like I said in the blog post I will\nprovide links to show you how to do for real but either way professional method\nor shortcut whether you're making this for yourself or for a gift or both I\nreally do hope you give this a try soon so head over to food wishes calm for all\nthe ingredient amounts or more info as usual and as always enjoy", "fFUTxy7yyVI": "today Kevin a Nader and I are going to be trying for new to us items these are choco love is the brand Sarah sends us these from California and we've seen the choco love bars but we've never seen them in a box like this these are the honey roasted almonds yeah honey roasted peanuts in a nature chocolate bars salted almond butter in dark chocolate and we have chiles and cherries you know our chocolate yeah so we're gonna dry your honey roasted peanuts milk chocolate covered honey roasted peanuts that's waiting hey Jerome a vulvar Colorado a third of the box is 150 calories and there's about three servings in the box it doesn't sound like there's a plastic bag and it's the same calories for this one as well hundred fifty pounds which is what we're used to is seeing another packages out of the package yeah these are their plastic bags I want the big one okay so these are things you look it tastes like chocolate or peanut the chocolate kind of kills it I'm gonna be honest I hate to think that I used to eat chocolate covered peanut years ago and when Kevin over first married and they were the Brock's brand I like yeah I like the Brock's brand of chocolate covered peanuts better for their party they were probably a lot cheaper have you ever had the Bronx Brandon laughs probably not and there they were bigger I know is that's not honey roasted no I don't taste the honey would you say honey would you get that crispy coating good night yeah that just tastes like chocolate peanuts yeah yeah tastes like this they duper though and these were probably expensive so yeah there's a little bit better play than I do oh these are honey roasted almonds oh sorry that's not an almond yeah there you go yeah trying to escape price drop a chocolate or something immediately takes the on these are the mousetrap yeah I get that crunchy layer that you were talking about with this one will that take some honey roasted although I get it you do taste it in these yeah got a little more crunch stuff these are awesome those those are banging are definitely different so if you have a choice if you can choose between the peanuts and almost I would definitely go to the elements now the almonds are good that getting elements I'm absolutely with later puncture on them now these what is this one oh this it would be your salted almonds better in our culture it's pretty good okay this is a third of the bar there's there's three servings in ones are so you do pay more for these I know they're more expensive but you're supposed to get the reserves out of them they are 160 calories for a third of the bar pretty good sized pieces though and there is an actual poem in here how many do you get it's you ever you would have to write it a third of the bar is 30 grams is yo they didn't even divide it up in there no no City Council yeah if you wanted to share it with three people you wouldn't be able to can you just throw in then you get the board fingers you bought the bar fight it 1/2 a kilo can you give my thing each person gets three bases and you lose a nice one because you bought the ball I get the salt times it's a little grain of salt in them mm-hmm the doctor it's pretty dark for me though I think it's very very good but it's not something I would got all the time because I it's a little bitter you probably love it don't you I got the salt room in order for it to be you got the salt money in order for you know the average Joe to be able to taste you salt and almond butter no you can't put that my stock chocolate it yeah it's pretty strong girl oh yeah you taste the chocolate and you taste the salt I didn't get the almond butter yeah nobody nobody got the texture though you're right not even me I didn't get the better either let me actors now look how this one of them okay you'd open right up I had that and wrap the other one children cheering this is children up cherry okay and ain't no what about the calories on this one this one also has a a poem inside of it you can and a third of the bar is 140 so this is you get six squares so harder this was very cute nice the joy I know the spice will hate you there's definitely spices in there Jimmy I think it it's very spicy all night you didn't get any did you because I didn't either you didn't get any spiciness she got the juice shake it up girls feel like we know oh face was a spy there's a little that mean no not so minor that I don't even call it this I feel there it's like it's like you've looked some pepper I got cherry and I like spice in the nature I can barely get any one thing I thought chopped up to them the cherry for me was all of them a texture hot spiciness oh yeah that was I don't really want to eat it I know but I'm curious because I didn't get it yes I got that dark chocolate kind of arrived everything I'm wondering if I got like a middle pieces of carrying them out yeah a little to each area but it tasted right it's all texture it's not like there's any tasted too serious oh thanks chair you got besides I got the hate and what anything that's got dr. Hahn's I didn't get some cherry so maybe it's just depends on what you think it depends how much fish again so think so you're gonna have to you know but that's that it's a good bar but it's a little dark for me alright this stuff out yeah the honeyrose columns is the best thing yeah I think that's for good - it's just just you can get those anywhere yeah you could get probably a cheaper brand of that was that so Sarah thank you very very much for sending these to us and I hope one else enjoyed the video I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "lMjyT2a8_pk": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to new bars for you these are both from Nature Valley Kevin love's Nature Valley bars anyway so we saw these on the shelf at Meijer and we thought we'd try them out they were 319 H and that is a little I thought 319 was expensive anyway really experiment then what I got home I looked closer at the box yeah there's only four bars in this box down for now if there is this much room they could have easily fit a fifth bar in the box so unless these are really really really good we probably won't bomb again just because they're really expensive I mean if Kevin liked them of course we've got them again but there's so many bars to choose from these days that I don't have to pay 319 for our box of bars and some nature Ellie they need to lower the price on these whoever is in charge of that okay I have almond cashew and sea salt I have roasted peanut and honey okay it says a simple nut bar almond cashew and sea salt made of net seeds honey tapioca syrup and sea salt if they're gluten free not exactly the same thing good free no high fructose corn syrup a header 80 calories nuts and seeds from nature it's that simple and delicious they a hurry so was everything then thank my even says the same thing at the bottom may have nut seeds honey tapioca syrup and sea salt okay let's look at the ingredients roasted almonds roasted peanuts where's the compassion roasted only mine does no cashews okay honey tapioca syrup go roasted sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds - that is concedes and my cease my copy okay sir but basically the same little the nuts are different different so these are gluten-free which is good their box let me get both I might have to do so yeah there's the two we can kind of see the difference between the two one of them looks like it has that one yours doesn't look like it has them hey that's like this one does look sticky it is a little bit sticky and you're not crazy about pumpkin seeds okay I'm trying to take it all out I should have lunch at the baggage but I try to take it out so you can see it's a little chewy that's a big pumpkin seeds yeah you would take a bite out at the other end cuz this fan has a Wanda that's not bad you can taste stuff and again the pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds whatever they haven't even really taste those absolutely that overrides the taste to me I can take this occasion to catch you to you that's amazing because so you can't taste the caffeine out you say that that's what the flavor is it's casual and she's a very specific nut taste and there's so many things that say they have cashews them and I never taste on that you can taste that thank you and now that I think about it I know I write about the price cashews are expensive if you buy a can of cashews from hunters or even the cheap kind they're expensive and this has almonds and cashews boom it's no wonder they charge ya personally don't care for that bar that much but I mean it's okay it's a little too nutty you have to like cashews because that point were so distinct it's very strong if you don't like it you're not going like that here's the next one look at the bottom it looks like it's a caramel or something soon that's the honey okay so yours is roasted nut and honey run roasted peanut peanut mm-hmm sweet combo those peanut flavor really comes out of it does if you yeah if you like peanuts that's a really strong peanut my word and I probably like it too better to just for the I guess the honey it's a it's not like wow that's sweet like a candy bar but it's just a little enough sweetness in there to make you feel like you're you're getting you know a little dessert a little treat in there I'm missing the salt part of it though cuz we've tried other things recently that that were bars that were salty the had is salty not only do these don't taste like salty you know it says sea salt there we know I don't taste it no no I don't this one said say something mom did this one has sea salt in it okay yeah but I didn't I see something one of them you're right they're both good they're both good bars but they're way too expensive they're way too expensive there were 319 it more Meyer now they might be cheaper at Walmart because I've noticed Meyer Meyer I pay a lot more at Meyer than I do at Walmart for certain items certain items were cheaper certain lows are more expensive like Entenmann's doughnuts for example I made the mistake of buying a box of those admire I paid almost $1 more for those at Meijer than I pay at Walmart which is just crazy but I didn't know I didn't realize that so anyway these might be a lot of cheaper at Walmart so check and see because they really are they do have a good very good flavors if you like cashew not a lot of bars have that good cashew flavor you're gonna get it unless there's no that you're only getting four ripped off you know so anyway hope you enjoyed getting to see them and thanks for

[Applause] mmm-hmm why travel with whole almonds and Harbaugh's almond pieces mostly though there's so many almonds in there you can't hardly taste the vanilla of the white chocolate I mean you can build a lot it's overwhelming with almond flour mm-hmm it's really good though they're white chocolate it's phenomenal any one is good I love that though I don't know I love the added flavor and texture that the almonds give them with the white chocolate itself is one of the best white chocolates man it really is excellent quality white chocolate very incredibly sweet that's delicious yeah okay this one's a 34 percent hazelnut milk chocolate hazelnut the comas almond pieces I don't know watch widows decided he wants to pace back and forth behind but he is he's okay yeah she's just fun to walk around laxatives we have to put these in a ziplock baggie anyway so you just have to tear up the package there are at least that's how we keep them fresh I'm sure a lot of people just fold over the papers oh my goodness I'm saving time that's amazing I'll say that they say that golf already something whole hazelnuts this Brooke right yes so that's 200 our 107 yes had enough mm-hmm it's a completely new profiler oh yeah telling it good but uh the strong flavor of the nuts mm-hmm takes over just like it is the almonds hazelnuts really take out although you get that chocolate play with this one a little stronger because the milk chocolate I guess it's really good yeah it has a very creamy milk chocolate flavor mm-hmm the hazelnut is very strong I don't like it but I think a lot of I think a lot of Americans probably aren't used to hazelnut in things and so I think some Americans might find that really really strong too strong oh yeah I like it too and they give you so many I don't know how much I'm gonna pay for these but I I just know they give you a lot you know like at this moment there's not many meaning ingredients that one has more marine so this one does but this one Roy doesn't have much as far as working green it's got yeah I like that it says it may contain three guys this was 34% hazelnuts it's dark talking with hazelnuts and caramelized hazelnut pieces this one had coma almonds I don't think I got almonds oh I didn't know it taste them I'm glad you mentioned that because I only to taste the hazelnut hazelnuts are so strong and that really if they could have not had the almond pieces in there at all I don't know would have made a difference I don't have to miss them maybe one half target to sort things out right exactly yeah these the ingredients are very it's a very short list just like with the white chocolate it says almonds sugar cocoa butter milk skim milk soy it's an emulsifier and artificial flavor I mean that's it very pure ingredients this is the dark chocolate yeah there's a little darker still just as me Haven us so this is hazelnut and hazelnut fevers and calorie wise it is two pieces 160 it's full like our Philly not again but it's all this whole nuts it's solid hazelnuts anytime you add a nut here it's gonna make it more calories hmm elements good to don't try to sell my favorite but it's still good for a dark problem in that bite I got a little bit of a like a crystallized sugar yeah I did homage I don't know that I really got but in that one idea the pieces back that one was probably my least favorite just because it is in dark chocolate and I prefer first white and then milk you're really young yeah oh yeah all the white chocolate ones dead on the fiber I love it I just love the white the white in general I wonder what I don't have my eyes on that in why mm-hmm I guess uh it probably is I like the dark chocolate as well there's nothing wrong with it of course but yeah they have good dog sorry there there is enough though to know enough to know that your it's not milk chocolate it's not a horse bitterness all right right and salad big milk white a minute darling not okay well that's okay because then you can leave it no no my target was almost Oh would you take me yes I I just think it's absolutely delicious so I am going to have a picture for you all at the end Mona thank you so much for sending these to us and thanks for watching [Music]", "wrxn0-FtBfI": "oh the cookies c18 take one I'm Alison Roman and I am making a salted butter chocolate chunk shortbread cookie also known to some of you as the cookies you gave it that name not me so this is a recipe that originally appeared in my first cookbook dining in the reason I think that it's achieved the success that it has because it is familiar it does have elements of a chocolate chip cookie and elements of a classic shortbread cookie and when the two combines you get the cookie anytime I'm baking anything I like to have all of my ingredients measured first before I start mixing because what can happen is you get to the bottom of the recipe and you realize that the egg that I call for doesn't actually go into the cookie as it goes on the outside and the flaky salt that I call for goes on top not in the dough and I just really gets nice to see everything read the recipe know exactly what you're getting yourself into before proceeding I've never baked anything by the way without getting flour absolutely everywhere and oliver myself and my loved ones and my kitchen and it's just you know whatever will vacuumed I do think that's the most accurate way to measure things especially flower is with a scale every time I weigh a cup of flour it weighs almost exactly 145 grams oh my god 144 grams baby yes I'm in a competition with myself and I won let's see if we can do it again 148 little heavy a little heavy that's fine I feel like as long as you are within like 4 or 5 grams on either side it's not gonna make a huge difference moral the story use the scale if you can now comes our sugar which sugar almost will always weigh the same so quarter cup for me is probably 1/4 cup for you the way that it settles in the cup there's not as much discrepancy so I wouldn't worry too much about that a good thing to know is that this dough freezes really well the recipe can easily be doubled have some for now and have some for later so our basic ingredients are here and accounted for we have salted butter as the name would imply our chocolate and I really like having a lot of different textures of chocolate in this cookie but you know this is like as about as big as I would go I feel like making these cookies for us right now is kind of like a video game where like each level is a new hurdle or a situation so this is butter this is stage 1 actually no measuring shopping is stage 1 because you need to buy the right ingredients measuring is level 2 and now we're at level 3 mixing the dough starting with the butter I like starting with cold butter because you beat it for an eternity I want people to really go for it this is not a suggestion I'm not hinting at maybe combine the butter and sugar together I want you to cream it I want it to be fluffy I want it to be light I wanted to almost look like frosting and it's not because I'm trying to waste your time it's because you're really relying on this air which is also what gives it that like when you bite into it it feels somehow light and fluffy almost like a puff pastry it should be very flaky beating the air into it at this stage is what's gonna get you there so I'm gonna scrape down everything to kind of make sure that all the butter at the bottom is getting mixed with all of the sugar all right our butter and sugar is pretty much there can see in this bowl it already looks like there's more stuff in there and now I'm going to add my flour [Music] you basically want to mix it until the dough comes together to give it a few turns I want you to look at this dough I always tell people that it should resemble play-doh it shouldn't be dry it shouldn't be crumbly it should look you know like cookie dough now you've all used to be able to like make a log cabin with I don't know what he do with play-doh anyone who's ever tried to wrap anything in plastic wrap you know that it is nothing but heartbreak and from here we're gonna shape it into logs and you kind of you know it doesn't have to be perfect it just looks like a blob so this is decidedly more square than round but the round happenes now you just kind of roll it and your cute little large Oh God where will they go don't look at me look in here oh my god I should have thought about that before ah what a nightmare who lives here doesn't bear Seng uh anyway in they go thank you good night the cookies are taking a little nap in the fridge they're gonna be there for at least two hours don't look in here get out of there okay it's doesn't look better than the last time we went in so I forget what level we're at in that crazy metaphor that I brought up earlier but um is the second to last level we're gonna roll it in egg wash and like you're mixing paint or something or feeding an egg I'm sure something that you do more often than mix paint I like to put this sugar in a like a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet or something like that just like your breading a chicken cutlet or something my analogy is today are really something else so really you're just kind of looking for a nice thin layer which is why I like using a brush just kind of paint the outside and then you can kind of just roll the cookies like this once I seen these cookies I go about a half inch thick sometimes even when I'm cutting them the dough will crumble a little bit and that's okay because you can kind of piece it together if it's pretty forgiving this is probably the most common thing that will happen to my cookies when you get to like a large chunk but I literally just put it back together Oh Humpty Dumpty situation we all know that one yeah they can go definitely closer together these cookies will not spread so to finish they're gonna get a sprinkling of salt and you're not gonna use kosher salt you're gonna use a nice coarse flaky salt and now they go in the oven it's been about 11 12 minutes and our cookies are ready to be taken out of the oven so you can tell they're ready because they are golden brown around the edges they're still pretty pale in the center but they're crispy they smell amazing and I think they look pretty perfect little babies go ahead and transfer them to you know one by one to a wire rack or if I had more parchment kind of letting them cool here these are the kind of cookies that are truly better at room temp they are not like a chocolate-chip cookie where you want to eat them warm put an extremely fun plate of cookies and my favorite one is gonna go on top there there are cookies our cookies the cookies cookie salted butter chocolate chunk shortbread cookie and now comes the moment we've all been waiting for so they should be crunchy they should be crispy that texture in there that is like kind of almost like laminate II it's like flaky and but still dense is exactly what we're looking for mmm I think my favorite part about them is that to me to the best of every world like they have that vanilla and brown sugar and like crispy edge business that a chocolate chip cookie does and they've got the dense buttery flakiness that a shortbread does so to me it is like absolutely the perfect cookie hmm they're really good you guys they're really good for the recipe and a lot more you can check out New York Times cooking [Music]", "-8zdRgEfFfo": "hi guys welcome to my channel today I'm going to show you how to make keto chocolate and not bark it is very easy to make and also super delicious so before getting into the video if you are new to my channel make sure you subscribe and also hit the notification bell so that you get all the updates whenever I post a new video so here I have taken 1/4 cup of almonds 1/4 cup of cashews 1/4 cup of pistachios and 1/2 cup of walnuts I have taken raw nuts but you can also roast them and also you can take any nuts of your choice I'm going to chop these nuts using the chopper into small pieces you can also chop the nuts by using a knife or simply crush them as you can see the nuts are chopped very well so I am going to do this for all of the nuts so the chopped nuts are ready so for chocolate you have two options first one is to use 100% unsweetened chocolate and you can sweeten this chocolate by using any sweetener of your choice the second option is to use pre sweetened chocalate chips so these chocolate chips are sweetened by erythritol and stevia so for this recipe today I am going to use the chocolate chips so here I have taken 4.5 ounces of chocolate chips and I am going to melt these in the microwave if you don't have a microwave you can also mail these chocolate chips by using double boiler method before you melt the chocolate take a greased plate or a plate lined with greased parchment paper so after the chocolate has melted I have added a tablespoon of ghee you can also add coconut oil or butter this gives a nice shine to the chocolate so now I add the nuts and mix very well everything is mixed very well now spread this onto the greased parchment paper instead of making into a bark you can also make this interest all bite-sized nut clusters spread the mixture quickly and as thinly as possible now I am sprinkling some sea salt on top you can also use salt flakes salt enhances the taste of chocolate so put the plate into the fridge now for 30 to 40 minutes until it gets solid so after 40 minutes our chocolate and nut bark is ready break them into bite-sized pieces I hope you enjoyed this recipe let me know in the comments below and also like this video and don't forget to subscribe to my channel I will see you again with a new video thanks for watching bye", "4Xvbqxv8DTg": "hey everyone I'm getting ready to make a new batch of soap tonight I'm gonna be testing out indigo fragrance crazy coconut now I normally use their zesty wine but I ran out and I thought I had more but I don't so I'm using some old fragrance oil that I have from nature's garden lime cilantro it actually still smells good I don't think it's that old but tonight I'm making lime coconut salt bars I have my like cooling down and I had my oils cooling down and I went ahead and added the full fragrant full 1 ounce of crazy coconut and 2 full ounces of lime cilantro to my salt that way it's already incorporated into the salt and the if the fragrance oils were going to accelerate trace on me or rice or anything it limits that especially when you're making a salt bar so we're still going to make sure that it doesn't race that the color holds up that the senton holds up and it doesn't accelerate my trace but I just wanted to add it to the salt so that way it when I incorporate it into my mixture there's no added surprises because I really want a nice salt bar so I'm just going to go ahead and continue with the process I'll set up my little stand and we will do my continuous video that I've been trying to do lately so just give me a couple minutes again we're testing out crazy coconut tonight and I added lime cilantro so I can do a coconut lime salt bar all right so we'll be back all right so I have my oils cooled down and I have my leg cooled down to room temperature I'm going to share my recipe for this salt bar I made it up myself and I will put it in the comment section below so that way if you guys want to try and can I added Kaelyn clay to my oils I added tussah soap to my lye water that's going to hopefully help for better lather because I am using let me see my recipe is saying I'm using almost 60% coconut oil in this recipe so I want to make sure that it's not harsh on the skin so I'm going to go ahead and mix my line now as I mentioned in previous videos you won't see me using gloves I do know the rest the reason I don't wear gloves is because my hands tend to become very numb and I don't want to risk dropping my stick blender and making a bigger mess so I just work extremely carefully and you know the rest involved you guys use your safety precautions as you do or you feel necessary so I'm going to go ahead and mix my lye into my soap batter you know this is my first time ever making a salt bar and my first time using crazy coconut so we're doing some first this evening so I don't want to mix this to a heavy trace I wanted to just set a very light trace so I'm going to go ahead and mix this up you might want to turn down your volume because it does get a little loud I'm just gonna bring this to a white light crease I want it somewhat horrible for the salt the salt is going to make it move really fast it's really important you don't over mix so that's why I'm not totally using the stick blender the whole time I'll sit there and stir it a little bit I just want to make sure I'm doing a Micha green so you can see that I'm going to split it up bringing color here and again you might want to turn down your volume I just have to stick this all right so you want to make sure your mold is ready i'm using a individual 12 bar silicone mold that I got from bramble berry the reason I'm using silicone and individual molds is because salt bar is hard enough really really quickly and if you don't catch it in time it's going to be too hard to cut you get crumbly edges and what silicone does is it helps keep the edges nice and what the individual bars do it avoids you having to cut them yourself so I'm going to use my 12 bar silicone mold like I said I added one ounce of crazy coconut by indigo fragrance and two ounces of lime cilantro that I have by nature's garden into my sea salt already I am using 75% sea salt for my mixture again I'll share the recipe and put it at the bottom of the comments with the explanation I'm going to go ahead and divide it equally into each portion of soap here and the reason I put the fragrance oil in the salt was so that wanted to be evenly distributed into if there was any surprises everything is already incorporated and I can move quickly thicker wool probably wasn't the best idea to have that in the little container there make sure it's all incorporated all right so I'm going to go ahead and pour this all into the bowl actually you know what I'm gonna give it in the pot swirl alright now I have my gold already and we're just gonna go ahead and fill it it smells really good and there was no racing I'm glad I took the tip from the videos I saw I'm adding the fragrance oil to my back to my salt prior to adding it to the batter so there's no rising the scent is holding up beautifully it did not accelerate trace there is no seizing of this batch and the colors are holding up really nice it's gonna be a really light green and white bar I hope it turns out well we shall see at the end now I do have another mold ready cuz it looks like I probably made a lot here so I have an into a log mold ready just to pour my extras in and since I'm putting it in this vlog mold I'm really gonna have to watch it is this one I'm going to have to cut individually I might use these as sample bars don't want to waste any of this good stuff all right now I still have to bang them down but here it is in the individual mold and there it is in my little loaf mold again everything held up beautifully and we're gonna put this aside for 24 hours I'm actually I'll watch the loaf mold that might get cut waste a lot sooner so I'll let you guys know in the cutting video how long it actually took but look for the description on the bottom and I'll share this recipe with y'all thanks for watching everyone so here my salt bars all finished I started them at 9 o'clock last night it's now 6:15 in the morning and they are rock-hard like I would not be able to slice my cutter through here but as you remember I used my individual silicone mold and oh sorry and as you can see no crumbles I'm really happy with the way it came out this scent is incredible it didn't discolor my soap it didn't trace myself it didn't set up my soap or accelerate trace and it didn't seize my back so these are the finished bars I'm going to let them cure for four to six weeks and then we'll be able to use them just also look at the bottom of the comments for the recipe I'll share with everybody exactly what I used and how much I used of it and then if you guys would let me know how yours came out alright thanks for watching", "D5v_whs8lEo": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to five different Fannie Mae milk chocolate bars I have the mint and almond and peanut butter for two dollars each ridiculous Kevin bought them and his school bookstore but it's owned by Barnes and Noble now I've never actually seen these souls and our local Barnes & Noble so I guess that's just something that some college bookstores get but $2.00 just really have to do if you did and you could go back into our other vending machine oh yeah 280 calories for the entire bar for the regular milk chocolate okay 280 so not low-calorie either let's see where these are made these are made in Chicago Illinois their website is Fanny ethane in and I eat May ma why.com doing this bike sure Keith around it it's a crisp chocolate as if it's a dark chocolate no no it's okay but gun bullying feel tough these that come up a slick Olli can't open it's very oily and I don't think there's a lot of them yeah it's not like there's no depth do it at all that's like a cheap chocolate yeah really without the it's smooth I do have to say it's smooth it doesn't like burn your throat or something like some really cheap chocolates but and it has that crispness like dark events mistakes like crap on the dark chocolate well that's not what you all know there's literally no depth there's no silky miss there's no rich chocolate eNOS there's nothing like that nothing like that I don't like to feel that it is this one's 260 it's the calm one so this makes me wonder is it gonna be the lizard okay good so there it is what's the same thing as the other one but they filled each section with pearls so it will be you ready yeah yes it's a runny column these gay bars all up designed up to the bar did you get that I guess I didn't I must have not gotten enough caramel to judge it or something it's not strong at all yeah thick hollow flavoring just barely taste yeah I didn't get any I didn't get a really horrible flytrap I'm weird come in uh look like you're your domain versus kissed at dirtiness oh yeah look like we're everything oh yeah but you're thinking a tip of this yeah this is like you've gone to the Dollar Tree my night job which is horrible since we pay $10 for what you've seen here now ridiculous okay this one was 280 it's the peanut butter keep it on and I'm helping to save some of you because I have seen miss Fannie Mae brand that sold in Walgreens I've seen it sold in the Christmas candy at Tuesday morning I've seen the little packages of Fannie Mae baby people to save you dollars so far [Music] do you just be enough hmm I got a slight little peanut there yes very very little yeah I mean it's got a bunch of stuff in there it's got a bunch of filling but doesn't have a lot flavor I mean literally no floor yeah trying to just see if you get something inside just to be about it's uh when I first ate it it was like almost like you've licked a peanut shell right everybody goes what and yeah it's not salty at all I don't shout about it like that that peanut shell taste the cookie tastes lie but it's a lie it's like you might have thought you liked it be really good yeah it goes away yeah and this is the almond these have all been the same I'm ready to find one wing like so I run on 80 calories and the last ones mint so you think it's nice the minute the phone who is my favorite thing oh there they all put their glasses down and say we can do this too plus I can't see far away you can taste the olive Oh Mike oh gee you have to work really hard to remove the flavor from it [Music] they did this one the right way because what they did was you know her she's put a few random almonds throughout the bar this one they knew they were trouble it didn't have any flavor they knew they would have to do something so they chopped those nuts up and they literally have finely chopped almonds throughout the entire bar I mean it is mostly a French more it is chock full of almonds yeah and you can taste the almonds but then again it's not paired with a good chop chop like so there's bones yeah and it's almost like there's not enough sweetness there even to make it chocolate you know Charles it's supposed to have some sweetness to it that I'm just not impressed know the Charlotte kind of wall all right cookie and this one is 260 we've all been right around 260 280 around there oh it's a good this is good oh it's a mint cookie oh okay I submit its mint cookie this no it is dark chocolate well what that's the big we're all milk Chapa that monster I've completely read that wrong you did give me half now dark chocolate mint cookie you get the crunch of cookie that one you get a minute there's a lot better than the animals it's bad with chocolate still it's kind of sucking yeah it still is that like we've had some really good dark chocolate mint bars really good ones and creamy usually they're really creamy and they still have that holy to the you'd be better off giving an Andes mint or something like that yeah I'm eat these all this all the bases yeah so don't feel any of these if you see them in the bookstore or wherever you may see in them even for a dollar the dollar no oh no they wouldn't be large you're better off getting that for fees or on any other day tomorrow so I think people are saying probably the packaging yes it's nice packaging and they're seeing the price tag until they think oh this is fine

i'll probably pronounce uh mispronounce the name it's okay uh leaf or leaf uh these are from scotland and we've not tried this uh brand before so i have the milk chocolate scottish sea salt and the dark chocolate scottish sea salt and i have a completely different direction and went with gin and tonic these we found these at home goods they were 299 a bar um it says the port of leith once the gateway to scotland the port of leith has proud history built on trading shipyards and the perseverance of its people more recently the neighborhood has become a creative hub the resurgent port is brimming with artisan makers creating goods that are exported all over the world and so i'm assuming they're talking about this chocolate too it says we source our chocolate from south america and create wealth by beginning the chocolate making process at origin this means more wealth remains within developing economies the product is then shipped to scotland where our chocolatiers transform it into indulgent chocolate bars so the origin of the chocolate is columbia so so that's a that's a scottish port no wonder it's we can't pronounce it right yeah oh yeah that's what yeah i mean it's not just a made-up name it's actually no place it's gone yeah it's not made up no okay so what is this gonna look like okay it has no name on it whatsoever it's just stamped i like the smaller bars though the smaller squares i like when they're smaller of course if you can get to break them on the left you have to break them correctly actually it's a little snapped like a dark chocolate this is just the milk chocolate sea salt [Applause] there are no calories anywhere on here it gives the ingredients but absolutely no calorie no uh so maybe you could go uh to their website although there's no website so you would just have to do a search for leaf chocolate uh and see what comes up because there's there's no additional information on here it's a good chocolate it's it's not awesome chocolate i don't i don't taste the sea salt i don't get any sea salt and truth be totally the chocolate flavor is kind of it just tastes like just milk chocolate there it's there's nothing bad about it but there's nothing terrific about it it is lacking uh the creaminess yeah it's like a milka bar would have don't yeah it doesn't have a creaminess to it it's just your run-of-the-mill milk chocolate nothing wrong with it but nothing fancy either so this is gonna be the uh same thing it's supposed to be sea salt but it's in dark chocolate now i literally didn't get any seasoning no there we go it could be more of a snap than them [Music] 61 coco the milk chocolate was 40. yeah the dark color is not a dark dark dark chocolate no but you can definitely tell it starts out it's different yeah yeah it is uh it's on the darker side it dries your mouth out just slightly like it's just starting to dry my mouth out um [Music] it it wouldn't be my choice but i wouldn't choose a dark chocolate but i think they did a good job with it but um once again i do not take any sea salt at all you know that one i got just a hint of salt but not not enough to say it's really yeah i didn't at all when you say something has sea salt you expect to actually like get a hit of fallen yes or have some even if you don't taste it uh during uh then even after when you're getting it out of your teeth once you've swallowed it i absolutely love that and uh there's no hunks of salt there's no no none uh this is the gin and tonic and it is in dark chocolate it seems much thinner is it not it definitely has a different flavor it has a lemon oil and lime oil no sugar i thought it detected a little bit of llama yeah it's funny the lime you taste the lemon and the lime yeah lemon had hit me up but the lime did yeah that's what it tastes like and it also has vanilla extract but i don't taste the vanilla um that one actually flavor wise has the most flavor um yes but i would only i would only buy if i was going to buy one of these the milk chocolate yeah me too and even then i think for the price i think i would skip it i hate to say that but no i would too uh it was cheaper i might get it but but not for whatever three dollars yeah it's not worth three dollars yeah for three dollars a bar there are so many uh bars um and i just i didn't even realize just if you go to walmart and you start picking up one of each of just candy bars that we have available to us you will be absolutely amazed at how many candy bars we have um but i mean even here you bought the world market right no i bought it at homegoods at home goods yeah they well they've got some good chocolates too that's because if you bought it at world market there's better candy bars at all there's better candy bars than i'm good i just think there's but it's just this is just there's nothing wrong with it it's not bad at all it's just yeah it for for what you're paying it's too much for just it to be so plain yeah i mean i don't have any sea salt at all i'd rather go to uh somewhere and buy a milk a bar for four dollars for basically the same size candy bar if not quicker and have such a high quality of candy exactly so exactly so we would just truth be tell we would just pass on yeah so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] foreign", "ynCBp7CZaNQ": "greetings youtubers and welcome to the gearbench as many of you are aware parts of the hiker food chart are becoming outdated apparently some manufacturers like to tinker with their food labels and thanks to everyone that's pointed out discrepancies i have been keeping notes so what started out as spot correcting those updates turned into a mini overhaul in the future i won't do a video every time just know that these foods do change so if you spot something drop a comment periodically i'll just push out stealth updates when i can in this video i'll just highlight some of the significant changes but also many of you have commented with new suggestions stuff that wasn't on the list that is noteworthy and i've kept track of those suggestions as well so i'll highlight those and give credit where it's due the same thing is true for the freeze-dried foods chart except that didn't just get tweaked it got completely renovated and no need to go line by line and all that but i'll explain the upgraded data and some new additions also by suggestion i created a menu planner tool and then added a food combo calculator and then last but certainly not least jeff blum has taken the whole thing to a new level by combining the charts and adding novel features now if you're like just give me the chart and leave me alone well the download link is in the description box below viacom carbs otherwise don't touch that dial and by the way if you have no idea what i'm talking about with all this food chart stuff i did a series of videos explaining it all in detail i'll link those below in case you're interested the chart is now well over a thousand hiker food options there's also a series of nutritional analysis columns for everything from calorie density to macro nutrient performance settings and those are the ones that may need some explanation okay onward to the data judging by the comments coming in most of the attention centers around the lighter foods and unfortunately some of those i featured previously have had their calories reduced for the same serving size and that obviously lowers the density looking at the old top 30 bars by calories per ounce the ultralight rated umpc bars have lost 30 calories each and that drops them to very light status closer to what kind bars used to be and i say used to be because kind bars have also had their calories nerfed whereas previously they were mostly very light now only three flavors remain in that rank the rest are now either lightweight or moderate i went ahead and checked the cliff bars too but there were only minor changes there others expressed disappointment that one of their favorites pro bars didn't rank higher in density than they did and on the one hand i've always said to eat what you like this data is a tool not a rule realizing that food label changes aren't that uncommon i reviewed the pro bars collection in addition to adding more flavors they were the first i discovered to actually have their calories increased they didn't change them a lot but there are now nine flavors rated lightweight also i should point out that when i first made the chart it was just a list for calorie density over time it evolved into more than that with the nutritional columns coming on one at a time and some people have reacted negatively to what they perceive as an undue obsession with ultralight food well the whole point of including the nutritional data and the analysis columns alongside the density is to facilitate people striking their own balance between performance and weight a pro bar that's only lightweight but has an optimum fuel ratio might be worth more to some than an ultralight option with heavily imbalanced macros and as i've said it's entirely up to you looking around at some of the other options that used to appear in the top 30 i found that power crunch bars not only added flavors but they're another example of a density increase where they used to top out at very light there are now 11 options in the ultralight shade now you can get things like red velvet and lemon meringue in 156 calories per ounce that's a particularly good density for a protein specific bar the new pro level power crunch is the same thing it's just in a 330 calorie size with 20 grams of protein instead of 13. you also caught the fact that the old trapper beef sticks got put on a diet they used to be the top of the meat section but lost 30 calories per serving going from very light to only moderate in exchange though i found the alberto smoked sausage sticks got an increase and they're not only number one now but they rate as ultralight which is even better than the old trapper sticks used to be and then for nutrition's sake i expanded the flavors of cookies by lenny and larry true they're mostly heavy with a few moderates but look at the carb protein ratios every flavor is in the range for optimal fuel i really like them for day hikes or any other circumstance where weight may not be that critical they're soft they taste good and it's 400 calories and 16 grams of protein that fits flat in your pocket by showing the various flavors for these or for any other food you can really fine tune your selections you want the lightest get snickerdoodles trying to limit sodium chocolate chip it's all just data as i mentioned though there's more than just updates to existing items you all have left comments with lots of really good suggestions of new products to add to the database so check some of these out perfect bars come in a bunch of flavors most of which are rated very light they've got a nice amount of protein and the calorie counts a bit more substantial than a lot of the snack sized bars hempia bars are also mostly very light with good protein for their size and look at these yes bars well hello beautiful where have you been optimized trail fuel that also happens to be ultra light and along those lines nature valley's coated wafers are another ultralight optimal fuel option in the spirit of using the data to learn lessons about how to shop when browsing an unfamiliar selection in a local store both these nature valley options and the power crunch bars are in the coated wafer style so look to those as possibly high density choices in general also added some nature valley protein options and protein bars are almost always heavier than others but these are still in the very light range 88 acres makes bars in several flavors there's a very light option but also several in the optimal fuel range and while it was on their site i noticed that 88 acres also makes a series of seed butters and there's been comments from multiple people lamenting that if you can't eat nuts you're basically screwed when it comes to density well not necessarily so i had a few in there already but if you can still eat seeds here's five new flavors of nut-free butter that all rank ultra-light they've got three kinds of sunflower butter one of pumpkin seeds and another from watermelon seeds and while i was there i updated and expanded the justin's nut butters they raised some calories even higher than they were before now all of them rank hyper light and just a note on accuracy versus changes sometimes they legitimately change the nutrition information and therefore update the labels accordingly other times however the problem may be a disconnect between what the website says and how the label reads on the actual product itself case in point i wanted to try these 88 acres seed butters so i ordered a sampler pack and upon receiving them i noted that the label didn't match the website in such cases i used the label finishing up with the bars the coconut secret brand almond coconut bars that used to be an ultra option at number three on the list have apparently been discontinued in their place coconut secret now has three flavors of what they call a green free granola bar two of which are ultralight and now hold the number two and number four spots on the list so poking around for other green free granola bars on amazon led me to the new number one bar and the first bar ever to rate as hyperlite autumn's gold grain free granola bar in cinnamon and almond 170 calories per ounce that is until they change it anyway this is what the top 30 bars now look like by density and the next 30. there were interesting suggestions in a lot of categories bone broth comes in convenient packets makes for a flavorful savory protein bump kind of the way you use onion soup mix when cooking at home to add flavor to your recipes these broth packets make a nice way to both season your backpacking meals and add 10 grams of protein i've already used them in ramen which i love but it's a little low on protein for what i want out of a trail dinner and they do add additional sodium if that's a concern remember the electrolytes video you might actually want that for flavor balancing when adding one to ramen i just increased the amount of water to keep the saltiness roughly the same and i enjoy drinking the extra hot broth and i did look around though and i found these loto life brand with a low sodium option if you prefer and i'd never noticed these but quaker instant oatmeal makes some protein flavors and like all oatmeals they're on the heavy side but check out those ratios if you're making hot breakfast from a base camp these could be an excellent fuel to start those day hikes now i had put in joyva's sesame crunch candies but i missed their halva marble here we go again with label mismatches the amazon listing included this screenshot well that works out to 194 calories per ounce and it would put these easily at the top of the list above all the dark chocolates naturally i ordered some immediately well this is the actual label of what arrived now that's still a respectable 150 calories per ounce but it does drop from ultra light to very light i just bring it up in case you're checking items and keep finding all these mistakes oh and somehow overlooked peanut butter m m's which happen to be the lightest version of them all and there's a new sheriff in cookie town as well walker's vanilla shortbread aces out keebler's sandies for the top spot in the cookie section i already mentioned adding the lenny and larry slavers but i also put in a few more options of oreos turns out the golden cookies have better density than the original chocolate and the more stuffing the better so the golden double stuffs end up being the lightest oreo i could find in the drinks section i realized that i never put an entry in for my own custom recovery mix so that's there now also in adding it and looking at the numbers i realized its ratio of about 3.4 would go to a near perfect 3.9 with just one additional tablespoon of dextrose so four instead of three in the recovery video i also talked about mics and melissa's mixes and they weren't in there either for some reason so they are now and a couple of other new recovery drinks suggested by you endurox r4 makes a perfect 4.0 and hammer nutrition has both a regular and a vegan option for those that prefer and then last take a gander at the new number one coconut milk powder i'm thinking it could be a bump for some of the dried meals maybe one of the pad thais a coconut cream sauce anyone or put it in your coffee as they suggest and then lastly we come to sides now i had put in stuff like rice and quinoa and couscous but i never really entered things like dried beans or peas so there are now several new options for you to compare as far as the freeze-dried meals chart goes that got a complete overhaul when i built that chart it was before i got into any of the nutritional analysis so all it had was the basics for calculating caloric density well jeff blum contacted me about adding the rest of the nutrition label data to every meal on the chart we split up the job and it's finally done now you can check meals for their fat content sodium levels carbs sugar protein and more and that also enables the inclusion of the nutritional analysis columns so instead of just looking for the lightest weight breakfasts you can sort by ratio and see which ones might give you the best launch on your day in doing all that we noticed the large amount of changes and there were new flavors added old flavors apparently discontinued and a lot of packaged calorie counts changed as well mountain house for example has come out with new packaging and it's not just cosmetic they changed their entrees from two and a half servings per pouch to two so all of those updates have been reflected in the chart and while we're on mountain house they seem to have retired some pouches but it's not exactly clear how many this blog post at the epicenter lists just a few but there are more that don't currently appear on mountain house's website so i'm not sure if they're retired or just currently out of stock so what i did was put the stuff you can't currently order in red it's either retired or just not available time will tell but hey if you're like me and you buy the adventure boxes from costco for basically half price you could easily still have some of these flavors left over in your supplies similarly it appears the military may have changed the specs for their long-range patrol meals of which mountain house was a supplier and they may just be using the pro packs now so i put all the lrps in green now i've had multiple inquiries about what to do regarding recovery snacks if you don't follow the eating schedule i laid out as an example in that video namely what would i suggest as a recovery strategy for someone who doesn't stop hiking after dinner some people like to keep going for another few hours before making camp for the night without making this whole video about that here's a rough outline of what i would do in that circumstance first you don't have to be done for the day to have a recovery drink you also aren't limited to just one so if you're keeping the hard pace of an adventure racer you might consider packing at least two recovery drink mixes per day and spread them out over the hours you'll be hiking avoid the caffeine part if you take your last one right before bed and for those that like to hike after dinner consider trying to make the dinner itself as close to a recovery mix as possible in other words look for meals that have an optimum ratio use the new nutritional columns and sort by carb pro to help find the ones you like then have a dessert once you finally do stop and use the foods list to find the one that looks like a recovery apart from all the data upgrades and flavor changes i also found a new brand of dried meals to add to the list i was in rei lurking in the food section when i spotted spicy pork noodle in this flashy yellow pouch it says each one is handmade in rural england using natural ingredients in their unique dehydration technology hopefully it tastes good you may also have noted that i moved a few things out of the way and this was to make all the columns from brand through protein run in the same order as they do in the foods chart and that will make it easier on you when building menus you could just copy and paste foods from either the foods or the meals chart into one consistent list to that end i made a few functional changes to the chart i moved the dried meals into the same spreadsheet with the hiker foods they're now both in the one downloadable file just on separate tabs i also added a couple of planning tools adam salinger asked me if i could make a fill in the blanks list where foods and meals could be added by the user with a totals line at the bottom and that way you can use it like a menu planner build a list of the day's foods breakfast trail snacks lunch recovery dinner dessert you name it put everything you'll eat in a day into the list and then see how it all totals up you'll be able to see at a glance some key metrics like your total calories and weight you can also now see how your personal menus measure out in overall density make sure you're getting enough protein track your total sodium intake in this example of what i might take i manage an average density of 151 calories per ounce which gives me just over 3000 calories a day for just 20 ounces total protein looks good given the activity levels but my sodium for the day looks low so realizing that informs me to make sure i bring electrolyte supplements especially if it's going to be hot one note remember that the foods and meals in the chart are based upon the nutrition label which is always calibrated to one serving so for many foods like nutrition bars one serving is one bar but for items sold in bulk packaging or the dried meals in particular there might be multiple servings per container so if you eat the whole pouch like i do the way to handle two servings is to enter it twice lastly i'm able to make sure that from breakfast through trail snacks to recovery my fuel ratio looks good also how's that you say i see some items there that are way outside the optimum range remember food combos you can combine separate items into one snack by eating them together roughly at the same time so i added a combo calculator to help you find these pairings it's basically a pack of mini menu planner charts each with their own totals if you've got a favorite food with a particularly low or high ratio look for something else with the opposite plop them in the calculator and see how they figure as a couple with that in mind you can see that those out of whack items in my sample menu are actually well balanced when considered in pairs i'll put a link to download this new chart in the description below and then last but certainly not least there was a reason that jeff blum wanted to expand the dried meals to include all the nutrition data on the label he's taken the whole chart to another level first with the comparative data in place he combined the hiker foods and the dried meals into a single massive list and that list is a google sheet available both on and offline he's also added the ability to mark favorites and build a shopping list that you can carry on your phone and use in remote markets even when there's no signal he's got a post on his blog with instructions for use and a link to download his chart that's it for this update folks like i said it's going to have to be sort of a living document so leave your comments here if you see things that need changing i'll make a note and do periodic corrections without producing a video every time i think i'll just leave the version date in the description box so you'll know as always i very much appreciate your time and thanks for watching", "LruGI3IUZ1A": "today Kevin and I are gonna try three more things from Sarah in California I think I'm gonna pronounce this right America I think this is America brands premium chocolate I have dark chocolate sea salt caramel popcorn that looks like that and Kevin has chocolate toffee almond and then we have mint chip malt balls so which one do you want to try fresh California almonds and a crispy a crisp toffee glaze and creamy milk chocolate these are the whole package is 340 pounds it's Marit Marit confectionery company Hollister California I wonder if that's where Hollister solar-type I suppose we have a Hollister in our mall that's all he's never heard he's good yes it's a little bit of a salt content to and I'm not used to those it be chocolate covered almonds they have that crunchy topping sugary chocolate there's a crunchy sugary my arm and then you get to the net on the inside of those are those will be addictive very good and 340 hours the little d-bag oh is that how much it is yeah so you've brought on one is that are they healthy this one's crispy caramelized popcorn inside rich dark chocolate and a hint of sea salt this is pop this one's 240 caramel sugar basically pretty big other salt that's good rogon I would like that to try that no trouble although the dark part these are made out of is not a ruling well it may be bitter but it it gets overtaken by all the comb on the salt so good that's the movie theater instead of offering just buttered popcorn they should offer something so I have chocolate drizzle on top or something do we have all over America that's what I want to hear somebody licking their fingers in there all I mean hey these are chip mint chip moth balls crispy moth balls layered and dark chocolate and mint cookie confesses YUM they are 2:30 do at that salt well you won't know for those these are actually running the couple eggs I give you the big ones though cuz you bite in them and then you shout it out if you can show the little one as well grow contin mmm there's a milk chocolate and in the moth ball let's have a good in my room almost like a Amy's or something that's delicious it goes well with the malt the malt flavor - there's nothing oh oh really I did I do know I did Jaron Johnson my one eye fair ones is probably the top one what you're shocking because it's dark one of my favorites with my favorite favorite ones probably the talk about the almonds all those mental they're all they're all good I would buy any of those again yeah the only reason I would avoid the elements because there's just so many calories and I couldn't stop with half a packet don't have to eat the whole thing yeah you guys well and people probably downloads and don't even look at the calories so but they were all the losers were all really good so thank you very much for everything you sent we really appreciate it this is the last of the trials for the California the things she sent from California even though they're not all made in California she sent them from California so you will they will be under a California playlist just because that's where they were shipped they were melted made from but if you haven't watched the other videos from her then go back and watch those because she sent me a lot of cool stuff that is made right here some stuffs made in Canada so it's really neat so thank you again Sara and thanks for watching", "Z2j-Dk4KiRs": "today Kevin and I are gonna try to Russell Stover candies that we haven't tried before and actually didn't want to be a part of this video because they have coconut and actually it's not a coconut girl we have Russell Stover coconut and almond in milk chocolate and we have Russell Stover dark chocolate and coconut cream I mean I can eat them but they're not my favorite and it's not pumpkin shade but it didn't claim to be I don't think you know what I'm not gonna use this knife I'm just gonna tear it tear into it like this oh yeah that's all the coconut the bottom mmm I'll give you the big one don't eat just take it one thing I love the texture mm-hmm first I was just getting almond and then all of a sudden the coconut kicked in I was really good that is a very nice coconut mm-hmm that's a good squishy coconut it takes fresh we've had some coconut lately that's in something else which that was - yeah it was Drive this was that was is really really good coconut that is fresh the chocolates good the almonds good I like the texture yeah that's actually really good Oh reminds me of home into a candy bar this would say it's a pumpkin and this is there's no nut in here um it's just a pumpkin oh it's coconut cream yeah that's a this looks like marshmallow it looks like it looks black on camera it's dark dark chocolate and coconut cream and this tastes like the medals that's what it is it's really good but I wish they'd put the coconut from the almond woman in that that squishy solid coconut cuz I like the texture of the little grains of coconut in there you don't really get a lot of that in there I'm not measured with coconut person and I would eat both of those again yeah oh the other bump really really good they are both for me personally if I had to write them I would give both of them like 5 out of 5 both very very good now you you have calories to spend they're both laying there which one are you gonna choose um I actually like the I like sure I end up liking this I think I did too cuz it's sweeter it's sweeter and you don't have all those nuts too and I'm not I guess I don't really like a woman's that much and I do like nuts and I like this because it's sweeter and they do have the coconut texture in there it's just not full of it like the other one was there is a cup you do feel the coconut in there yeah it's just not solid piece of coconut it's just like all scattered either so that's really really good this was fewer calories this one was 20 fewer calories than the one with nuts how much do the almonds add a lot of calories which one was that one again this is the dark chocolate and coconut cream and it only had 120 calories in it so I would def I would get both of them again but how much really they were these are like 50 cents for 50 cents and you get you get probably less calories than you would a candy bar I would eat these over a man's candy bar oh yeah definitely definitely they're good we actually bought these we actually bought these at Hallmark so if you have a hallmark near you but we should see these at CVS or rite-aid right yeah they also they so you definitely need to look for them and thanks for watching", "jPL2LSZzqK4": "today Kevin and I have three very very random items but I always try to put more than one thing in a video if I can just to make it worth your time to click on it so these are new to us this one actually says it's no it is the Lent excellence dark chocolate bar a touch of sea salt and I have a Mahalo bar which thank you it is coconut and almonds in a chocolatey coating and then have an awake bar that is just caffeinated chocolate it's in it yes yes so we've tried some awake Mars in the past but when heaven had the mint yet and I'm just gonna go ahead and give you the prices the lips and a white bars were both bought at Meijer the lint bar was $1 9 and the awake bar was $1 and then the Mahalo the thank-you bar was bought at world market and it was a dollar 79 so world markets use a little bit higher and this was upfront as you check out so they have a lot of interesting things there so we're gonna try the Lent dark chocolate bar first a touch of sea salt it is 160 calories it's not big boy it was it admire they have like the seasonal Christmas candy I don't know right in the middle and it's pretty shiny and this was like on an end cap it was out in the middle but it was like on a little in caps display yeah I was hard more to do half better yeah good snap it it wasn't with all the other candies or chocolates it was like hanging on display right hmm it's all those good then it's incredibly smooth mm-hmm yeah other dextran back assaulted and I got the song ah for me I didn't know if it's also very end no yeah I got more crystals of salt mm-hmm it would just depend on what piece which piece you have it is dark it is dark but it's not like ooh that's a really bitter dry your mouth out of darkest right it's a good door yes I like to go this in hey there are 3-3 bars there's like a little perforation yeah so the tour you can break them off this would be nice it's even break one of those in high oh yeah definitely and put it on your tongue and just let it melt like a Hershey kiss if you do that with Hershey Kisses you could do the same with this because this this would be nice just to let it go yes I would break these up knowing what they are now I would break them up in the pocket before I even open them don't take my hand go snap all the way down and then open it up that started that way you're not touching it all with your fingers yeah that's very smart I like that idea so now we have the mahalo gluten free vegan no trans fat nothing artificial candy bar what does that say cuz I can't it says go max go foods so that's a couple go max go foods coconut and almonds in a chocolaty coating it is 57 grams is 280 calories let me open it up good okay so this is like an own enjoy and then looking at with almonds on top just later almond joy but it's vegan and I'm assuming maybe almond joy is not vegan I've got I don't know yeah that's a lot harder than oh this is interesting I just assumed I guess you shouldn't assume anything that because it looks like a Hawaiian package and it's called Mahalo that it was from Hawaii in California it's from its from Mint Hill North Carolina that's worth its front way so it's like okay that's interesting just because I was expecting Hawaii and nope it's from North Carolina I'll try to give you a home enough costumes oh okay there's a lot to chew I think it's delicious though the coconuts a lot thicker very thick the mountains mm-hmm dance it's like really packed in there um I think it's delicious I think it's very good I like a mountains better because it's sweeter but really yeah mounds are over-the-top sweet I love that extra dough yeah dr. Scott that's all thing thickness and yes that when when you get a bite you you have so much - chairman - do you know each bite is is it that is going to last you awhile and it is but you know unless you are these things are vegan yes unless you're vegan I think I would just regular pay the regular price for a mounds or an Almond Joy honestly that's my personal opinion no I would just I would assume not waste dollar 70 on something that that makes a difference to me way out of your sight yeah yeah actually like the flavor almond oil or mountains as good it's not bad or this so he's speaking from mainly money if you can get amounts for 89 cents then why would you spend the dollar 70 not sure unless you're vegan I understand that completely I mean I'm not saying it the bad is because I'm cheap - yes and I'm cheap - and that is how I think of a lot of things you know and why would I spend so much on this when I can get the store brand that's cheaper you know what I just don't think it's the size it's not like it's heads and tails over I already know I value more even be just as good right well let me tell you if you are vegan this is delicious I think it's very good I love the texture of it definitely worked on let's say I don't eat it I'm just saying for me I think you'll be very very pleased with this bark you've never tried it before very good and now we have the net awake this is a caffeinated chocolate no artificial flavors or colors it's 150 calories per bar and it's free it's not very far either no it says consuming one piece of awake has been known to inspire activities such as reading a news magazine cover to cover formatting a fussy spreadsheet washing a medium shaggy-dog writing to the site full blog post playing a particularly festive game of hearts or perhaps introducing yourself to your latest crush it's let me try - I'll try to ring you about why you're looking at it because it's a toddler so okay so you get two pieces oh they're so cute you have to hold it up cuz that's cute like put your hand back yeah it's an owl that's their their rub logo do it smells good symptoms may include building a log cabin from trees you felled yourself inventing a new dance performed entirely on your hands or in some cases leading the entire world in a harmonious song of love the peaks what was that like - yeah nice - love it Marshall coming down the hill there was a hacky commercial very smooth chocolate these are made in Canada Ontario Canada it's good the myths but it's nice it's not toothpaste eat your mouthwash you know it's just a nice like at Amy's kind of mill if you're wondering about the caffeine content it says two pieces which is what you get in the candy bar in the package two pieces equals one cup of joe yeah there's so many different coffee 100 milligrams two pieces 30 grams of caffeine 100 milligrams caffeine content yes not recommended for children pregnant or nursing women and persons sensitive to caffeine usage is four pieces per day maximum we've had drinks though that have like oh yeah yeah it's where you're like let's see they'd never do anything for me literally of course we're used to drinking coffee so right yeah we yeah oh I like um the flavors were good the texture was good it's a nice chocolate it's not too bitter it the mint is not overpowering it does not taste like toothpaste it tastes just has a nice minty flavor so if these give you that extra boost that you need your futures like flavor of them then you know I don't think a dollar a dollar a piece is that how much it was awake yeah a dollar piece I don't think that no no that's about comfortable to most campers my favorite tool in bathrooms good thing now you can't compare a really it's it's hard there are three different bars yeah like what I buy go back to the storm aisle about this one that's with the sea salt oh I don't really like this a lot Mahalo brothers spend money on other things yeah I just I really like that coconut I like that texture I like getting that you know just having that little extra to chew on yeah see I would enjoy let this just piece of lamb your time to smell the smooth chocolate right do y'all like that chew and then you have all that coconut to chew on Mei works good too the white is good yeah it's just different no it's not somebody exactly we've said that before men isn't an everyday flavor but for me the coconut and the chocolate would be in everyday flavor for me so I hope you all enjoyed the video well I'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "2qlp5pNcgSY": "so hello everyone and welcome to food eureka my name is MJ and so we are doing another flavor of Tony's chalk alone Lee this is the salted caramel variety this was sent to us by Bryn Harding so massive shower to him he said it's 12 flavors from his recent trip to Holland this is a Holland bar but it is now available in the UK and I believe this flavour is available in the UK as well I'll flash up on screen if that's definitely true or not this company have got really nice message they want to get rid of slavery in chocolate so the design of the bar is lot blocked in two uneven shapes to represent the inequality in the chocolate farming industry which is really cool and I just try to cover up a bit I'm sorry that was rude and I wish I didn't do it but I certainly wish though I should just reset what I said and not confess to it anyway yeah this is a it's from Holland so it's a what a Dutch spa Dutch that's what is Dutch right so I can't read the ingredients or anything but I do know that it is salted caramel it is 32 percent I think that's about you 2 percent cocoa solids or maybe cocoa butter or cocoa solids bar so it should be a good quality milk chocolate with a nice sea salt and caramel flavouring I'm not getting much in the web or hashtag food flavor not getting much in the West smell this is the first sort of flavor door or unusual flavor of theirs I'm trying the other flavors are fried up in milk dark milk and white oh right it looks like that on the inside like the other balls let's go eat go go right mmm-hmm that salt oh wow that's always strong mm-hmm oh man oh that is excellent so it's got these little tiny caramel chunks in very crispy but they're so small that don't really get stuck in your teeth or anything and actually more it's the intensity of the salt there that really just intensifies everything the caramel flavor it's light but it's there it's like a nice sort of classic hard caramel they're crispy caramel taste but then this hugely intense salt which intensifies all of the sweetness of that deliciously rich and good quality bar wow that is really something special absolutely love the soy in there I've got have another piece actually right think I've managed to get a cross-section for you and Jay had it out of your long nails please so they go you can kind of see the caramel there let's give it a go I can just feel it on my tongue breaking news man put something in mouth can feel it on his tongue hmm good quality this is a salted caramel that is actually salty brilliant we love to see that ma'am there's absolutely delicious chocolate without these big chunks are so stuck at the back of my mouth and it's just making my taste buds go wild I get a high five stars [Music] as for sure my favorite bath so far honestly I would I would just the like sea salt chocolate and something sweet food is so good wow that's amazing guys you have to check out his brand they're available in places like Waitrose and Sainsbury's they should not be available and of course you can buy them online as well but definitely recommend them it's a 180 gram bar by the way thank you very much watching check out our podcast frock unwrapped you can listen with your ears and you'll enjoy it and we will see you next time thank you [Applause] [Music]", "q8FRO9nTQOU": "today Kevin and I are

calories is what thank you oh we should have done that got in the calculator so we could see how much each pieces it is 310 calories if you eat the entire thing but I'm thinking it's probably in yet therefore 687 310 so 30 31 calories per square okay they're just all talk truffle I'm only going to half of that we do the next one we saved these when we do were these two reviews I don't what you think with why step we said these for later when we have snacks and you know we'll put in a ziplock baggie and then we get it all out that's out time it's not spectacular okay it's an okay chocolate

Bunny you know yes that's the that's a good job now this a murder this is gonna be like a French bar this is like so 310 Hill I know talking with Ross prison wife do you take a half an arrow I will have close-up pictures it's basically the same thing that what cut slice yeah the buggers not any different no it's just a texture thing yeah those little crust crispy crunchy pieces in there I like that better I did too it actually tastes a little sweeter yeah it did I don't know what I did to meet you know I guess the cereal miss Peter yeah that tastes sweeter than just the regular about Java that's so weird it still tastes like he's a jock but that is so much better no it was better than perfect this one is milk chocolate almond and it is 320 calories so 10 more calories but you get almonds okay them you can definitely taste the almonds yeah whole crisp in there okay that's my favorite yeah mine too so far because you really really added to get any crunch of the nut later was kind of it was like the flavor was there then I saw it but there was no later yeah there was no crunch to it at all but I love up like damn good flavor this is a very like chocolate but yeah but that one has destroys larvae or something okay now this is dark chocolate so this would be really interesting this one is only three entertained gallery so three of them were 310 and the ones with the necklace 320 mixes and it is dog hmm no absolutely like that you probably done and it really tasted like honking I think that taste hmm I got an after Oswald it has that special dark mm-hmm Blackwell to it very much it's not super bitter but it definitely is a dark rock yes it's definitely dark Rob but it has its it's like the Hershey's special dark I what every would remind you of crisper than that though yeah soft but yeah I like the crystal but yeah I really do like that texture that's almost the texture of when you buy it and Walmart in the banking out and you want to get the baking bars in the banking bars that's the texture of that it's the texture of a baking bar but my favorite is still the almond my haunted so that was that was really really good well I'll have pictures of all

Heysel that I don't taste it I barely taste the cream the dark chocolate kind of it's pretty strong way he's out everything else now see I'm leaving I'm leaving with the hazelnut I would really like

much so guy like I said I'll have a picture for you all at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "Lcwj7fUWTzg": "[Music] okay positive on those things that's just the easiest quickest most brilliant breakfast but it can be quite boring so we're gonna do an indulgent porridge today which is a seesaw almond butter chocolate orange basically a bowl of heaven for a winter's day okay so the first thing you need at your porridge oats we're using porridge oats rather than jumbo oh it's just because they cook so much quicker that's how they for a quicker breakfast then we're gonna add our cacao powder which is what makes it so chocolaty then I almond butter and cooking it in a non-budget just makes it so rich and creamy you could swap that for any nut butter though a little bit of coconut sugar for sweetness you can skip that if you prefer use any other sweetener pinch of sea salt just to balance out that sweetness and then we're gonna add some almond milk or milk or coconut milk so once it's all in the pan we're gonna bring the pan to the hob and then just start slowly stirring it and it's gonna thicken and go like a star chocolatey heavenly color it's only gonna take like three or four minutes to cook cause the porridge oats are so quick so just keep stirring it as a thickens you might need to add a bit more milk if you need to and then once you're ready you're just gonna pour it into your bowl lucio so big and and creamy and then you can top it with whatever you won I'm gonna put some coconut yogurt some banana slices so now we're gonna add just a sprinkling cacao nibs if you've got them just adds a bit of crunch and then lastly all the armored butter because I'm a nut butter addict and it's happen so here we go chocolate porridge with all the almond butter as you can see this is such an indulgent but literally five minute breakfast so if it's a kind of rainy morning and you need a bit of or a lazy weekend this is the dream you can add all the toppings to it and please do as with all our recipes let me know if you hire this is going to be a staple for me throughout winter and hopefully theity so chocolate in [Music]", "P1-76FEObMU": "today kevin and i are going to be trying four belt bars thank you very much to elle and valerie for sending us these they sent us a mixed box of built bars i have the peanut butter the peanut butter brownie caramel brownie and toffee almonds coffee almond i cannot read these at all with my glasses on kevin kevin you should put these glasses on i should uh this is the peanut butter 100 real chocolate zero guilt it is 180 calories for the bar we uh we got these in the mail we put them in the refrigerator you do not have to do that um actually i would prefer to to eat them plain to not put them in the refrigerator if you want to know the truth um but you'd already done it but i had already done it when i remembered hey i prefer these out of the river i prefer the texture out of the refrigerator so and then once you put them in the refrigerator you don't want to take them out and leave them sitting out because they get yeah they get really claggy and so you either you do it or you don't do it either put them in the refrigerator or don't so this is the peanut butter and it's 180. it has 19 grams of protein it has a good like not sticky calm just like a caramel texture which would take you a while to eat i love the peanut butter flavor in there mm-hmm it is at first i was just getting plain peanut yeah but there really is a sweetness behind it that makes you think more peanut butter and it's really good with that chocolate coating um yeah i like that quite a bit i like it it's not a sweet version of the bar like they got some that are kind of sweeter that one's not one that's more of a more peanutty than peanut yeah if you like peanut anyway then if you like a peanutty peanut butter uh then you will like this where you taste more of the natural peanut than the sweetness that's what we mean by that that's very good so now we're going to peanut butter brownies so i paired these in together on purpose so we can compare what peanut butter to peanut butter brownie would be the difference in flavor so there this one's 180 calories as well it has 19 grams of protein as well and they say they're gluten free no preservatives natural flavoring and you can go to billbar.com and see all these you see how small slices i'm cutting over these and it takes a second to chew it that's the difference between putting in the refrigerator and leaving it out now you leave it out you can eat it much faster i like that one too and it really does have a brownie flavor i think did you think most of peanut butter though was covered up with the chocolate yes i thought it mainly tasted like brownie and not peanut butter anymore yeah the peanut butter is kind of overwhelmed yes by the darker chocolate flavor but i really do like that brownie flavor because it tastes like um a brownie in a a dough almost in the pan not a dough but the bread the batter the bread i would have brother that's my personal opinion i would have rather had like a walnut flavor than a peanut flavor in there oh could you think it would have stood out it would have been a brownie walnut brownie with walnuts instead of a peanut butter which i can't even taste maybe that'll be would be expensive i don't know because i doubt they're using them well they could use but i very much like that so which one this is a hard question which one do you prefer that the peanut butter one yeah cause the chocolate's good but it's just brownie i don't get any peanut butter right okay this is the caramel brownie so now we're going away from the peanut butter and we're introducing caramel with the brownies yeah let's see if the caramel comes out this is the lowest calorie of the four we're going to be trying today this one is only 130 calories so a lot of their bars are only 130 calories softer for some reason wow caramel instant like picture taste buds that's like a buttery caramel almost butterscotchy hmm that's really good it's a very strong caramel does it almost remind you of butterscotch tea a little bit yeah rich kind of buttery contact yeah because it's so very very strong that yes it almost does take on a better scratch i don't think they have a better scotch bar no no we haven't had butterscotch in a long time no i don't think they have one of those that's something to think about um well that's pretty darn close yes but i will say i don't taste the brownies no at all you just taste the caramel which is fine with me because i don't i don't think i necessarily like their brownie flavor see how real it's a little dark for me it adds a little bitterness that i don't enjoy i truly enjoyed it very much it's good but but it is a darker yellow so it's not really hype for me but it's funny because i didn't think you could cover up the brownie flavor because it is darker and you can because that caramel is so so strong that it completely overran the brownie yeah now aftertaste i still taste the caramel but i also get a little bit of that chocolate bitterness too because it has like that lingering flavor right now this one i'm really excited about this is toffee almond and the calories on this one are kind of right in the middle uh so we had a two that were 180 one that was 130 this one is 160. and it still has 19 grams of protein has a little nuts oh okay it's probably the toffee oh yeah that looks nice i like the flavor though i don't know if i would have said toffee but you would say almond i get the almond almost cherry-like flavor i agree with you that's good i like the flavor of it i get a strong almond flavor which i like so i don't have a problem with but i would notice a topic no i think it needed some crunchy bits in it to be called yeah because we love chopping and we love the sweetness of topping so i was wondering how they were going to do that in one of these lower calories you know these are all kind of lower calorie bars um so when i think of toffee i think of roca yeah see i think he throws a heath bar yeah marshmallow yeah yeah those are delicious uh so it's very good though it's very super super sweet i still i guess i still like it i think all four of these bars i'm i'm actually really impressed i was ready to not like the uh peanut butter brownie yeah because usually well the peanut butter in general is usually kind of we had another we had we've had one out of all that we've tried we've had one that i didn't care for and it was chocolate and so i was ready i thought i'm probably not gonna like that chocolate but you know what i like all of these um out of all the reviews we've done so far there's only been one bar that i wouldn't get again and that is saying a lot because uh they have some very unique flavors um but uh so what would if you could only buy the home one okay i would definitely get the caramel bread because i love that i love butterscotch anyway and if it has that rich butterscotch flavor i would get that and i'm going to pick the one he wouldn't i'm going to pick the peanut butter bread that would be my life i knew it because i like that brownie flavor and it's a it's a dark a rich but if you don't like bitter then then you would like it yeah and see i don't i'm not sensitive to that like cabinets these bars they're good quality they all have basically the same texture so they all have that that soft caramel texture when they're cold and but they um the flavors are so different from each one each one of them are so different from each other it's amazing how they really because sometimes that bars are kind of all the same right uh flavor-wise these are all distinctly different flavors so i like that well it'll take you a while to eat them i've saved i think the most unique flavors for the last video so we have one more we have other built reviews to do that aren't for the yes there are products not bars but we have one more video and you should be seeing it tomorrow that has some very very unique flavors and i saved that for last on purpose so that is not squirrel you know then it's okay but they're they're not your run-of-the-mill peanut butter or cherry or orange or something like that these are these are different flavors so i hope you enjoyed the video thank you again to elle and valerie for sending us these and thanks for watching [Music] you", "sn7N9C1eiV4": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying for new to us chocolate bars these are Tony's Chuck colony bars I have the milk chocolate the almond sea salt this one's the caramel sea salt and chocolate extra you know what this is dark chocolate sea salt so do you wanna switch these around okay so we're gonna try the milk chocolate parks these were 399 each at the Fresh Market and I know that sounds expensive but there are four servings in the bar if you eat it the way that they continue for you to eat it quite chunky that says hello there I'm Tony's Chuck colony I exist you in slavery in the chocolate industry my mission is to make 100 percent slave free the norm in chocolate together with you together will make chocolate 100 percent slave free are you in read the inside of the wrapper okay so I didn't either so we'll have to read that these are mainly in Portland Oregon ww Tony's chocolaty calm board / us is the website one-fourth of the bar is 230 calories so I'm gonna look at the inside of the rec room share our chocolate and share our story right now slants are working on cocoa farms in West Africa many of them are children Tony's choc colony exists to change that our vision is we already ripped all this really it tells nothing more on the inside than it's all on the Alpha I don't see any more operations there thank you John in West Africa and its children many of them are children that's cool-looking it's pretty cool so what I would recommend is to go to their website if you want to hear more about their story and find out what's going on from there because honestly I thought there would be more aggression on the inside the only bad thing about being broken up in this school pattern is how do you figure out for Washington exactly you would have to wait you have a way because Kevin's absolutely right although that's really cool the bike that I got used it was this big amongst narrow but the piece that says Tony's is huge you know so anyone it's a minor thing but it has a lot of Hamas up topic on forum it does that's delicious that doesn't taste like straight milk chocolate mm-hmm it tastes like it has copied it that it doesn't but that's what it tastes like I would have never thought that there would be so much flavor then just a milk chocolate bar I would have thought this would have been the finest most boring as before that is delicious this very room Secession you're like talking like a heath bar or something like that school or something like that you'll really like that because it's done yeah there's so much chocolate there also you can break that thing up and just eat a little piece here and there and enjoy more than four servings but definitely does have a toffee like flavor to it though so there's oh okay this one are they all different yes no 1/4 of ours to enter 30 calories yeah what almost 240 okay this is caramel and sea salt so it's milk chocolate caramel and sea salt the they're hit without tearing it the whole thing he's gone upstairs but we'll put it in a ziploc bag it'll light them you can see the Solomons in them same pattern on the front looks yes yeah okay break me off a piece like Tony's yeah and there's a little big long piece there I didn't see that before yeah they don't break you in life hmm it's all animal personal assault I can I don't really taste the almonds coz they're not very many of them in there it's not it's caramel sea salt oh okay it's one of those little bits our Leslie caramel there's not a lot of them in there they're kind of spread out but you can see in the bottom they're not everywhere they're just here there so depends on what you get it must be the caramel that made that chocolate the regular milk chocolate bar so good give it that toffee fiber because this one has that same flavor except it's intensified by like 20 was this fun no no the moment is milk chocolate flavor the flavor the milk chocolate bar had a toffee nut flavor well that flavor to me is in this bar times 20 that stronger and it's supposed to be the caramel so I'm saying whatever caramel they used in this bar they had to put some of it in that milk juggle bar for it to have that same vibrant nuns are both very good I mean delicious oh thanks oh do you want to drunk let's try the Ewoks and almond sea salt the dark chocolate bar because it's 51% it won't be as dark okay what is extra I didn't even notice that when I bought it if it's a smooth talker oh no I don't need those really the last one that we're gonna drive pretty dark but someone had when they saw my grocery haul when they saw these in my grocery haul they had commented I love those bars the only bad thing about those bars is that I buy them and I go through them too quickly I eat them too fast and I thought I'll go be good but they won't be back yes I agree those the first two that we tried are that good your point horrible mm-hmm it has that crisp snap the snap it's all mmm-hmm it's actually the dark chocolate I like the dark chocolate in the salt they go good go it's a good dark chocolate but it wouldn't be one that I would bomb and just cuz I don't know that's how I prefer the milk but it is a good door if you are a dark chocolate lover you would enjoy that you do get the seesaw you do get the almond and it's not suit it's a bitter I mean it's dark but it's not like bitter like him bitter I don't too many it's war or hate really sad no I don't really got me a noodle that said it's a little Barbie but I'm bad let's see what reserve the radish throw it to the side this is 240 calories is this more than the other yeah how could this be more calories then the milk chocolate caramel sea salt about 10 calories I just you wouldn't think that because this is 70 70 percent extra dark chocolate or program or okay yeah find a small piece the only honestly the only problem I have is the way that it is made of dough it's chopped up so just really snappy mmm I'm a tomboy no I do like that extra though that's like something you would use to bake with mm-hmm do you want them it's not bad though no it's not and how about coffee yeah I can see that it does have that dark flavor yeah and a little bit of bitterness to it but it's nothing sharp biting bitterness you know it's there but it's not like a I mean like even a Hershey's special dark then those are bitter and like almost like a biting like a it's almost so bitter you don't enjoy it or these I know right these are bitter but they're a smooth enjoyable bitterness to it right nothing I would buy these cuz I'm not a dark chocolate person but though you like to our target these are awesome I just need another piece of the chocolate the milk chocolate firm will see some articles and I got a lot of sea salt it's not buying yeah I was I love sea salt chocolate I think yeah that one's my favorite yeah this one the orange one mm-hmm dark chocolate caramel signal not dark chocolate milk chocolate caramel sea salt it's the best one that's the best one in the second one is the milk and I'm telling you that the milk is like no other milk that I've had because it has that caramel flavor in it very good yes these are excellent bars so if you see them don't be afraid to pay 399 for them especially if you're gonna divvy amount it's gonna be kind of hard to today via my you know just cuz the white room hey well if you're shopping up the fresh market well we got this at you you're not you don't yeah you know yes it's very it's an expensive store as it is so I will have a picture for you at the end of these I will probably only take one of a milk and one of a dark because honestly you can't tell the difference really in one and the other just to look at it so I'll I'll take just a picture of one of each for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "t0yKywTwAXA": "[Music] hey guys today we're making that almond butter chocolate bars they're vegan and to begin with we need to melt together almond butter and agave syrup you like a medium saucier pan and just make sure that you combine it nicely together put it over a very low heat so it doesn't burn and then once it starts boiling a little bit we're going to mix it up make sure that everything is very smooth and mixed evenly oh my god it's so delicious I'm actually getting hungry just by looking at it all right once it's all mixed we're going to add two cups of pods and I actually decided to add even milk to it I ended up I didn't almost a whole cup of soy milk because I couldn't just combine the oats and all about it together but the milk really helped and made it beautiful so I highly recommend that you use milk and also combine heat it and then once it's all smooth and cooked press it firmly into a brownie tin make sure that it's as leveled as possible it should be really flat you can use a spatula for this will no be awesome to have spatula I'm just not such an advanced Baker yet suicide I decided to use just the back of the spoon which is also fine and then I set it aside once it's like really even actually ended up using my own hand and just like press down with my hand that helped batter than the spoon that's why it's so smooth no so yeah just use the back of your hand now we're going to make the top right oh it's so good so I bought organic chocolate buds and vegan chocolate I use about a cup of these baths combined together with two tablespoons of almond butter and I'm going to send it to microwave and combine it once in a while I put it for one minute in 30 seconds and then I mixed it up and put it for another 30 seconds and that's what I got perfectly smooth and ready to be a piece of my cake so I'm going to be careful because the plate is really hot once you pull it out of the microwave so protect yourself by using towel then just pour the chocolate on top and even it out with a spoon and it looks beautiful love it I also actually put some salt on top some sea salt you see it even right now we can see there's pieces of sea salt once it's freezing for about 30 seconds I decided to make a juice and it's wanted to share with you these are the ingredients in my juice and it ends up being carrot ginger apple orange and celery and also lemon juice yeah love drinking juices so after about 30 minutes I was able to finally slice it and give it a try it's beautiful and it's so good it's delicious I can't believe that such an amazing thing can be vegan and sweet and no sugar I know that agave syrup is not ideal I mean it's still sugary right but as long as I don't use canned sugar I'm very satisfied I'll look at it you know you can still see chunks of sea salt on tap and sea salt actually balance the taste out way better so I highly recommend you put some salt and taps it's not too sweet it's delicious my husband is loving it especially with that part all right have a good one guys hope you enjoyed it", "KMw8vdnB2R4": "dark chocolate homemade truffles are super easy to make and you can do a really simple vegan swap use coconut oil it adds a really really nice flavor I have a quarter cup coconut oil here I'm using virgin coconut oil adding it to 8 ounces of melted dark chocolate that's 70% or more to that add 3 tablespoons of water teaspoon of vanilla extract hmm and a pinch of sea salt give this a stir until everything is nice and combined it already smells amazing traditionally truffles are made using heavy cream so the coconut oil is a really nice vegan swab this is looking at beautiful nice and silky and smooth so pour this into an 8 inch baking dish this just makes it easier to make scoops out of than say a bowl it also helps it chill a little bit faster make sure we get all the bits up okay transfer this to the refrigerator until it's fully chill which will be about two hours make sure is nice and chilled looking great now let's make our little scoops an ice cream scoop makes this really simple you can also use teaspoon measures now the trick here is to not over heat the chocolate and if your chocolate begins to get a little soft you could always throw it back in the refrigerator and as if you needed any more reason to reach for dark chocolate it's incredibly heart-healthy dark chocolate can help raise good cholesterol and help lower your blood pressure try to stick to a 1 ounce serving per day now the fun part dressing them up I have 4 toppings chopped pistachios chopped almonds toasted coconut flake and plain ol cocoa powder now your hands will get a little bit messy here sometimes helps to put a little bit of cocoa powder on them you can also create a really beautiful ombre effect with different types of cocoa powder you can use a milk chocolate cocoa powder a natural cocoa powder I'm using a Dutch processed one here I think that's enough for the cocoa powder let me just rinse my hands and we'll do the rest so I really love using toasted coconut flake here because it adds a nice crunchy texture nice toasted flavor helps bring out the coconut oil one more of these so I'm using Blanche chopped almonds here but if you happen to have access to marcona almonds which are really delicious Spanish almond definitely seek those out it has a really nice salty balance almost extra almond D flavor chocolate and pistachios can't think of a better combination try through this tray to the fridge until the chocolate is nice and chilled again probably about 10 minutes so great transfer a few to a plate these are great to enjoy with friends family also make a wonderful gift now which one to try I think I'm going to go for the almond hard to decide which one to try oh yeah Richard chocolaty this will satisfy any sweeter you", "Pt8E-HceRv0": "today Kevin and I are be trying three limited-edition these are Tony's chuckle only chocolate bars they are a massive chocolate beverage they're very heavy they're it's very hard to read the labels this one is a white chocolate bar with turmeric and chive this one is a milk chocolate bar with fresh thyme and sorry a milk chocolate honeycomb bar with fresh thyme one the dark chocolate chili Ferb's pink pepper bar so the the two on the ends these two we bought at fresh market they were $4 each the one in the middle at the time that I bought the other two the Fresh Market did not have it so I ordered it from Amazon so that I could have all three of the limited edition bars and it was $5.99 from Amazon so I didn't pay too additional dollars from Amazon but I get to drop bars so I'm satisfied so this is it says our limited edition white chocolate bar with turmeric and chai is a wonderful a creamy bar inspired by Asia oh but there's more inside than a great harmony of exotic flavors turmeric gives the chocolate a bright yellow hue zing our vision is 100% slavery chocolate not just our chocolate that all chocolate worldwide wanna join our mission check the inside of this wrapper it's made in Belgium six servings per bar one six thirty grams is 170 calories so and it has a fancy gold wrapper and it does says share our chocolate share our story on the inside and the pillow there call their whole goal is to make chocolate slavery oh wow this is definitely a different oh then what I am accustomed to from tones with white chocolate but pretty much anything you put in there yes so this yeah so white chocolate turmeric in chai it also has grated coconut and it also has cardamom cinnamon and ginger oh no it's a that makes it sound like it's Christmas kind of a thing it's so thick it's hard to break I feel like that I get more of a white chocolate coming through doesn't got Wolf's flavors here in there right mmm I mean it's someone I'm a bottle Tom but it's okay like it not for you yeah it's I don't think it's bad it's owned by a choco bar but it's not one that I would get again and I think it's the that tumbler yeah it's definitely a different one yeah it's it's not the time because I like actually like chai tea I don't think it's the chai I think it's the turmeric they and I do like the the smoothness of the white chocolate that's nice there the white part that's a really good point and I did get pieces of that coconut that it mentioned a little yeah a little piece of but it's just not for me either so it's not bad or anything it's not off-putting it's just not one that I would choose again yeah it's not like a smooth crispy honeycombs and fresh thyme and herbal notes to this limited edition milk chocolate bar or at least that's how chefs would describe it it's definitely a special bar that we quite simply describe as delicious so this is a Belgian Fairtrade milk chocolate with honeycomb breeze dry thyme and sea salt oh wow chunks of it and they're distributed at a Portland Oregon it's www.amazon.com shopping that is so different you know you've done the the flavoring chocolate no let me just having that flavor Italy yeah that time I am used to having that in like at a BM when you go to up to an Italian restaurant and you get the bread or we've had chips with times you know what is that earlier I think it works a lot sea salt oh no I got the salt at the end it's just for me that's a who's best point to have it is at the very end I don't really get a really good strong like honeycomb kind Chris I didn't I got the texture of the making setting really but I do you taste the milk chocolate and the time that time is more powerful than anything and for me it works it really I'm just shocked that that works so well in that it's good so again it's not one out I like it better than the first one I like much but it's still not one I would go and this one is gonna be a dark chocolate tech or two ways this limited edition is a bold stunner chili fudge and pink pepper infer 51% dark chocolate see Belgian fair trade dark chocolate with fetch with chili flavor and pink pepper it has elderberry concentrate okay this one [Applause] nothing I tell you what you're going to take your time eating these just because it's gonna chuck it it's gonna take you a minute to take a bite there has a performance I like the pepper it's different mm-hmm it's like literally eating pepper on camera like a peppercorns yes that is I like that though it works it's different we were watching a show a chopped episode not that long ago when it was they were making a dessert and one of the judges said you need to add some pepper to that to that dessert and I wondered how that would taste it actually is really really good in that dessert yeah I mean I would eat it again but oh you don't like it oh wow I do I think it works I like the dark dropped off the dark chocolate has a really good flavor it's a good a little bite to it a little dryness to it but it's still a really good dark chocolate it's not it was only 51% dark chocolate so it's not a super it does dry your mouth believe it or not but yeah it's not a bitter I don't think discipline but just what you'd expect a little bit more but I do like that pepper I my favorite though is the one with the time the milk chocolate and the time Dennis it's just so different it's it's not it's very unexpected for me the flavor combination but it works um and then my second wouldn't be the pepper I think I like the pepper in the dark chocolate I just did not care for the turmeric chili white chocolate one I would not get that one again I don't know why because I wouldn't buy any of these you would again well they're limited edition I don't know how long they will be out so if you're interested in any of these if I make you curious about how the flavor combinations are then I you're able to find them like I said we found them at Fresh Market it's not something these aren't chocolate bars that you see everywhere you go so usually they're in more expensive grocery stores is where you usually especially stores yeah so I'll hope you can find them in your area all have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "B5kB1zPvk2g": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "RaDyCvbjxsM": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying some good and gather bars these are a target Miranda bar they were 429 each I have two of the just the net bars this is the almonds and coconut and this is almonds peanuts and sea salt with cocoa drizzle and that is a fruit and nut bars - the almonds cranberries and macadamia nuts so we're gonna start with this there is a place to event like this have it your cabinet or if you're like me you tear this up the top like that and then you can just grab it out like that I like to tear the tops off my boxes even when they don't have the perforation I tear the tops off so you get four bars yeah and therefore you only get four of those the last set we tried so these are almonds and coconut bars made with simple ingredients very low sodium which one pressed a lot of you excellent source of fiber there are seven grams of fiber per bar these are all gluten-free four servings per container because there's four bars one bar 40 grams it's 200 calories don't have a big boy yeah it's very sticky dad do you get an eyeful for Germany I love it that you can taste the almonds hmm mm-hmm and dessert coconut the ingredients yes yeah well you know what that's good that you said that though because you knew without listen to what I was saying you knew what was then another what that's what you can heist in this the almond and the governor mm-hmm but that's what this is good yes if you stay tuned to the end of the video I know a lot of people cut out before them but if you watch to the end of the video I always post a picture at the end but I also post the nutritional information in the ingredients you will see that there are very very few ingredients in this in this bar yeah it's actually very I don't have one it's very impressive the ingredients in here but almonds is the number one ingredient almonds dried unsweetened coconut is the second area and those are the two things that you taste in this bar now what's the sticky part if you have trouble with your teeth because some people do I know people wonder why didn't you say that but some people I can't have chewy things hard things this is a harder chewier bone what do you think what happened if you're you stuck into my correct life a second might soften up a bit it might help but I've never stuck a more like this in the microwave but I would skip this one if you have trouble with your teeth because it's marriage mm-hmm I'm so high to take a bite of that may not be had out dentures that's what I don't follow okay I mean I might be able to deal with have this purse I don't know but it seems like that would be pretty tough yeah I would think that would be because I just know I had to get a hold of it oh yeah yeah so this one is also a net bar it's also made with simple ingredients low sodium excellent excellent source of fiber it has six grams of protein it's the almonds peanuts and sea salt with cocoa drizzle and it's 190 calories that was much easier mm-hmm it's not animal salt look something nut in there oh yeah tasty nuts do you know it's amazing how much flavor that peanut ass mm-hmm it's a good it's a good ball that is delicious I really like the flavor of the coconut and almond mm-hmm I mean not coz yeah coconut Normand I really like that flavor but I like this even better because these peanuts I'm a I'm a peanut fanatic and so the addition of the peanuts and I like the that cocoa I like the drizzle on the bottom it reminds you kind of a pecan bar that's really it would remind you have a few econ bars then I would compare the price of what you normally buy to the price of these and if they're close you should give these a try cuz oh that's really good they're really gonna actually like the texture and stuff of those better too and it's 10 fewer calories okay so this is the only one that is a fruit and network because it has cranberries in it so yes it has almonds cranberries and macadamia nut it's made with simple ingredients very low sodium it says excellent source of antioxidant vitamins A C and E it has 4 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber it is a 1 190 calories it's sticky you out the first one yeah I'm gonna pulled out your body heat warms up it softens it a bit injury ended up is pretty tough to bite I like the addition of the cranberry it has a little tartness to thank you that is also a very good Martin oh is it good I love them we're good but the peanut butter the peanut one I mean the peanut is my favorite monster it has the best flavor of all three although all of them like we said are all they're all top-notch as far as flavor goes but this would be the overall favorite for texture and the ease to eat it's so easy to eat and it snaps off you're not worried about your teeth and the other two I would have to take off a point because they are so hard on your teeth to print up so I will keep these bars I won't give them away it's not because I like them a lot but I just need to remember that when I get one of these hold on your hand for them yeah and just know that it's gonna take you a little bit more time which is a good thing you know taking more time but it's funny these two were 190 even with the addition of those cranberries it was still only 190 calories in the one with the coconut was the only one that was too much and you know I love coconut that's probably my least favorite one they're all good but one had out of the three that's not least they were those really Oh cuz I really liked the cranberries like well I was like the cranberries too it's it's a hard decision between these two because they're its first texture there exactly this but I really do like the flavor of that coconut and I would probably choose the coconut before that I don't really but just I mean just yes but if you could only afford one you're definitely trouble with the peanuts because I think you'll really like the flavor that the peanuts brings to it so I hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "z1dLt9Nq12c": "today Kevin and I are gonna try three new to us these are popcorn Buster clusters these are buy popcorn clusters they're about Fisher

popcorn dipped in salt it cost Oh oh this is almond okay so peanut dipped in peanut butter almond dipped in milk chocolate dipped in salt to car oh that's it it's not exactly pecans it's not exactly

almonds you can really taste those almonds the chocolate is good it's not a really super sweet chocolate yeah it's very very good mm-hmm yeah I like those a lot and you know what you can grab a handful I was thinking you get it says ten 450 calories I was singing Tim yeah that's not many I think Tim is actually a pretty good number because they're pretty good size your peanut butter peanut free ten for her give up the size of a nickel or a quarter bigger in Sapporo bad mm-hmm no I like that do honestly mm-hmm I really do the peanut butter is a it's a it's a good peanut butter it reminds me of those it's the texture but it reminds me of this this I hate to say cuz it might turn people off is really is good a PB - I like PB - oh he does I know you know it reminds me of that it reminds me of like not a Jeff but a lower fat peanut butter and it's probably not at all that's just what it remember it's excellent that way it has a good good spend on you miss all that the greasiness right field that's why I'm saying you always build yeah that's why I'm saying I guess a lower fat is because if you don't get that oily and it's not overly sweet I think a lot of peanut butters you don't realize how sweet they are until you've gone to something like PB 2 and it really is those are good what are you hoping to gain from having never there's no more oh okay oh come on peanut Nam okay hmm I don't know definitely the caramel salt at home definitely the caramel would be my favorite just because it's really really sick sweet and of course I'm gonna pick the one that's the most syrupy suede well I tell you I would have picked I would put the UM one above the peanut butter except that chocolates not sweet it's not a sweet chocolate it leans towards the bitter side it's not better but it is leaning that way it was sweeter that would have been in place of P but over the last uh I'll give you that I'll probably say that's probably melt or two I mean really these are these are about equal to me I would definitely but anyway these were in the snacky step in Walt Walmart like in the with the peanut staff right way back on the wall that's too cool no we bought these is the one in Lexington oh yeah I know but they said a different Walmart normally shop I'm almost full with the mess yeah well it's not so but we had never seen them before so I thought that were cool so anyway hopefully you enjoyed getting to see them too and thanks for watching", "XQP_6wU-wnU": "- Hey you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious\nhomemade dishes to share with your family and friends. Today, one of my favorite\ncookies: chocolate chip oatmeal. Crisp on the outside, chewy\non the inside, chocolate, big hit of salt, the works,\noh my gosh, let's get started. I'm so excited for this recipe because I've been craving oatmeal cookies. These cookies are for me. I will be sharing most of them, but I'll be having the first few. And while I'm at it, I'm\ntrying one variation where I add big flakes of sea salt on top. Very similar to my peanut\nbutter chocolate chip cookie which is another favorite of mine, which I might have to make\nright after this I don't know. I'm in a cookie mode. (playful music) First off, we're whisking\none cup of flour along with 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda, but I wanna show you something first. I'm actually gonna reach into my bag, level off a cup of flour, and let's see what it weights at. Oh my God, you saw I didn't\npack anything in there, that's 166 grams, one cup of flour is more like 120 so I'm gonna remove some away. See all this in here, all this flour in here is extra. Watch this. If you're only using\ncups to measure flour, fluff it up, you could spoon it in, I have a whole video on this, you can click up here\nfor how to measure flour. It is the most common and\ndrastic mistake people will make because cups are not the\nbest for measuring weight. That's all I'm gonna say about that. 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda. Whisk it up. You could sift it if you\nwant, but we don't need to. Set it aside, and now for\nthe butter sugar situation. The bowl of a stand mixer\nfitted with a paddle attachment, I'm adding in 1/2 of a\ncup of unsalted butter at room temperature. Cream it up. (whirring noise) 1/2 a teaspoon of salt A 1/3 of a cup or about 66\ngrams of granulated sugar. And then 2/3 of a cup, 1, 2, (whirring noise) of light brown sugar, and\nthen pack it in a bit. It's gonna be about 140 grams,\nmaybe 133.333, who's to say. Scrape that bowl down,\nbutter really hardened up. (whirring noise) Mix it all up until\nit's totally homogenous. We're gonna use one room\ntemperature egg for this recipe, so crack it into a bowl just to be safe. Now go back to mixing on low. Add in two teaspoons of a nice vanilla and one egg. It is important for the\ningredients to be room temperature so don't use cold ingredients. Once that egg is all mixed in, we're gonna add the\nflour, so just dump it in. I started incorporating the\nflour in just a little bit by hand before I mix it so there's not a big pool of butter, sugar, eggs at the bottom. Mix it on low until it's combined. (whirring noise) That's just combined. Alright, now it's time for the oats, I'm not gonna weigh them out\ncause it's not as crucial. 1 1/2 cups of old-fashioned oats. Unlike quick oats, these\nwill keep their shape and really absorb the\nbutter and kind of crisp up and give you a delightful texture. And of course, one cup of chocolate chips, I'm using semisweet but if you love bittersweet,\nthat is an option as well. I'm just gonna stir\nthis in ever so gently. (whirring noise) I can finish the rest off by\nhand so I have total control. If you're using the last of\nyour chocolate chips by the way, save some for the very end of this recipe because you wanna stick them on top for some nice pretty cookies if you care about that sort of thing. They're not gonna taste different but it's nice to have some\nclean chocolate chips on top. So right now I'm just using\nmy metal handled spatula to finish mixing in any random\noats and chocolate chips. You could finish this\noff in the stand mixer, I'm finishing it off by\nhand, just so I have control and can really distribute\nthe chocolate chips, and maybe get a little bit of exercise. Gotta take every chance you can get. You could bake this now\nbut I'm gonna cover it and pop it into the fridge so it can chill for about an hour. Chilling the dough is it's gonna let the cookie hold its shape a bit better and spread out less in the oven and it also helps the\nflavors come together. Like when you have a soup or something, it's better the next day cause the flavors kind of\ncame together in the fridge. It's actually the same for a cookie. So cover and in to the fridge you go. My dough's been chilling for\na little bit over an hour so it's time to get scoopin' and abakin'. Alright so we're gonna need about two tablespoons per cookie. This is a little bit larger\nso I'm not gonna overfill it. I have a ton of these ice cream scoopers and there's various sizes\nand they're not all labeled, so I'll literally use\na tablespoon of water to carefully spoon it in,\nsee how much they hold. This is an appropriate\nsize for the cookie dough. Give it a quick roll. On to the baking sheet, and\nthey will be spreading out, so you do need to give\nthem a little bit of space. We'll take two inches per cookie. I can feel the oats in my\nhand when I roll the cookies, and I love it because\nmy favorite is cookies with some texture and\nbite and these have that. But they're still chewy in the middle, so they have a little bit\nof something for everybody, in my humble opinion. If you want a delicious\ncookie recipe with no baking, try my no-bake cookie recipe, it has oats, peanut butter, chocolate. They're addictively amazing. I think I might need to\nwhip a batch up pretty soon. One of the things I love\nabout making cookie dough is that you can bake up\nhowever much you want and then save the rest in the\nfridge or freezer for later, so when someone is\nrequesting a midnight snack, you can just go downstairs and say, \"Okay, be back in a jiffy.\" My first batch is ready for\nthe oven but before they go in, I'm going to stick just a couple\nof chocolate chips on top, and they're not covered\nin any cookie dough, so you're gonna have nice visual. I'm also gonna try it with a little bit of sea\nsalt sprinkled on top. Mmm, add some sea salt. These amazing cookies are\ngonna go into the oven at 375 for eight to 10 minutes. (howling) That's Butch saying, \"Cookie\" \"crisp.\" (laughs) (beep) Anyways, into the oven at\n375 for eight to 10 minutes. They will not be baked\nall the way through, like most cookies they\nhave to hang out here, set up, and then you can handle them. But like if you pull them out of the oven and try and eat them right away, you're gonna be scalding your mouth and they're gonna fall apart. Word for the wise. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my cookie playlist, it has all my favorite cookies including those peanut butter\nchocolate chip ones I talked about at the beginning of the video. Now it is time for a bite. (crunching) The crunch. Oh my God, I love the\ncrunch on the outside. By the way, the sea salt ones\nare actually amazing too. I tried those out and I loved the salt and chocolate mixing together.

classic cake I like my classic cakes I love my coconut cake it is so creamy and heavenly and just so fluffy and there's pastry cream between the layers it's actually easy to make just a few steps because we're making frost and we're making cake batter and we're making the pastry cream let's get to it it is so good we'll begin by greasing two cake pans with some butter and then just fit some parchment paper to the bottom of the pans and I just greased the parchment paper and lightly flour both pans getting rid of any excess to start off the batter I'm just cracking 6 eggs and adding the whites only I'll still keep four of the egg yolks for later when I make the pastry cream then I'm adding a cup of whole milk a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and then whisk until fully combined to a large mixing bowl I'm just preparing the dry ingredients now you want to add two and 1/4 cups of cake flour to the bowl now if you're like me and you only ever have all-purpose flour in your kitchen no worries all you have to do is for every cup of all-purpose flour replace two tablespoons of it with two tablespoons of cornstarch and that's it you have cake flour then I'm adding 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar and 4 teaspoons of baking powder I always use aluminum free baking powder then a teaspoon of salt goes in and give it a mix I'm just cutting up some softened butter here and then I'm going to add that straight into the bowl I'm going to use a spatula next to help incorporate the butter before using a mixer on low speed to completely combine everything together scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time then I'm adding in half of the wet ingredients mixing that in on medium speed until incorporated and then adding in the remainder of the wet ingredients and mixing that in for about another minute I like to add in about three to four ounces of unsweetened coconut flakes and then gently fold that right in to the airy cake batter add the batter evenly into both cake pans and then stick it into the oven that's already been preheated to 350 degrees it'll take about 27 to 30 minutes or until fork poked into it comes out clean well the cake is baking in the oven in the meantime we are going to start making the pastry cream that's going to go between the layers a nice coconut pastry cream I'm adding 3/4 of a cup of coconut milk to a saucepan which is nothing more than the result of coconut flakes that have steeped in water and given all their coconut flavor than 3/4 of a cup of whole milk and then 1/2 of a vanilla bean sliced and scraped to get all those vanilla seeds and just throw that right in give it a whisk and heat it on low place 1/3 of a cup of sugar to a bowl and add in the reserved egg yolks and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch going to give it a whisk until it forms a paste and then use an electric mixer while adding in the hot milk mixture little by little then add it all back into the saucepan and whisk over medium heat until it starts thickening and bubbling and you have your custard and place some plastic wrap up against the custard so that it doesn't form a skin and cool it in the fridge or freezer so now that the cakes are ready we are just going to let them cool at room temp for about 10 minutes before I flip them over onto a cooling rack to get completely cool in the meantime let's get to the frosting we're starting out with two sticks of softened butter and two teaspoons of vanilla then 7 cups of powdered sugar 7 tablespoons of whole milk and 1/4 a teaspoon of sea salt give it a mix until fluffy and just very quickly toasting up 3 ounces of coconut flakes for the frosting over medium-low heat while continually tossing them around until they just start to turn golden now I'm going to make the pastry cream filling so what we're going to do is we're going to take that custard that we made it's cooled right in here and I'm just going to add some heavy cream to it and it's just going to make a nice and airy and beautiful at the custard and 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream to a bowl and give it a mix until it's nice and airy so before I put my layers of cake onto the cake stand I put some parchment paper around the edge of the cake stand so that when I put my cake on there and start frosting it it doesn't make a mess because I can just easily remove the parchment paper after I've frosted it and it will be perfectly clean and the frosting acts is a glue that binds these pieces of paper together cut the cakes evenly in half and layer the slices with the custard not going all the way to the edges then frost the entire surface of the cake with the buttercream frosting and sprinkle on some of that toasted coconut and it is ready for me to consume and enjoy and you can just see the cream running through the layers and it's so that custard oh my goodness a tickety's I got it hmm I don't know what to say other than you need to be making this cake like now tonight maybe go get the ingredients go on my website honest and tasty the recipes also down below in my description box but if you go to my website you will also find other cake recipes from before I started making videos anyway I hope you

Harding for sending us a big package of Tony's chocol only products from Holland disease are now available in the UK although I'm not saying about these two flavors this video we've got to do check out the other ones because I go into the bit more detail about the overall information on these products basically they're high-end premium brand I want to get rid of slavery in chocolate and they look really nice and they are awesome so this first one is dark milk basically 51% with almond and sea salt there should be like a salted caramel sort of sweet nut so be not the only thing I don't like about them which I have said in the other videos is the foil to fit it's thin and because it's all sealed together at the edges it makes it a bit of a nightmare to get into because it will rip and then it's hard to just have to get like shiver okay you can see the chunks of almond in there let's give it a go mmm very rich yeah quite dark tasting slightly better in that regard lovely texture bright snappiness it's quite thick I'm not quite a salty as the salted caramel but these still goes really well they're not and chocolate hmm really good I remember I gave just a dark milk on its own well since you sort of taste a bit stronger and dough if it is that's not what 51% plays a bit darker than that I like that not my favourite over the buzzer pad I give that high four stars [Music] when I was under bit downbeat there still an excellent score for an excellent bit chocolate right this next one really excited s it's again 51% and this is pecan and coconut but don't know any further details the mount rate on this one so I'm expecting a bit more jam-packed ok crack and open this one I see a little bit of pecan nut but not much else going on in there let's go yeah probably gonna be pretty similar to lost Oh coconut foam is really nice really strong so it's got quite small piece of coconut home which is nice very interesting combination then we have ever had anything that is pecan and coconut before coconut come through really nicely so I'm doing a bounty vibe but a lot more intense because of that rich chocolate again I put in a similar pace to the previous bar I just tried the salt sea salt an almond it's nice but a bit too rich but for me prefer a milky chocolate I give that one four stars [Music] but has got a really nice texture sometimes coconut can get stuck in your teeth and whatnot but it is quite nice it's like a quite a sugary coconut so it has a nice bite and crunches down nicely check these guys are on Instagram guys they've got a lovely account thank you for watching our channel if you're new please subscribe for more we've got we're basically reviewing like twelve Tony's chocolate only bars in the last saw six weeks or saying so it's been an intense period right cheers guys we'll see it a little later guys repeat [Applause] [Music]", "fPfdBLUmLmg": "today I'm making one of my favorite no-bake desserts dark chocolate covered coconut bites with sea salt you are gonna wanna make this I'll show you how I have 14 ounces of shredded sweetened coconut and to that I'm going to add a can of sweetened condensed milk some vanilla extract I came up with this recipe because I love almond joys and mounds bars so this is kind of my take on it and my mom loves coconut and dark chocolate and sea salt and she's gluten free so she can't have cookies and cakes unless they're gluten free so whenever I'm with her I always make her some some version of this this looks thoroughly incorporated now time to assemble I've sheet tray lined with parchment and this prevents the balls from sticking tiny ice cream scoop scoop kind of flatten it and then and roll and put it on the sheet tray I'm going to continue to do this but my hands are going to get stickier and stickier so I have this bowl of water I can just dip my hands into the water and continue to roll let's do it okay now that I have my balls rolled I'm going to place them in the fridge to chill up a little bit before I add the almonds I have my children's I'm going to melt my dark chocolate I have 12 ounces of dark chocolate that I've chopped up I'm putting them in this double boiler I want the water barely simmering I do not want it boiling then that's called a double boiler you don't want it boiling you want it simmering to the chocolate I'm adding some coconut oil while my chocolate melts I'm going to start stuffing my little bites with my toasted almonds I've already roasted my almonds you can do it in the oven or in a dry saute pan you just want to stuff it into the bowl lovely and roll it back up this is a lot easier when they're chilled if you try and do it immediately after I first rolled them it'll just fall apart it's way too sticky Oh so my balls are rolled and usually I pop them back in the fridge just firm up a little bit but these feel pretty chilled so I think they're gonna be alright I'm gonna check on my chocolate just give it a little stir I add coconut oil to my chocolate because it helps with the coating process it also adds a little extra coconut flavor and it just makes it so gorgeous and shiny a fork you're going to grab a bite place it in the chocolate and using the spatula kind of push the chocolate over and then push it onto the fork and tap any extra chocolate off of it and place it back down on the tray last one now to finish these off I'm going to put a little flaky sea salt on top as I like chocolate and salt they're very very sweet because of the coconut and sweetened condensed milk so the salt kind of cuts the sweetness I'm just going to sprinkle it on top there we go I'm going to pop them in the fridge just until they Harden 15 20 minutes and then I can take a bite wow they're done they chilled they're ready to go one of my favorite no baked desserts my dark chocolate and coconut covered lights with sea salt hope you make it", "dnJHHN-y-yE": "today Kevin and I have three chocolate candies to try these are all from Pearson's and they were all from Cracker Barrel they were a dollar twenty nine eight so not change yeah I think that's a little expensive but Cracker Barrel is very expensive on their candy they they just are and these are all Pearson's bun I don't know why they're called bun but that's what they're called Pearson's but I have the new sea salt caramel and I have vanilla and maple now I think we should try vanilla first okay we probably the cleanest yeah that's what I'm thinking these are all gluten-free which I know people care about real milk chocolate Virginia peanuts and nougat this is 240 calories you want to open them generous 40 calories let me see I'm crushed wanna see the calories to 40 and ah okay this is the only one that's different so I'll say that we're gonna be no motor these are the maple and the vanilla are about 240 and it's the vanilla but anyway it smells oh I've got chromosome here yeah we six that you gotta be careful I'm sorry it smells really good lots of peanuts pop on top of that Oh yum yummy you know I borrowed it from you get mostly a chocolate peanut flavor like a charger or a peanut mm-hmm but that that white part is like a creamy oh my god no no it's thick like a egg says it's like a york peppermint pattie filling it's that yeah but it's like this if you never had one though that will mean thing to you but it's it's kind of thick but it's not as thick like a caramel or anything but it's not as thin as like a you know frosting it's more of a cream candy kind of feel exactly but it's good it's dull there's no chocolate yeah that's a really good it really is very good and it's full of nuts mm-hmm oh you're really strong what they say but now you get that I'm wondering though if once we've tried the other two if that will be more of vanilla compared to the other two I think of an elephant numbers lack of other flavors right so that'll be different from these that's what I exactly know I'm thinking of it as like yeah it'll be the lack of do you want to try this he saw it caramel next that's five whatever okay this one's new see talk Horowitz is new I don't know how long we put out yes this one it's 250 calories it's only 10 more power was a little tougher because it has caramel on its the white part in the bottom and this one has caramel on the bottom Wow it's got a lock on one soon a pad notice nom nice and let him take the first bite I was freeing up space for you that is a really good thick caramel it's not runny caramel I like that it's got a again you get mostly that chocolate peanut flavor at first then once you start actually eating it you get that caramel flavor really it's a decent it is a good caramel but I won't be honest I like the vanilla because it I like the peanut flavor and it has it seemed seemed to have more peanuts than that caramel yeah I think it was the lack of flavor in the vanilla that maybe that made the peanuts taste stronger right caramel kind of overrides the peanuts a little bit it's good but I think I like them in a little better how's it feel to make one's really going overrun okay make real milk chocolate Virginia peanuts and looks the same this one looks a little more on man instead of it being white on the bottom this was like an off-white like a like a cream color on the bottom hmm do you get mobile mm-hmm a little bit once I swallow so he's just you know what I did to just last no you're right yeah the maples not super strong maple it's kind of there once you've eaten it mm-hmm you can kind of taste the maple syrup a flavor mm-hmm it's good and sweet though it's berries and one thing I like about these is the amount of peanuts and chocolate it's really really good I still think I like to know I'm better and I like to like the vanilla one better I like I think we lost the net we did oh I like the crispness of the chocolate too it has a like a hard casing but not too hard you know those are really good and I would have never thought they would have been that good but they really are not something I would pay $1 29 for all the time but if I were in Cracker Barrell eating or wherever in saw these and someone asked me I would say yes those are really really good candy bars there needs talking stuff for to know one person's time it would be because it's a special treat it's not something that somebody's gonna buy all the time that's a really good idea yeah throw a birthday present you know just a little sweet they could have the present or something well let's say one more thing I still think that's a little expensive for a piece of candy these are made in st. Paul Minnesota that's interesting so yeah so I know like I know that ain't her first thing and we pray never bothers me - yeah they're too expensive so that would be a good stocking stuffer to give there yeah cuz we're used to and they were just cheap but we're used to buying candy bars for 90 cents or something like that before it always keeping really good lucky yeah yeah or bottom in the big pack or even cheaper yeah so I am you can buy these by the box can't you Cracker Barrel did not I believe the head to have some of them in the box yeah so it just depends I guess if they've taken them out of the box or not I'm sure if you if you see them stocked up they would probably sell you a whole box that it probably would be a lot cheaper so anyway hopefully you enjoyed this I know we did it was very very sweet and thanks for watching", "qgRmzBYnUhI": "today given an hour going to be trying three new Kashi chewy nut butter bars I have the salted chocolate chunk the coconut cashew macaroon almonds tikrit of these were 348 a box at Walmart there is another variety that we could not find but for 340 a box I told Kevin I said we'll just try what we have that's a lot of ours to get through and five bars of the box yeah for that money and I do have to say that the two of these had dollar off coupons oh that's also so so you can't get them for a dollar all but you if you happen to find another coupon that's right yeah I can tell this one you have one I think they all have one but only two of them actually had to keep off lock but I just I didn't realize it rocks it did have a keep on it right nice one ah we've done that too if we're buying the product anyway and then you just get one and use it with what you kiss because if you're gonna be buying it's not like you're cheating or anything okay these are gluten-free Fairtrade certified non-gmo they're made with or they made all made with almonds better me no this one's cashew that's what's almond butter so this one doesn't say it's fair trade certified either Oh more so more okay but they're all gluten-free gluten-free okay I'll just whatever that teabag is transitional certified I have no idea what that meant at all never seen that before okay I'll read you about this one this is the salted chocolate chunk one bars 150 calories that might be the same for all I'm not sure what is it fair 51 51 okay they're all I can act a what transitional circuit says it right there it says these bars are not organic they're certified transitional and initiative we helped create to support farmers transitioning their conventional farm lands you organic why do they need support well farmers have to go through a three-year transition period to be able to apply for USDA Organic certification that's three years of implementing organic practices on their land without a return on their investment immediately so they're less motivated to make the change so these are the people basically that are going organic but there's a three-year gap that before they can say they're organic so they're organic without being organic that's understandable they would need help yeah so that's cool yeah really nice okay so Salter the Chocolate Chunk and it says more about that too if you get up they look good big chunky it's not as thick as I was hoping it nice smell good there we go there's quite a bit of stuff on top going on just bite it it's a very soft more -

macaroon all day long I think how we do that - yeah yeah the salted chocolate salted chocolate chunk which is in here yeah I thought I said calm what does it it says salted chocolate no salted chocolate but it tastes like home it does taste like it very much tastes like I think it's the nut butter whatever that nut butter is I think it it does taste like caramel and if you've tried these you can let us stop you feel that way too because if you hadn't told me what that wasn't I would think it was called it did yeah cuz it really does taste like hollow so anyway my favorite is that is the coconut castanet definitely a very close second would be the salted yes it would be further how I wouldn't get this one again at all oh yeah but I wouldn't bother right yeah yeah we'll definitely eat them enough um so I hope you enjoyed the review I'm gonna have a picture of all three of these at the end for you and thanks for watching [Music]", "ZKpTPgneQyc": "hi I'm dr. Liz Carter from dr. Liz Carter calm and new leaf natural medicine and today I just wanted to share with you a little bit about chocolate how to pick it out so it's a great choice for you and a little bit about the health benefits I recently wrote a blog post about a chocolate coconut pudding recipe that I came up with and I wanted to highlight some of the health benefits that I talked about in that recipe for you so first off chocolate helps to reduce cortisol levels which is that stress hormone we've all heard about right it's the one that can keep us up at night make us feel really wired and anxious and accumulate kind of weight around our abdomen so chocolate eating chocolate will help decrease that which is lovely it can also help decrease blood pressure and helps with insulin sensitivity so what that means is insulin is a molecule that helps to shuttle blood sugar into your cells so it essentially makes the blood sugar useful to you so the better your insulin works the better your blood sugar will respond once you eat so chocolate will help to increase that sensitivity for you which is great it's also wonderful for memory it's been shown chocolate has been shown to increase circulation to an area in your brain called the hippocampus which is wonderful for long term memory and also affects spatial relations so it's great for that those are just a few of the benefits of chocolate oh yeah and at boosts serotonin which is our happy kind of feel good mood chemical so yeah so that's why we feel so great when we eat chocolate I wanted to run you through how I pick out a chocolate bar so you get the most bang for your buck and the biggest benefit out of eating chocolate when you when you get to have some in your diet let me flip this around I'll show you some bars okay so these are my two favorite brands of chocolate that I found so far we've got Theo on the left and equal exchange on the right they're both lovely and I'll run you through what I look for in inch and in each brand here so you can see that they're clearly labeled organic both of them they have the USDA Organic seal here which is just a nice confirmatory you can see they're both dark chocolate so we've got 70 at dark here and 71 percent dark on the Equal Exchange the Equal Exchange is just a straight up dark chocolate whereas the Theo I got one with cherry and almond in it a few other components so we can see how the company processes fruits and nuts or other things that they like to add to chocolate so yeah let's flip these over and see these out of the way here see what we've got on the Equal Exchange ingredients and the feel so here's the ingredients section so it's great the first ingredient we see listed is chocolate right so organic chocolate liqueur and you would like to see chocolate as a first ingredient when you're buying a chocolate bar and then we've got some raw organic cane sugar the little asterisks there mean that all those ingredients are fair trade both of these companies focus on fair trade which is wonderful to know that people are getting paid a fair wage for what you're buying and we've got organic cocoa butter which is a little bit more of the fat from the cocoa bean that adds a wonderful kind of richness overall to the bar and then we've got organic unrefined whole cane sugar right so instead of raw we do have unrefined which is which is nice it's not refined sugar and then organic ground vanilla beans which is awesome right it's the full-on vanilla no extract no artificial colors or flavoring just straight-up vanilla beans so it's an ingredient list that we can read everything on we understand what it is chocolates the first ingredient there's nothing hidden in there it's really a fabulous bar and a great company and if we shift over here to see oh that's what we've got right so again the first ingredient is a cocoa bean which is lovely right chocolate is the first ingredient cane sugar so we do need a little sweetener in anything that's less than a hundred percent there will be sugar added to chocolate that's kind of how it goes because chocolate by itself is very bitter so we need that sweetness to kind of lighten it up that the higher percentage of dark chocolate the the less sugar will be in it there are some bars I've seen that are honey sweetened but they tend to have more strange additives and preservatives so they haven't quite made it onto my list of really great clean bars that I like to eat cocoa butter again for some richness and then we get to see how they've treated the cherries and almonds here so dried sour cherries right we've got on sweet and cherries sunflower oil which is actually it's not a bad oil to have in there we'll get to we'll get to some other bars here in a minute I'll show you the difference there and then a rice flour right so we've got is not wheat right it's the chosen non-allergenic flour for most people and then almonds just straight-up almonds which is wonderful right it's not they're not bleached or blanched or processed in any way we've also got a full ground vanilla bean no extracts or artificial flavors so that's that's Theo they're just lovely there locally made and she flips change and I bought a couple other brands here but I wanted to compare for you these are usually considered fairly high cut a little higher brand of chocolate right a little a little more expensive they charge a premium so you think that the ingredients would be pretty premium as well so I wanted to kind of contrast that so we've got lindt chocolate where it's it says dark chocolate here right a touch of sea salt so it's just kind of straight up chocolate with sea salt and then we've got a ghirardelli dark chocolate raspberry right so we can see we've got a raspberry filling again it is it is labeled as dark chocolate so we'll flip it over and see what we've got here okay so ingredient wise right the first ingredient here is sugar unlike the Theo and equal exchange right which were chocolate first second ingredient is chocolate and how these ingredients are listed to write the the ones that are listed in order there that's the I'm sorry that's the concentration so if sugar is the first ingredient that's going to be the highest ingredient on here so sugar is is greater than chocolate in here and we can see that per serving word about 19 grams of sugar and if we look at equal exchange right word about 11 grams of sugar and these serving sizes are pretty much are pretty equivocal between the two so there's a big difference in sugar therefore people then we've got cocoa butter right which is that chocolate fat that we want to add in and we've got milk fat that added so even though this says drop dark chocolate right that was the branding on here dark chocolate right we've got milk fat so it's something important to read on the back of the ingredients especially if you're allergic to dairy there is a lot of hidden milk in in these chocolate bars and then we've also got soy lettuce in right so the soil efes in is as it's labeled an emulsifier i prefer the theo in equal exchange they're one of the few that did not have the soy emulsifier in them there's a lot of research coming out about soy lecithin and that it's actually quite inflammatory to the GI there's a really lovely protective lining of mucus along your GI that that keeps foods from damaging it and that the multipliers like this actually strip it off so they leave your GI a lot more vulnerable to inflammation and an irritants and then we've got sea salt of course right since it's a salt chocolate and then artificial flavoring and this is probably the vanilla that's in here so that is the mint bar so the ghirardelli let's take a look at that one on the back compare ingredients right so we've got sugar again is the first ingredient not chocolate and then we've got chocolate fortunately high fructose corn syrup is next so the high fructose corn syrup right that's the most refined type of sugar possible it really spikes for blood sugar when when it's when it hits you there so not nearly as great as just the cane sugar cocoa butter right for the fat palm oil so the palm oil is a really refined type of oil so it's very inflammatory and difficult to digest we've got milk fat freeze-dried raspberry powder for the raspberries corn syrup was again very refined soy lecithin we've got the emulsifier again vegetable juice for color right so that's great they didn't add any dies or preservatives that way vanilla so we do have real vanilla and then we have potassium sorbate citric acid and tbhq which is another preservative right and then gelatin finally so even though these are labeled as dark chocolate they still have milk fat in it and you can see a lot of that aren't super related to chocolate and then the preservatives this back over so these guys you know they do have some they will have some benefits of the chocolate but just not nearly as much as these brands that are a lot more highly concentrated with an actual dark chocolate you will get a lot more of the benefit of chocolate from these brands so great thank you so much for watching I really hope this helped feel free to ask any questions if you have any and yeah go forth and find some delicious chocolate thanks take care", "MbqdpFZd5iY": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some Prairie City Bakery down-home delights these are new from Paris Prairie City Bakery I have the oat milk harmony top you know this is an apple cinnamon crumble and a chocolate almond coconut these were sent to us completely free from Prairie City Bakery we they send in some box we did a box opening they send us all kinds of sweet treats to try and we're very thankful because I had been looking for these in our area and could not find them we they also sell these gooey gooey bars and you see those around here but haven't seen the downtown dogs yet so the oval Carmelita it is the whole square is 71 grams in its 300 calories so I think that is what you would expect in something this big because that's a big square little more firm than to the gooeys yeah we do tend to fall far pretty pick them up these are the Magdeburg are made in Barton Hills Illinois and it's WWF he seemed a curry calm much different text like chewy Oh gracefully know how they're do yeah I don't know how to describe it [Music] I'm a sticky g-shock runs over those oh I like the fragrance I don't like the texture the protectors is to run it's all too hard it's hard no it's hard yeah if you don't have microwave instructional in here you put it the microwave it might help but the intention of these is normally to pick it up and eat it right there in your car on the go whatever oh you could eat this in your car yeah well you could but you it was from there it is it's hard it's very very hard I would not do that again I like the flavor of it once I've chewed on it for a little while what kind of like a life be tapping once you chewed it for a little while but I would not buy that because it's so hard it's very very hard okay I'm wondering if they're all like that or if that one was just employed no no this one is the Apple don't tell I'm try to cut apple cinnamon crumble and it's 220 calories Belem whoop softer vo yes this this one is soft physics that looks like yeah you can try to pick it up that's what I'm used to this just from touch it feels like one of those I think it's called Archer brain cookies with the little raspberry they're very soft that's what that feels like to touch give you something to compare it to though [Music] I don't get Apple don't either by Olof cinnamon what cinnamon I didn't I didn't get Apple but I love the texture of that the in the Chrome want to know yes it's it's the the texture is incredibly she's so pressed it's so different from that first one no no no way and how hard though yeah this is like this is like if you've made like Apple Cinnamon bars it has that kind of a bar texture to it um very very nice I love that crumble on top it's just perfect did you think it's anyone else good um it's it's light I thought the Apple was very light and I thought the cinnamon the only not got the cinnamon I didn't give rise when you get it but it it's a lot I just thought I might never liked apples no I got a little bit of Apple - but we don't like that very much this is the chocolate almond coconut when it's 280 calories so we're kind of all over with calories you're gonna get almonds everywhere so I'm going to open it down open these in your car so this I'm sure they have it's a chocolate it has a chocolate base it's not dipped in chocolate it's actually chocolate Ranger yeah baked in chocolate and then it has the almonds lots of like almond shavings [Music] so I'm hoping up now I get the texture that really soft coconut that's my favorite one it's good mm-hmm I didn't get the coconut until the very very end I just get the texture oh well I've actually got the flavor the the the flavor didn't come through feed on me until the very very end once I swallow them that's muscle chuckle that's why using coconut and I'm looking at it because I didn't at first when I was chewing it I didn't taste it up it out but then I swallow it I get it that the texture of that is incretin because there's lots of different textures going in you have that firmer brownie like texture on the bottom but then the almonds give it a terrific crunch and you do get the pieces of the coconut no let's give you a little chew that is so delicious that is really one I would get all the time definitely yeah because you start with chocolate and it kind of develops yes and you do taste chocolate yes you actually taste the chocolate that's really odd that would be the one I'd buy yeah that is that is the best chocolate almond coconut is absolutely the best and then the apple cinnamon yeah the other one I don't know I would not get that at all I don't I I have no idea why it's so hard I would be curious to know if they are all that hard because it was literally you saw it you saw it was crunchy crispy like crumbs went everywhere when we opened when Kevin tried to cut it it wasn't even the bad thing I wasn't even like a crispy like a brittle like we could break it it was this chewy like guy yeah like gummy cow yeah so that one's a pass but if you do see these if you like almonds and coconut you you have to try but that chocolate almond coconut because that that is absolutely delicious so thank you to Prairie City Bakery person and they says I'll have a picture Maree at the end and thanks watch it [Music]", "742bPEwjP-0": "[Music] thanks for joining me for part two and as you know from watching part one we're going to be making paleo compliant milk chocolate almond butter cups now for those who didn't see part one and you're just coming in on this video I do urge you to watch part one because it's kind of a three part recipe if you will because in the first one I made my dark chocolate peanut butter cups in this one we're doing milk chocolate almond butter cups and then in the next one part three so please subscribe and you'll get alerted to when the next one comes out we're going to be making my white chocolate matcha green tea coconut butter cups so without further ado can't wait to get started and let's get on with it so the first thing we need to do is we need to measure out eight ounces of this gorgeous cocoa butter now it looks like a giant bar of white chocolate it isn't but you need when you do buy this and if you buy it online like I do I get mine from Amazon it's organic cocoa butter but you must specify food grade at some future point I will make a fabulous inexpensive and very effective moisturizer from cocoa butter and I'll show you how to do that but this day is not today today we're concentrating on our fabulous milk chocolate almond butter cups eight ounces okay so I'm gonna melt that over my water just like we did in part one when we made the dark chocolate peanut butter cups so let's get on with that cocoa butter is completely melted and it's time to throw in all the rest of the ingredients if you wanted to make this into dark chocolate obviously you omit the coconut cream it's starting to look very milky and luscious and just glossy and gorgeous so here we go oh that's fantastic that is amazing whatever is left again if you have a mold make yourself some chocolate I'm gonna show you what this looks like close up and then we're going to start filling our cups look at that beautiful glossy milk chocolate it's stunning okay let's start filling cups I'm gonna make 12 of these almond butter cups about 1/3 1/3 of the way up because obviously you've got two more kind of layers to go okay this is just beyond gorgeous make sure that you flatten them at the end but we don't need to worry about that till we get near that point and then this can go in the freezer for about 20 minutes you can see how easy it is to make your own milk chocolate and it's a healthy milk chocolate this could harden before you get a chance to put the top layer on so obviously you just have to remelt it a little bit and that's okay okay put your chocolate which mine is already pretty much setting put that to one side and let's get on with our almond butter give it a mix first so you get the solid at the bottom now for this one I don't actually like to add anything because I think that almond butter stands alone I don't think it needs salt I don't think it needs sweetening if you want to sweeten it by all means put a little stevia into your mix and or maple syrup whichever you prefer and that's fine and if you want to put a teeny pinch of sea salt that's also fine but honestly for me nothing so just a quick mix not even vanilla just plain old almond butter for this okay for these fulfilling them you just need to put in one teaspoon in each but as a blob you don't want this to go to the ends if it does it does but you can do that on its own so here we go just one teaspoon in each and then we're going to put the lid on so they're perfectly beautifully ready to receive their little tops and then they can all go into the freezer but I'm gonna show you what they look like close okay so here is what they look like at this stage bit of a mess but gorgeous okay my chocolate is solid my milk chocolate is solid so I'm just gonna warm that up a little bit so that I can pour some on these and then we're gonna stick them in the freezer now reheating your chocolate is not going to be a problem but you have to give it a jolly good beating to get it nice and smooth so you can make those tops okay so my chocolate as you can see is gorgeous it's smooth again and we're just going to spoon that on top of our cups and we're done swirl it on and then we'll let them set in the freezer before we put them into storage container or a sandwich bag or a freezer bag it doesn't matter they freeze beautifully and you can eat them from frozen if you like I'm really really excited to hear from you all and hear which ones are gonna be your favorites once you've tried all three but for that of course we've got one more to go so they're all done I have tons of chocolate left and I'm going to make a bar of chocolate with that but here they are and they're going to go into the freezer for I'm gonna say 15 to 20 minutes they probably won't even need that long but I do because I'm going to have a cup of tea and here are those gorgeous gorgeous beauties you okay part two is completes and I can't wait to see you all again for part three which is my white chocolate March a green tea coconut butter cups and as always please

So today I thought I would share with you\na celebration cake recipe because we recently hit a 100,000 subscribers here on Youtube not super recently but it's been a while since\nI've posted so today I thought I would share one of my\nnew favorite recipes for a chocolate cake with you, now I already have a really nice chocolate cake recipe that I posted a few years ago,\nbut you know times have changed you try new recipes, you discover you like\nnew things now this recipe is just as good if not better\nthan that cake it's super fluffy, super soft, just the right\namount of chocolate and it happens to be vegan\nit's a little bit easier to make than the old recipe, which is why it has become a staple\nin my house so let's get started! Begin by adding two cups of sugar to a bowl\nI'm using Demerara but brown or regular, granulated sugar is fine\nNext, pour in 1/2 a cup of oil I'm using coconut oil but vegetable is fine\ntoo Also add a tablespoon of vinegar\nand 2 cups of boiling water Just gives those ingredients a quick to combine\nthem and then you're going to add in 2 tsp of instant\nespresso powder 1 tsp of salt, and 2 tsp of baking soda. Coffee has the tendency to intensify chocolate\nflavors and you can barely taste it so I highly recommend adding it in\nNow add in a heaping cup of good quality dark cocoa powder\nAnd 2 cups of all-purpose flour Now you can also do this recipe by mixing\nall the dry ingredients first then adding the wet ingredients\nbut really all you're looking for is to combine everything together\nand once you're satisfied with the cake batter you can divide it between two 8-inch pans\nwhich I have generously buttered, dusted with flour and lined with parchment paper to prevent\nfrom sticking You could also bake this cake in 9-inch pans\nor a bundt pan but keep in mind if you use the bundt pan it will take a lot longer to\nbake bake the cakes at 180 degrees celcius\nfor about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean\nLet the cakes cool completely and in the meantime you can start with the\nfrosting now I'm using the same recipe as I did for\nmy 'The Best Chocolate Cake' recipe but it's vegan\nI have here 1 cup of vegan butter that I'm melting in the microwave\nbut you can also use regular butter if you're not vegan\nTo the butter, add in 1 and 1/3 cup of cocoa powder\nand you'll notice that I've actually doubled the ingredient quantities from the old video\nand you'll soon see why I just need to use more icing for this particular\ncake Now throw in 1/2 tsp of salt\nand 2 tsp of vanilla extract Next add in 2/3 cup of non-dairy milk such\nas soy milk or almond milk if you're vegan and regular milk is fine if you're not\nand you want to alternate the milk with 6 cups of confectioner's sugar\nnow I know that seems like a lot of sugar but this does a lot of frosting\nand it is a special occasion cake so it's okay to indulge every now and then\nand just keep beating the icing, it's sometimes easier to use an electric mixer\nbut I do everything by hand and your end result should be a beautifully\nthick, velvety buttercream now you are ready to frost\nso once the cakes are cool you can run a knife around the edges to loosen them from the cake\npans and then flip them over\nif your cakes formed a small dome while baking you can also choose to use a serrated knife\nand slice the dome off but this is optional, it just makes for a\nsmoother top and those scraps make a lovely snack\nnow to assemble the cake just dab a blob of icing at the center of\nyour cake stand or plate it just helps the cake from shifting\nand then place the cake top-side down in the center\nadd a generous dollop of icing atop and then using a knife or an off-set spatula\njust spread it out as evenly as you can and place the second cake top-side up on top\nnow I like to do a crumb coat first so I'm just taking another generous blog of\nicing and spreading it out to cover the cake entirely\ndipping your knife in some hot water every now and then makes spreading out the icing\na whole lot smother now you can also half the icing recipe and\ncover the cake in one layer of icing but I wanted to pipe on some rosettes and\ntake decorating to another level which is why I doubled the recipe, so I could\nhave more now making rosettes is super easy\nyou just need a piping bag fitted with a 1M star nozzle\nand all you need to do is push in the center and make a nice swirl\nI wanted to cover the cake entirely in rosettes so I started with the sides and made my way\nto the center of the cake rosettes are super easy to make and they work\nwith any sort of buttercream or thick frosting I think they add a very impressive finish\nto any cake now this cake is a definite show-stopper\nand it's super easy to put together as you saw\nthe cake itself only requires a handful of ingredients that you most likely already have\non hand and what I love about it is that it's dietary\nfriendly, so a lot more people can enjoy it this cake is rich, chocolatey and definitely\nbetter than anything that you would find in a box\nand perhaps even in a bakery and it's bound to make any chocolate lover\nvery, very happy thank you guys so much for watching as always\nI really hope you enjoyed learning how to make this chocolate cake recipe\nNow I know that I post very sporadically and I apologize for that\nbut YouTube for me is one of my favorite hobbies and things that I Iike to do during my free\ntime so I'd like to keep it that way instead of\nit becoming a source of stress for me so I hope you understand\nif you liked this video don''t forget to give me a 'thumbs up'\nas always you can find the full printable recipe on my blog\nat hotchocolatehits.com

ravishing rocky road so which one are you in forever last okay sweeties that let's do sweet salty all-natural a touch of sea salt swirled in creamy milk chocolate there are two servings in here so it's not made to be eaten all at one time 210 calories for how well they came from California in a box so and I will try to save a piece of each one and get it in closer it plugs up because this camera doesn't do that so I will just show you at the end honey so this is sweet and salty sea salt it says a rousing nurse senses since 2002 I did get some salt in there these are made in San Diego California mm-hmm it's got quite a bit of salt in it mmm yeah that's good mm-hmm it is it is on the dark side that it is the once you get in your teeth you can kind of sounds gross but you know get your tongue in there and then you get that taste beginning doesn't it it's right it's really kind of you it's not something I would eat all the time just because it is dark chocolate about like so rocky right here what does it say it is on the front is they give a description yes salted caramel eyes almonds and chewy marshmallows pave the way in milk chocolate the experience fluffy marshmallows cozy after the crunch of caramel evolved into sea salt and silky milk chocolate one part plastic in two parts taxi ravishing rocky road is simply irresistible I think a picture of all of the pockets of innovating in the video it says oh yeah you just always leave Sarah says you're supposed to you see this my broad white oh wow we're gonna have to play listen this is coming out we need to see that it's in pieces but you guys gotta look at that that's about what yeah look we're definitely gonna have to get you guys in close on this one but it has huge pieces of home and big pieces of marshmallow I got a piece it has all three in it I can honestly say I've never seen that before yeah no big pieces of marshmallow oh whatever you're crazy where does that take a picture I think it was bad about eating it then there's not any further picture okay so it's so good Sara Sara yes that's Texas oh yeah these are the potato chip ones they're crisp Raquel cooked potato chips and a hint of sea socks and sea socks sea salt mix and mingle and nook chocolate has a special little thing on the back here oh yeah mumbles who I've just been writing but I think rainbow chard owes a sprinkle of sea salt and that irresistible potato chip crunch I don't see any chip in their litter when you buy them something ground-up awesome they'd only have that grief even temperature pay stuff that is freaking awesome it sure does we know that potato chip chips in the past and they sucked this is off that's really good and it's all to do with it I love that salty flavor I think that greasy potato chips is so that's my favorite these are the best three candy bars I've had in forever yeah that's my favorite when you're looking for that quality not that quick snack like American candy bars I'm talking like the quality sit down enjoy it all three of these are absolutely phenomenal coliform which would be your favorite I really like the first one that's sweet and salty one I like the potatoes this one too oh here's your do we have to honestly uh I like yours best you do thank you it's really good so if it's you know they're all close but you know for me these two are almost tied Dominions

and welcome back if you've been here before my video today it's going to be all about chocolate I'm gonna be telling you about my favorite chocolate brands and these are brands that I consider to be quite clean and healthy and just delicious I get these either between my local co-op Whole Foods or thrive market so I will kind of tell you availability for all of these and pricing as well also I am definitely more of a dark chocolate person so all of these are going to be more in like the dark chocolate realm I tend to like something between like seventy to eighty percent cacao okay first up is this brand equal exchange and I love this brand and it's delicious and they have so many different flavors and it's fair trade and it's just a really really cool brand so I get this on my local co-op and the pricing is 329 but they usually have promos on this for either like sometimes it's even down to two dollars so when it goes down to two bucks I totally stock up recently they just had a promo for 250 they do not sell this brand on thrive market but they do sell the coffee like you might see this little logo for coffee on thrive market I have not tried the coffee yet cuz coffee hurts my tummy and they do also have this brand at Whole Foods but it is slightly more expensive its 369 of bar at Whole Foods and then they recently had a promo for two bars for six dollars I get it at the co-op because it's cheaper but also because they have such a wide variety of these different flavors they have like probably 10 or 12 different flavors of the co-op whereas Whole Foods only has like four ingredients on this super super simple like this one for example there are only four ingredients in it and they're all Fairtrade so this is the Panama one this is my very favorite dark chocolate like dark rich chocolate bar in general if I have to choose I'm gonna go for this if I want something just plain and beautiful just one square of this after dinner boom done satisfied eighty percent cacao panama amazing love that one this one is their mint crunch this is 67 percent cacao so definitely sweeter again the ingredients super super simple see they're not all this added crap that's what I like and then finally I like their orange infused one so this is 65% cacao so getting sweeter um but orange is just so beautiful with chocolate again they're the ingredients now if you open up the bars you know on the inside of the packaging they tell you all about it which i think is so cool so it's like you know all about where it's from and who actually is involved in growing it like here we have this guy Louise Diaz I lost I got a picture of him and it talks about him and all this information so I just think it's really cool it's like a very responsible kind of brand plus their chocolate is freaking amazing that Panama one I'm like never without that any time I travel I always take at least one of those well alrighty next up I've talked about this brand many times in the last couple months it is hue by the brand hue kitchen hue as in human love this brand obsessed with this brand in particular this cashew butter 100 stinking good now these ones are available at Whole Foods I believe there are eight huge auklets bars available 8 different flavors I think Whole Foods has seven or eight of them also are available on thrive market but thrive only has six of the flavours these are not available at my local co-op yet but I did like do a little product recommendation for these bars that's actually the only product I've ever suggested to the coop so hopefully they'll have them soon thrive market there 549 and at Whole Foods they are $6.99 so definitely a price your chocolate bar but super super worth it just excellent excellent quality so I love to have a few of these simple ones the simple dark chocolate on hand just because it's a really beautiful just basic chocolate super good it is not quite as dark as this one this one I this is 80% this is probably more like 70% but super good we actually had friends over a few weeks ago and I was after dinner like I didn't prepare dessert or anything I just brought out a few chocolate bars and they had never heard of this brand and my friend's husband would taste of this he was just like oh my god oh my gosh that's amazing like that's so good super good now with hue kitchen I believe five of their eight flavors well actually I can't speak for one of them I think they have a banana one that I've never tried but they have some that are solid bars such as the simple one they also have a simple dark chocolate with salt they have one that is dark chocolate with vanilla and crispy quinoa and then they have one with mint crunch those ones are all solid bars then they've got these ones with butter okay so you've got thick cashew butter this one is my favorite like of everything cashew butter and pure vanilla bean dark chocolate and then they've got one with almond butter and quinoa and one with hazelnut butter now when you see the ones with the butters this is what they're gonna look like it's gonna have this little filling on the inside and it's so creamy and delicious and wonderful oh it's just such a perfect flavor now these should mean definitely are slightly sweeter like I know it says dark and it is dark I'm sure someone who loved milk chocolate would be like no that's absolutely dark but to me this is sort of like on the sweeter realm of dark chocolate that's so stinking good mmm oh and hello I should probably show you the ingredients so this is for the cashew butter one and then for the simple dark chocolate here we go alrighty my next brand is this one it's called eating evolved and they have this line of primal chocolate so they have a whole bunch of different bars these are just my two favorites and then they also have cups these little coconut butter cups which are super super good it's like a really decadent dark chocolate Cup and it has this coconut cream butter filling and they have different flavors I mean this one is just plain like the filling is plain but it's so good this one is mint inside YUM they also have a salted caramel I think they just came up with a strawberry cream I think they have a banana cream on but I have not tried that one yet either now regarding the bars these are ones that just came out and these are my favorite eating evolved bars they're cashew milk ones plain cashew milk cashew milk with almonds amazing they are so good when I tasted these like these are only the second bars of these I've got but then I immediately reordered because they're so stinking good just so creamy I think we're gonna be seeing a lot of chocolate that incorporates like cashew butter into them because it just blends this beautiful creaminess to it now I get all my eating evolved products off of thrive market because they have a very good variety and they also have a really good price so on three market for the bars they are each $4 nineteen cents the cups are to forty nine and then they also have this other product that I have not tried yet which are called keto cups so it's all about like high fat low carb ketogenic diet those are more expensive those are 1099 but again I can't take anything about the keto cups because I've never tried them but I have tried plenty of Hearts and plenty of cups now they do not have this brand and my co-op and I didn't see it at Whole Foods yeah some Whole Foods might have these but not at mine so I only get these at a throg market again super super clean ingredients very very basic not a ton of added crap all right and then for the cups these are the ingredients again super clean super basic so absolutely love eating evolved I order a lot of their chocolate from thread market like to always have that on hand and now that they have that cashew milk one so good they do have one um that's like a 70% bar with almonds that one's really really good too they also have a couple other bars that are really high in cacao percentages and they're just a little bit too too bitter for me I think they one called midnight that's like a hundred hundred percent I want to say and then another one that's maybe 80 and I just found them to be like slightly dry and chalky but then just a flavor it was just too much all right and I have one more brand I want to share and this is a chocolate brand I don't really buy as much and I do feel a little bit guilty getting it because there are like a lot more ingredients and I don't feel like they are as clean as these other chocolate brands um this brand Justin's they're dark chocolate peanut butter cups are so stinkin delicious I don't really do a lot of peanut butter products because it's a legume and like I know peanuts can cause inflammation and whatnot but oh my gosh like a healthier version of a Reese's Cup and dark chocolate so so so good I know they sell these at Whole Foods I know I've seen them there but when I checked last week they didn't have any available and they didn't even have a pricing so I couldn't gather that info for you they do have them at thrive a thrive market they have both the dark chocolate and the milk chocolate peanut butter cups and they are a dollar fifty nine and then at the co-op and they have the milk dark chocolate and white chocolate I've never tried the white have I tried the milk I don't remember and at the co-op they are a dollar ninety-nine and just regarding ingredients I mean here's the ingredient section there definitely are a lot more ingredients in these than the others so I try not to get these too often sometimes if you're having a really bad day and you want to just like self-medicate with chocolate this can be nice I mean any of these can be really nice but this one is kind of like my really guilty pleasure alright so there you go those are my favorite chocolate brands I do love them and I do feel very good about eating them I don't feel like I'm eating a ton of crap and preservatives and all this added chunk that's not fitted Justin's one there are a couple ingredients in there I'm not super thrilled with but they're really tasty um anyway I would love to know if you have any sort of healthy chocolate brands that you're super into that I didn't mention because I'm always on the hunt for a decent chocolate bar so anyway thank you

in there because they like it super hard it's gonna be quick simple and easy you can also at the end add some texture if you like that texture on your chocolate you can put some shaved nuts I used almonds and then you can also do some unsweetened shaped coconut shavings that goes really nicely as well some people just like their chocolate Plain Jane I know Lindsey does not like nuts or anything on her chocolate so I leave her as plain I made like a half-and-half this is just a quick and easy recipe that you can make on the fly if you want it to like steam your heavy cream or like heat it up and wait till it boils probably more like a ganache texture I just found that adding that heavy cream in there really gives it that silky consistency or at least for me I feel like almost that milk chocolate feeling in your mouth the chocolate came out amazing time for a taste test I've made this several times before so I know it's going to be delicious but camera taste this hmm I really love it

"Q7OJf1Idggo": "hey guys welcome back to another taste test me and I are gonna try these Cadbury Azir as a Dairy Milk because yes it is no dairy milk candy bars I've got the fruit and nut milk chocolate with raisins and almonds it is seven squares or seven blocks or 190 calories and the entire thing is 490 I have the roast almond milk chocolate with roasted almonds serving sizes seven blocks for 210 calories the entire bar is 540 searched one is rougher now we can try home line smell it okay hold up how big it is here's your bar the blocks are pretty small how many good he hit seven so you get two runs in one yeah that's that is your serving size for 210 calories yeah that right there I'm going to eat one square which is thirty calories so I'm about half that's that kind of chocolate it just flows and fills your entire mouth is if that melty thick book about like the almonds I'm not huge all my fan anyway but I don't like these islands cuz it has a flavor come apart flavor almost over but no coming now that chocolate is so strongly game page I can take some nuts in there taught me if you were to eat just a chocolate you deal with them I don't like it hasn't hurt okay alright this was the fruit and nut one and pretty much is the same thing till the back and kind of see some other stuff in there you can now make your spaceman off you just snap off girls stuff all day and and the NBA squared is where yeah good I want that I want to get a raisin in the box yeah it looks like there's a little everything in this one I feel I don't know and I really hired Flint can I taste your different how there's a huge difference huge this one has raisins in it you can taste the right nice decorations in mind goodnight rocket oh they were chewy here you go Mon try this one this alone I'm not yeah where you so problem all right that's the almond there's no moment in that how long road you like it otherwise no we should just all yeah just an almond okay I don't know like three almonds up yeah so you're gonna get your almond fix right there it was good it's very smooth no that's the work the magic work oh yeah this is the fruit did you get her a raisin I think there's some of their you know like raisins date I've changed a lot yeah she's like some older than she did you want to make you like the raisins the Marines yeah is when that said your little box lunch you made although you're getting every single thing that's in there I love these peaches roll it you go in there you eat as far as the texture goes no I can taste that right so I got it right there at the end a whole rise another much then I could taste it the texture is definitely different because the texture that raisin you know if you get a whole raisin you itch chewing it angers right though the chocolate is where you mainly tell it it's very very strong I don't think you would be dissatisfied that with either one of those I think I like that one better yeah I like the fruit did you say it was caramel no just no rest at all Oh rub Stallman come back that's it just yeah I think I like that one better yeah would you all I like the fruit that's not your person you like the nut would better boom so it's the brother they're both good I mean there's nothing wrong with either one of them but just whatever you like but lots of people have recommended the Cadbury brand to us and that's why we want it strong it is a very good smooth chocolate completely different than Hershey's it has a completely different taste to it and really you you can't compare oh so good", "pVmfAA3CVno": "today kevin and i have some chocolate to try for you this says new flavor kitkat nestle kitkat chocolate hazelnut spread and i have the milka max uh almond and corn and that one's not new we just we just didn't have roast but we haven't tried milk is really good too is awesome awesome awesome chocolate yeah and we've tried like the peanut and caramel we just haven't tried the almond so the kitkats both of these were from world market and in case you don't know world market has lots and lots of different kit kat flavors which we've tried most but you might have they have all kinds of flavors you may have never tried and then um milka they have all kinds of these milk bars too so it's a good chance to try milk if you haven't ever had one it's very very good yes it is well worth it so the milka bar was three dollars 15 cents that is worth every penny for this size bar i mean it's it's huge yeah this is like for a giant um and then this is a the kit kat it was 268 at world market so chocolate hazelnut spread you get nine nine packs of two um so each package is a hundred and four calories and these are uh manufactured by nestle in the uk so um they like their kitkats over there they do they get more stuff over in europe and select that than we do yeah they do uh but yeah they've got uh like we've reviewed the orange and the lemon and like mint and i know i've seen dark chocolate i've just seen all kinds of kitkats over there so so instead of i know some people order them from ebay and stuff and that's great for those like weird flavors that you can't get a hold of um but if you just want more general ones that but that are hard to find around here than world market they even have the japanese flowers sometimes oh yeah i got hazelnut that's good yes you do this has that typical kitkat wafer the crunch the chocolate's the same exactly uh the chocolate it's it's good quality it's not um not the richest chocolate that i've ever had but it's a very good quality chocolate seriously if you like kitkat anyway this is nice because it does have the addition of that hazelnut to it um but it's not too nutty no because we've had some that are overpowering yeah this is not like that this is just enough to let you know it's it's not quite as as sweet as the the spread the hazelnut spread right nutella yeah it's not quite that sweet right but it is but it is good now for the beast that's a huge game it is uh 100 alpine milk chocolate milka max uh almond caramel it is milka almond caramel um 10.5 ounces 300 grams there are nine servings so three dollars and fifteen cents for nine servings yes please that's actually quite a deal um it's 181 calories per 33.3 grams so i was going to try to see where this one came from www.mocha.com and most milka comes from germany this has portugal written on the back oh austria product of austria okay okay so now you open these like this and you pull so you have two sides and i'll just expose the whole thing so you can see how big it is and this is how every milka bar we've ever seen comes yeah they're all big like they're all yes they're they're huge uh but but you can break them into small pieces yes you can if you don't do a lot like i did and run it and smash it yes i literally like smashed it it's okay because it's soft in the middle i like the caramel and you get a little bit of almond crunch and a little almond flavor coming through too that's very good and the chocolate is excellent the chocolate you can't make it it's some of the best chocolate and you really taste that almond so sometimes you don't get the almond flavor that you really taste the almond it's just like in their peanut bar you taste the peanut i think the peanut bar is one of my favorites the big one like this but that um that caramel and i mean just the whole we tell you that it's smooth chocolate the milk but and we know how good it is but then we haven't had it in a while so when you taste it you remember yes that is the chocolate because it's probably one of our very favorites uh because it's so smooth and such good quality you said there were nine servings yes there's there's nine sets of four squares oh that's awesome so you get four whole squares for the serving so you cut it like this and that's your server no half of that [Laughter] four four squares four squares okay so half of this is your okay okay but that's only 180 calories for four of those no i don't think that's bad yes it's very very rich and delicious i would absolutely have no trouble getting that again and they do have the peanut there at world market if you're interested out of the two i'd rather milk them oh wow just cause it's a really rich creamy bar but the kitkat don't get me wrong it's really good it's just a it's more of a basic candy bar you know what would be fun if you were given i like themed baskets and gifts and stuff like that it would be cool if you went in world market and these are like 268 so not bad for nine it would be fun if you're having a birthday party or something or if you're just giving somebody a gift to open these and make uh like a little you could put two of each like each flavor like you could buy the orange you could buy the lemon the hazelnut the dirt and give somebody and you could do that among nine people or you could give them multiples of each one i just think that would be a really cool gift or stocking stuffers even at christmas uh easter's coming up before you know it it'll be here and uh that would be a fun easter basket and something different if you have a a bunch of different people that you buy for to buy one of these uh with nine bars and divvy them out and i just think that's a lot of fun so but definitely the milkas has the better chocolate so i hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music] so you", "GDWIkY2Yl8w": "hey everybody welcome to chef dog outdoor edition hey betty how's it going this is kelvin uh

with almonds I love that that is deleted I personally did not get anything so in month I gotta wait till after if it was really really good I love the blood brother back these are the milk chocolate toasted coconut 1/4 of a cup of the hunter heat huh and this work you muttering so but that was like good that would have me higher higher there's lots more much yeah these are little beady toga Hennessy salt oat clusters and another really strong hub that LIBOR loser very good but let me JT very very strong tough minute if you don't like toad man you're not going to this isn't gonna help

calorie base but it is a good - good ha I'm sure liya I like the coconut but I don't like the chocolate yeah and almond joys though and I'll enjoy it it's sweet mm-hmm that's nice wait it's so sweet the chocolates are very bitter very very very and that's composite me to hurt if there was the chocolate silver mm-hmm the next results maybe yeah that shocks me how hetero that is because yeah very very very venerable takes away from the coconut it sure does that would be nothing something I would get again I mean I don't absolutely hate it like hate it but it's just it's very very bitter no so I would know eat that one again but it was fun to try I'm glad we got to try it and here's I'm sure it was an expensive kitty book it says that these bags I saw price tag we're like $5.99 er yeah 595 of heat that is that's very very expensive for me so not cheap at all but my favourite out of the three is the heavens open up right with the folio I like those later on no I really do I like them a lot but these I think I don't know they just have been extra so so thank you Sarah very much for so just I'm going to have a picture of these at the end for you and thanks for watching [Music] you [Music]", "yVOvCZTM1O0": "hey there it's Steve and Jayden from serious Quito and today what are we gonna do we're gonna test out some perfect Quito nut butters yes we are now I gotta be completely transparent here I'm not really excited about doing this video because I like to make my own nut butter Kido products in general are pretty expensive nut butter in general is pretty expensive you take the two and you multiply it and it's pretty expensive so each one of these packets is ten dollars well that may seem like a lot of money I mean it is it's still about a dollar an ounce cheaper than some of the other Kido branded type sports nut butters that are out there so part of me is kind of hoping I don't like them so I can say don't get these make your own but I guess we're gonna find out okay do you have a flavor preference for starters we've got chocolate hazelnut which will probably be kind of like Nutella almond butter and jelly and snickerdoodle um let's start with the almond butter and jelly all right I forgot to grab our little spoons so for the almond butter and jelly it has suggested use drizzle over keto ice cream or on a keto bar for dessert pack it in your lunch or take it on a hike squeeze it right into your mouth whenever you need a delicious snack who needs bread in terms of macros on this the serving size is two tablespoons you've got 16 grams of total fat three grams of protein 11 grams of total carbs of that 5 grams or dietary fiber 3 grams our sugar alcohol so that gives us I think a net 3 grams of carbs depending on how you count sugar alcohol what I can scrape it off yeah so kind of comes out like toothpaste it like looks tubular and it stays in like a tube shape on the spoon yeah this is some pretty thick stuff and I really kind of squeeze to get it out I was kind of concerned that it might be really oily hmm that is that's good that is some good stuff like honestly like that's it really is kind of a winner tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or almond butter and jelly sandwich let's take a look at the ingredients see if there's any no no's in there we've got almonds coconut macadamia nuts erythritol blueberry powder strawberry powder raspberry powder apple powder MCT oil dragon fruit powder cinnamon sea salt lemon powder so none of know sort of like soy lecithin no artificial flavors no natural flavors this is just straight-up good stuff yeah and it tastes good too so I had some people when I was doing the bar reviews that said I just I hate the perfect keto bars but I love the nut butter and not other people that said I love the bars but don't really care for the nut butter so tastes can kind of differ from person to person but that almond butter it it honest to god tastes like almond butter and jelly on a sandwich yeah it like immediately one I'm not a very expressive person but like immediately when I put in my mouth I was like a total flavor pop so like one I would a hundred percent recommend it all right what do you wanna do next let's do this snicker do like or do it all cuz I feel like this will how I be leave like a lingering taste the chocolate well it could so let's do this so you want to read off the suggested use yeah so drizzle it over ice cream spread it on a keto bar blend it with your smoothies or eat the whole pouch we won't tell anyone mmm that's so that's an expensive habit if you're eating the whole part in one sitting and you're probably gonna exceed your macros I think yeah so do you want to read the 17 grams of fat 4 grams of protein 9 total grams of carbs of which 4 grams are dietary fiber 3 grams are sugar alcohol so that gives us a net depending on how you calculate sugar alcohol a net 2 grams of carbs in a 2 tablespoon serving kind of flattened out on the spoon right away this honestly it's good but it tastes like peanut butter to me it doesn't really taste like snickerdoodle no I would not if someone gave me this and said what does this taste like you I would say sort of generic nut butter yeah I'm just I'm waiting for even a snickerdoodle aftertaste yeah and I'm not getting the the cinnamon or yeah so I mean it's it's not bad it tastes good it's just not snicker I would know and I would I would have a hard time paying $10 for a pack of this yeah in terms of ingredients pretty straightforward on this it's just almonds coconut macadamia nuts erythritol MCT oil cashews cinnamon and sea salt so that one and then finally are you a nutella fan nah not particularly I'm a huge dark chocolate fan so Nutella is pretty sweet for me so knowing that I'll see what I think of this but yeah yeah it's too bad Kourtney's not here because Kourtney just loves Nutella and we'd have her you know give her take on it but just for comparison's sake I pulled up the nutritional information on Nutella what do you think is that well let's read the ingredients on this first we've got hazelnut coconut almonds cashews erythritol chocolate chips which are unsweetened chocolate erythritol cocoa butter stevia extract and sunflower lecithin so not soy lecithin cocoa powder macadamia nuts MCT oil cinnamon and sea salt so again pretty pretty clean what do you think is the number one ingredient in Nutella that is correct number two I guess hey water palm oil which also I think most folks consider not one of the better oils for you so sugar palm oil then hazelnuts skim milk cocoa soy lecithin and then vanillin which is an artificial flavor you're looking at 22 total grams of carbohydrates and two tablespoons of that 21 grams is sugar so not health food whereas this we've got 170 calories in two tablespoons total fat 16 grams protein 4 grams 10 total grams of carbohydrates of which for our dietary fiber 3 our sugar alcohol giving us a net 3 grams of carbs there's something sort of and maybe it's just because of you know changing a lot of diapers lately this the whole appearance of like squeezing this onto a spoon kind of freaks me out a little bit yeah it looks like there's like some crystals in there yeah they're not crystal it almost looks like a pudding based frosting in terms of the texture yeah but like yeah you see like the little yeah you see the little dots of that's probably my guess is hazelnut yeah I think it's good and I don't even really like Nutella so it's very natal is very sweet I think cuz of all the sugar but I think this gives like a nice it's probably my second favorite but it gives a nice like a little bit of chocolate nut kind of thing to it without being it like without being super in-your-face sweet yeah I think Nutella regular Nutella is like eating frosting mm-hmm it is to me it's just it's that sweet it almost leaves a coating on the inside of your mouth yeah this has a taste and the texture to me first the taste is a lot more dark chocolate which I like yeah and and you get you absolutely get the nuts it's not it's just nothing is overwhelmed by the sugar enos yeah but it tastes very much like a homemade in Nutella so I like this I think of the three of these probably this one might be the easiest to reverse engineer and make it home but not everyone has a commercial quality high powered blender food processor that can make nut butters so you know this product is really more for them I guess I think we're probably in the same place on ratings the almond butter and jelly this is a winner I I really like this and I think it might take an awful lot of work to see if I could reverse-engineer something like this I think this is probably a decent purchase when it's on sale chocolate hazelnut I think is a good product if you don't want to invest in a bunch of expensive equipment maybe also a good thing to get on sale yeah no complaints with it it's good probably good for travel or hiking or something like that you know when we just took our trip to Hawaii and got back well you just you can't get Kido food on a plane and if you're gonna be on a plane for nine and a half hours something like this could be a safe a lifesaver yeah because we want up buying this crappy hamburger that looked like it came off of a wheel of death vending machine and that was ten dollars and I'm sure nowhere near as healthy or satisfying as something like this so I think my criteria for buying these would be a they're on sale be there sort of a special occasion type of thing yeah the snickerdoodle hmm we can pass on that one I just like I said it was it was a tasty enough thing if someone said oh here here you go three dollars I would say oh well cool that's sounds great but it's not now typically I'm able to get my viewers a 15% discount on any perfect Kido products if you just use the link that's in the description below and the code serious Kido 15 at checkout but Justin from perfect Kido I told him I was gonna do this review and he said he would for five days there would be a deal where you could buy one product get the next one 40% off which actually then works out to probably 20% off so a little bit better than my 15% off you'd wind up looking at eight dollars essentially for a packet of this rather than ten dollars that deal is only going to be good for five days once that deal is over I will remove the link from the description so if you want to get in on that get in on that now if you enjoyed this video click the like

new to us at least I don't know how long they've been out Ghirardelli products we bought them both at Target I do not remember how much they were so I'm not gonna even guess let's see this is the milk chocolate sea salt cashew it's roasted and sprinkled with sea salt and Kevin has I've got dark chocolate cranberries infused with raspberry juice and a touch of freeze dried cherries so why don't we talk about yours far since yours has great and then we'll do much it says the perfect snack to satisfy your craving for real fruit and smooth chocolate it's got real dried cranberries dried in the cherries nuts and berries fret real dried cranberries covered in rich Ghirardelli toggle over to say cherries on that where's this I cherries Hut's are freeze dried cherries and essays cherries I don't know these are 25 pieces a hundred seventy calories or they're like seven calories each it's got a cool tab on the top and how many servings are in the back for a hundred of they has a resealable - I'm used to just taking things and put them in a bag but you know you shouldn't have to do that you know what we should have everyone saying um cuz on the back it shows a picture when I see that chalk on the outside and some darker on the inside it's good it kind of reminds me gonna clean them with chocolate there is of a dark chocolate chocolate covered cherry yeah it's not the same no I wish maybe after mine it was wrong for raisin although I wish it's a little tart to a normal school day of berries almost wish it was regular chocolate dark chocolate um yeah this is a dark chocolate cuz I got dark yo yeah I got dirt chocolate yeah I wish it was I wish they were just regular milk chocolate was been really really good that the chocolates kind of bitter and then that that tartness from the cranberries yeah they're okay it's not something that I would buy again definitely no they're not bad though I think they're good they're not bad it's just that torgus kind of reaches back and goes right okay you're gonna throw these oh yeah okay these are the milk chocolate sea salt cashew it says the perfect combination to satisfy both your salty and sweet cravings with crunchy nuts and smooth chocolate whole roasted cashews covered in rich Ghirardelli chocolate which I love cashews eleven pieces are 220 calories so they're very high in calorie cashews though are high calorie if you're a cashew it eater than you know cashews are high in calories then four servings in the bag they're about 20 calories each stop with our big she don't know oh they smell so good these would be dangerous I'm sure to me because you're just gonna pop these in your mouth and they're not Frenchie jackass you yeah it's a cashew is a soft it's a softer nut taste the salt in there definitely the chocolate is not really strong though is it you can definitely tell there was chocolate there that's really good oh yeah those are very dangerous oh yeah I gotta stop those are good yeah I give these are five yeah those get a 5 a 5 out of 5 and these get maybe a three get the right yeah cuz they're they're edible you could eat them you can sit around snack on but I think that tartness will get to you after a lot yeah definitely you you get you get all three components when you eat one of these you don't get the chocolate the cashew and the salt the salt really comes through a lot of these things that say sea salt good don't get the sea salt this I mean I just got another like piece of salt in much if you literally hit the salt you know so if you crave something like that then this is this is the thing this would satisfy your craving No very good they were if I had to guess they were probably a little pricey but I'm not sure that some check on my own we found these at Target so they're really good", "OR05hmM8P5A": "life City family what is up it is art and Bobby back at the grocery store for a video all about chocolate yes all about chocolate from cocoa powder chocolate chips chocolate snacks chocolate bars chocolate nut butters all that good stuff I want to guide you to find the best quality chocolate at the grocery store so you know exactly what goes into your body before we get into the chocolate and goodness you know the drill like subscribe share but more importantly there's a bell icon right below the video you're gonna want to enable all notifications because the month of January we pretty much have videos going live every single day and you want to get a push notification cuz we're having a great time alright let's start with something kind of basic here here's chocolate chips and cocoa powder do you guys know the difference between cocoa oay and cacao a oh I don't know if people really notice this but this is the traditional cocoa here and it's Oh a and that's cacao AO this stuff is the stuff I use and this is raw unprocessed cocoa this is processed cocoa that's been through some treatment so it's really interesting right and this also this cocoa here has been alkalized right it has some alkalinity to it to lower the acid to it this is completely raw the cool thing about chocolate in general is that it's a fermenting process have you ever seen a rock to cow pod this is big crazy football looking thing but they dry out the beans and they actually ferment them then they turn it into chocolate but I prefer to use the raw cacao because I want that raw benefit without it going through processing but I just want you to see the difference between the one where spelled a o and O a you can get this stuff anywhere sometimes Costco has a monster bag of this brand knobby toss raw cacao it's the best deal ever and I believe it's only a seasonal item and this is actually cacao nibs so when you actually take the cocoa bean and pulverize it this is what you get then you grind these into a chocolate liqueur which is like almost like a liquidy paste then you would add sugar or milk to it but these are really good to make with or just have a snack they're very bitter but very delicious so knowing that will come down to chocolate chips right here it's a really exciting time to buy chocolate chips because the world is sugar free chocolate chips in my pen is next level and when we pick up a normal chocolate chip like this there's nothing wrong with it right these are dark chocolate chips the problem is they're always made with cane sugar and that's the kind of sugar we try to avoid we know cane sugar is not good for us but it also is really bad if you're in gut bacteria we talked about this in the sweetener video cane sugar is the worst sweetener of all if this was sweetened with maple syrup even McGough a nectar would be better something else besides cane sugar I'd be ok with it but I wouldn't be as good as I can be because come down here these sugar free chocolate chips from Lily's our next level delicious you guys so we look at the ingredients and you see they're sweetening it with non-gmo erythritol they use real vanilla and they use stevia extract and the cool thing about this is that it tastes just like the real deal the only one I would maybe avoid is the milk chocolate one because something I find in many other sugar-free chocolate chips they add natural flavors but men if you follow me on the Flav's to the instagram I've been using the dark chocolate sugar free trips to make my keto pancakes on the weekend they're so good you your boo your kids they won't know the difference and it's so much better for you if you're not following me on the flavor City Instagram head over there daily post but daily stories I would make from dinner and it's really really fun so that's super duper exciting to me so I would look for those chocolate chips they're a little more expensive they're $6.99 but without having the sugar that's really important to me now it's winter time we have hot Coco's here the thing with all hot cocoa is just like with the chips they're gonna have sugar so we look at this this is a premium brand here I just knows premium because I'm paying for the glass right but I look at the ingredients first ingredient is cane sugar and they're also sneaking in some natural flavor here so that kind of bugs me but its standard process right you're always gonna see every kind of a hot chocolate like that so I'm actually working on a recipe I'm not done yet for a sugar-free keto hot chocolate that is dairy free and it's unsweetened raw cacao organic coconut sugar a monk fruit sweetener and some cinnamon I'm almost there follow me on Instagram when I'm done I'll post it it's fantastic so these are like the chocolate 101 basics you really want to know let's go down here real quick because I'm gonna go to a part of the video I think you're gonna get really excited about chocolate bars and chocolate snacks let's start here these to me are super exciting because there's schools safe there's Sun buttercups they got rid of peanut butter but sunflower seed and in case your kid or your school has a no nut policy these are really cool the thing is right we look at the ingredients here and we see it's made with dark chocolate so I'm really excited it's not milk chocolate which I consider candy they do use some powdered sugar which I'm kind of bummed out about but how much of the sugar is 12 grams for two servings so to 6 grams per that's just over a teaspoon not terrible the thing is you're very limited when it comes to like nut free treats so this isn't that bad but what excites me even more is sugar free chocolates are taking over the grocery store starting with this you guys these are unbelievable these are from evolved there are butter cups these are the ones that have pretty clean ingredients look at this instead of cane sugar all of a sudden we have coconut sugar Himalayan pink salt not a refined bleached salt but this is cool but if your Kido look at these these are called keto cups and this flavour right here via I'm the first one to break into this how exciting this hazelnut butter art and I had this the other day art how good was this so good look at the ingredients like this did not exist just a couple years ago the drill some artichoke is for fiber cacao butter monk fruit sweetener MCTS this stuff is amazing so you can get them at the store you can get them online very exciting they also make them in these packages which is fantastic also on a reach-in to my cart this is not in stores this is online only but I've been doing some Instagram promotion with this company this is nirvana they're the only company that makes keto sugar-free chocolate truffles each truffle has one net carb here and it's sweetened with a low lows and erythritol and stevia next level ingredients and there's nootropics in there too I'll put a link down below this stuff is fantastic the peanut butter truffles are next level that's online only and then Lily's also has sugar-free dark chocolate just be careful because sometimes when you get to the flavored varieties here like this is salted caramel milk chocolate they sneak in natural flavors and the sure enough there it is right there so you got to be careful and then don't be fooled by brand images on the front cover a lot of people like to think this is a premium company because they make the premium peanut butter the thing is just like their peanut butter they use palm oil so let's see where the ingredients are here the peanut butter they have cane sugar here and let's see right there thank you art palm oil so they use palm oil with their peanut butter so I wouldn't get that I would just get the either the coconut sugar and the keto cups and then there's a documentary on Netflix called a rotten never whole episode about chocolate most of the chocolate from the world comes from Africa or South America but to countries in Africa I think it was Ivory Coast and whatever is right next to it they use a lot of slave labor in the chocolate industry and these guys are slave labor free chocolate just watch the documentary it's crazy but when you buy chocolate you really want to my dark chocolate because I consider milk chocolate to be pretty much candy alright that's it for here let's wrap up the video with chocolate flavored peanut butter spreader like Nutella and chocolate cookies all right for all of my Nutella fans out there the bad news is Nutella is not something I would eat it's made with palm oil and tons of refined sugar and there's really no chocolate nut spreads on the market except the one that is Bobby approved we come down here and this company is next level it's nuts oh and they make a chocolate powerful fuel first of all look at the nuts they're using here in the seeds to chia flaxseed hazelnut and what I love about it if we look at the chocolate see they're using coconut sugar and then the rest of the ingredients are clean and they're using Celtic sea salt one of my favorite unrefined salts this is as close as you can get to hazelnut spread or Nutella there's another one here that looks fancy right it's called no cheer laughs yeah and you're like oh it's organic I'm gonna get it guys Organic doesn't necessarily mean anything look at the ingredients first ingredients cane sugar then we have sunflower oil while sunflower oil is better than palm oil it's still highly processed and highly refined not something I would want I would look for that uh nuts oh I wish they had the big version at Costco like they do for the power fuel that'd be amazing and then all right let's switch around here the wall of chocolate chip cookies is almost impossible because either they use bad oil too many refined sugars there's really only one I can see here and it's this brand so this brand is very high-quality it's from out of Chicago these are chocolate chip cookies and what I love about it is that it's made with a nut and seed blend and they're using coconut sugar so it's paleo and coconut oil so look at the rest of the ingredients all fantastic and the thing is here's my problem you have to read the label cause the double chocolate crunch cookie instead of using coconut oil they're now using palm shortening asterisks responsibly sustainably sourced don't be fooled by that you guys organic palm sugar is like having organic canola oil it's still highly processed in however you're fine so it's honestly one of the only cookie ii find here is this chocolate one that uses good quality ingredients no wheat no grains and a good fat and a good sugar so that's it you guys I make a video about chocolate because there's a lot of options but eating healthy doesn't mean eliminating chocolate it's about eating the right chocolate and the options now our next level this stuff did not exist sometimes five years ago or back in my childhood forget about it it was Hershey's bars and that's it all right what video to make next leave a comment down below these videos are all about you guys like subscribe share the only way our channel keeps growing the way it has is all because of you we got two more of those videos going below us right now but art and I will see you very soon until then we say to you like we always do hashtag keep on cooking mad love and peace guys"}
