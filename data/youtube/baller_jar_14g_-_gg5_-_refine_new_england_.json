holiday but it was worth it um i decided to treat myself at discount and rewards points so no i did not pay full price for this before you even get into that i just i didn't pay full price for it i've been saving up rewards points and stuff so i did get one of the moxie baller jars i think that's a stupid name but i just wanted to get one i don't get moxie very often because of the price the good quality is usually good but that's just the price i i do buy their sand though i'm not gonna lie this is number 74 of 420 uh better pictures on my instagram i have not opened it yet i figured i'd save it for you guys on the youtube channel so i'm doing this before bed a little dab for me not going to get crazy i just want to enjoy a little bit so it's my 7 10 dab i'm excited um uh i'm not gonna get

said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i

prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104

with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get

harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at

seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one

pittsburgh it's ridiculous right now uh we're supposed to be getting some worse weather coming up i think tomorrow i think we got another storm front coming in tomorrow so if you haven't gotten to the dispensary yet oh my god look how look at the nice the size of these buds look at this this is not the popcorn we've been used to seeing from a lot of dispensaries lately uh now granted they sometimes sell it cheaper but you know what nothing presses as well as these nice juicy buds they've been rehydrated with hydra stones for two hours so they are ready to go um the smell of this stuff is absolutely intoxicated just by itself uh gg4 is a strain everybody seems to know and love i don't know too many people that have told me hey man i really hate gg4 so this is gonna be fun to press oh okay let's get this nice and put in here make sure you can kind of see what's going on all right we're going to cut the excess off the bag grab some parchment [Music] oh yeah super it might be it might be i did find out with this newer press that you really have to [Music] uh have to put a lot of layers in here because this stuff will seep through at the kind of tonnage you're putting on it now it's got to make kind of a directional pouch here to make sure everything stays inside where you want it to be all right get this in here fold up our bag and put it in the middle of our little pouch right here that summer's right there thing is it isn't going to look real pretty on video because when these plates really close down we're going to lose everything on the video but wait do you see what it looks like when it comes apart again it should be super cool i'm going to move the camera a little bit i'll stay stay where you are give you guys a real good view of what's going on here has some happy trees here in a minute all right bring it right up here [Music] turning green to gold that's what we do here at astr's finest closed not available okay here we go and we're bringing the hammer down see what this stuff does so might be able to get us a little better view here here we go [Music] let's get this camera adjusted here for you a little tighter [Music] there we go [Music] i like that heat soaked in there as i bring up that pressure gently i'm looking for that seepage to start really quick because this is a really nice strain a lot of people are pressed gg4 pressing this at last time i pressed gg4 i pressed it at 200. let's see what it does this time i think it's gonna be [Music] beautiful oh yeah out of love gotta love that smell okay okay relax everything [Music] i like using the phone as a monitor because i can get it real closely until i hit a certain point this is right around the point where you're gonna stop seeing a lot of stuff on the video watch this [Music] just keep bringing the pressure nice and slow and nothing will start to move oh god yeah let's see anything [Music] so [Music] so here that is the sweet spot this might not be the most exciting part of this video but you're really going to love what you see coming off of this thing in a minute i can guarantee you that sure all right big shout out to my friends over at rise of monroeville my family up there hope you guys see this video this is the fire that was purchased at your dispensary today check it out we're gonna open this up here in about 30 more seconds and we're going to see what she's doing oh come on show me what i want to see show me that gold [Music] show [Music] okay oh [Music] what happened all right i'm gonna pull this camera out like ouch back over here all right like opening up a present on christmas day look at that isn't that beautiful [Music] oh look at that looks beautiful yeah it's a happy plant there was no overpressure no blowout came out perfect nice and different so if you want to see it okay do this in two stages i'm gonna grab a slick and deposit it all on here so i can squish it out and show everybody how pretty it is and then we'll put it into a jar we'll weigh it up for you to see what the yield is good nice brand new slick [Music] and make sure there's no cap air which is a hazard in this place all right skip tool my brand of choice when it comes to this type of thing i really like the way they work okay here we go oh look at that look at that consistency so glad i did this at 180. at 200 i think this is shattered up i really do oh [Music] beautiful day this fills the room that beautiful stuff yes sir high quality thc tell me you seen the water boy oh yeah [Music] [Music] just [Music] dude colors color is awesome color is completely what you want to be seeing that beautiful pastel [Music] well you're dealing with a variable plant you know it's different every every batch is a little different every pheno is definitely different you know so you can automate things to a certain degree but it still really takes somebody who knows what they're doing watching what's going on you know if i dress that stuff on there another minute and a half it would have probably shattered up you know that's what i mean it's just a matter of doing it doing it doing it until you kind of do it by instinct on this you know i i don't really like using gauges and stuff like that but uh do you find that maybe indicators produce a little more than sativa they do they do they do yeah as a general rule now the exception to that rule african tie i knew it and and malawi memory loss also for the crime those those are two straight indica or straight sativas that produce and behave like indicas on a press i've never seen anything else like um banana kush from from rhythm is another one that's really really nice and oppressed brownie scalp birthday cake great divide all of those excellent yeah you should check out my database i got a link to it that you know you can it changes as i add new data like when i add this it'll update right now so everybody who has a link can view it you can't change anything on it you can look at it it's only like my fifth dispensary flower press this year well the thing is dude you bring what you need for you you know this is about you i mean i love making it for you but this is about what strain works for you right i think i'm a little snobbish when it comes to me only because this is what i do all the time i don't try to press a lot of stuff under 25 percent for me but for patients hey that's your medicine man i'm going to try to get you the very best of what it will give but when you get below you know 25 the yields start to drop significantly so but this this is really really nice just came up very very nice and here missina is not happy to be excluded from the festivities she is a she wants that hey she wants what she wants when she wants it and that's just how it is with the caliper no she does she's she likes she likes to smelly sticks her nose in my raws and every time every time she gets the chance she gets man oh absolutely well here's the other thing too okay you know look i know you're not supposed to smoke it but most people who who who do flower they they smoke right so you take an eighth home that you just spent 65 bucks on or 60 and you're gonna get if you're lucky three joints or maybe two once out of that eighth okay that to me is half a day's worth of medication at most at most you take that same eight you press it the rosin press and get anywhere near a grammar rosin from it and grandma rosin medicates me to the same level three solid days that's why i do this because you save money and get better medicine because this is nug run not trim this is solventless in its purest form right off right off the plant right into rosin no intermediate work needs to be done single stage to medicine so let's get this kind of gathered up okay i'm gonna try to get this all together there we go now it's gripping oh it's broken now there this is mighty fine medicine okay what i'm gonna do is backlight it so you can really see how nice this really is look at that look how clean that is that is beautiful gg4 gti let's find out what our yield is now shall we because that's what a lot of people are waiting to see what did we get so started off 10.5 let's see what 10.5 turned into okay zeroed out get her in the jar oh 1.573 i'll take it any day thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other asher's finest on the case", "A_kxN5PQQls": "don't you hate it when you can't scrape all the hash out of your little stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "7BzRUMCd_bQ": "[Music] what's up what's going on kiddos welcome to the beach um we're gonna make this kind of quick because it's raining out here it's

this dabbing world and [ __ ] so like i said i'm honestly giving this royal cookie bro right here like a [ __ ] i'll show you guys that again bro it smells stupid derpy i'm honestly giving this thing like a [ __ ] 9.5 the 0.5 just because i mean it doesn't have like a nice ass baller jar you feel me but it's for sure up there bro it's fire um a lot of people probably see these around when you guys are copying like baller jars or whatever these 3.5 and these are nice bro you feel me they got a nice-sized design on them and [ __ ] so somebody will pay like hella extra just to get a cool ass jar so i feel like if they throw this in a clean ass jar or at least throw the sticker or some [ __ ] on here make it look a little clean then i feel like you'll get a straight 10 for me but it's a 9.5 on the product it's gas if you guys got this imperial anywhere near you guys make sure you guys grab it and like i said if you guys want to see a review on this car bro let me know in the comments down

his dirty ass i'll just show you guys what i am embarrassed to like actually put this on but uh he said he wants to get a bong so i'm gonna take him to get a bung but the point of this video is this dollar dab i bought this a week ago still haven't done a video on it and uh hopefully i could split this in two depending on the size so i want to give him one as well but in my opinion to get the full effect you should do the whole thing that's what i was thinking yeah we'll see we'll see because it kind of it feels like it has some weight so we'll see we'll see we got rj we got rj subscribe to him if you haven't already he just got done doing a video yesterday with his cousin so it should be a good one whenever he does decide to pick it up he brought the forbidden fruit as well you know you've probably seen the video where we uh went and picked it up already fire stuff but yeah whatever i just gotta say man i hope you guys are enjoying your week um i have not been releasing as many videos as you guys do see uh but man there's a lot of reasons i don't want to digress into that right now but i hope you guys are patient with me and i am 25 so plenty of time yep so let's do it baby all right boys we are back showing what you got you know i'm saying a little a little uh what is it detachable one oh damn that noise oh dangerous let me put up here yeah you could switch it so you can go here oh it's in there oh whoa okay so it's a switchable beaker bung so you could hit it like a normal beaker bong or you could switch it off put that here put that there i think i like it this way it's like a science project right here so it's like you know homie's got to put some water in that yeah we got a new ball yep let's go baby yeah and also uh the homie picked up another one of these from that video uh the night the dispensary run the jetties yes the jetties uh legend legendary sky og sky og take a hit of this so yeah man i was about to get this rick and morty mom i'm not even a fan of rick and morty but i just saw the design on it it was for 35 bucks luckily i had the second greatest person here with me you know i'm saying no i'm just joking now but luckily andrew was there and he pointed out some other bombs you know for better price and not even that better design like on the bong itself so like i said this is only one dab so if it's not enough for me and randy to take we're gonna be taking other dabs alongside you know this video as well or in this video but the whole point of this video is to showcase this one dollar dab that i got from finos exactly a dollar out the door so oh nice let's see the functionality i'm gonna need more water so definitely gonna have a good time getting hot tonight as i play video games right here hold this all right how do you let me do this i'm uh i'm gonna showcase it hold up open it all right go so the strain is sour sandia uh the brand is bloom or something what is that boom or is it say here right there it's on the text bloom oil here boom something whatever i think it's the papers got it all messed up it's cool yeah i don't really care bloomfy bloomfire something bloomfire boom fire bloomfire something okay let's loom field you think yeah you're right okay yeah all right open it let's see what this looks like i'm excited to see what this looks like guys [ __ ] little dollar dad okay so i had this plastic i don't even know just twist that [ __ ] up feels like a fat rocks in there push down and turn oh there you go put pour on your hand the [ __ ] is that so we got one dollar dab you guys [Laughter] that's literally a one dollar debt okay this is for people who uh don't smoke as much i assume put the thing in there so i could prefer a thumbnail do you want to get better lighting what do you think this [ __ ] sun's [ __ ] is good here we go the [ __ ] is this there you go baby dab one dollar there so we had a one dollar dab as it looks like it looks it looks like it's for you know people who don't smoke as much and you're looking to you're in no how about this oh i think this is for more it's glass huh is this glass i think you just toss the whole thing in there yeah really i think so i'm just joking i don't know you don't burn all that that's [ __ ] plastic honey it's plastic that little rubber thing no not that or is there a read me i wonder if it's fire it's batter so you think you just put it in there you just i don't think you put all this in there no no not that green obviously i don't think i don't even think you put that glass piece into either think about it sure i don't know is there another youtube video no [ __ ] it won't we won't you want to light this for me yeah here i'm gonna put this back on so yeah it's not over i know i know so uh randy's gonna heat that up for me i'm gonna take this hit but yeah it pretty much looks like just one hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn that uh let's pack you a hit of do i have my stuff on i'm not using this no you haven't tried this yet we're gonna give him this is the sherbert so i have a diamond i think that crack diamond oh did you say that diamonds aren't as tasty yeah man let us know if you guys tried that dollar dab or if you've heard of a dollar dab or anything like that similar or you know let us know in the comment section below yeah seriously though seriously though it looks like a phone experience for the dance for him that's a [ __ ] that's a dollar dad right there it's a [ __ ] fat one dude i want a light but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't know why we didn't think about this [ __ ] wow damn it you have to be high first here give me that i don't know if i should do that yeah okay it's going in it's ready yeah cheers you guys hope you guys are enjoying the videos you watch continue to support my homie and yeah go up here more show them that droppage oh yeah oh yeah rainbow sherbet yeah it's smooth yeah yeah diamonds are not as harsh but yeah yeah good good call on this let me try that for ben frizzles [ __ ] yeah i wish i had thought about that earlier i'm stupid that's cool all right even though we didn't do i didn't do it i did tell you that the taste was there it was good it was good so excited we couldn't cap it for you guys though [ __ ] anyways damn you barely touched this yeah i know can you light it i told you i've been smoking the other one oh yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that video you guys would have already seen by now maybe yeah if you guys see the basements that i bought that trash i'm trying to burn all of it all through it you know i'm trying to best for life trying to save the bet yeah the best for last you know best believe i wasn't gonna bring that out to the homie andrew that's [ __ ] disrespect bring that [ __ ] around scent you know what i'm saying so i was like nah i ain't gonna do it anyways so i only brought the [ __ ] the cart and my uh forbidden fruit and we have a good time for you guys man all right oh yeah try this car it's kind of clogged so it's all right uh in the video guys i said it was 100 uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "t3guzHArEDo": "this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience then watch this video today we have a four gram jar of some double black concentrates VBS carat diamonds they're VBS carat diamonds are some of the larger largest a big diamonds I've ever seen so we're gonna see what we've got here I got a four gram jar of the lemon bezel and it's about seventy five percent total THC and I can't wait to crack into this let's see if we got some good stuff [Music] [Applause] and this lemon diesel smells so good and there's one diamond in there it's like so much bigger than the rest it's like [Music] yeah let's let's get into this all right so the VVS diamonds look really good let's have a coke sesh with them right now [Music] well I'm a big tester all of us that's gonna get smells gonna happen but if you liked this video make sure you subscribe to the channel for more content in the future and for a lot content tune in to my twitch in and twitch.tv slash Cubans they have live right now", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like

porn on Instagram I'm popcorn TV on Twitter but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ] video on live browsing and don't forget to subscribe i

this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "_E4-qQ48Nis": "just pay alive hit means coffee shop Oh awesome I work here it's uplifting

pretty funny this I never seen him that stoned and we smoked for a couple years so what's that one on there [ __ ] Gold these guys fine I started to cool down from that last dad man all right here we go time to get hot again whoo these dads make it hot um should I use this Clark Kent I think i'ma go with the directional guys all the right here she got to look at it but he didn't go with the

like that here we go laughs Cheers you know caught them up with a [ __ ] cheers guys I wonder what I'm dealing with throwing over my phone there's a Dave & Buster's ashtray behind it aren't you guys I'm gonna get out here drink some water maybe do a DAB after I recover but I'm out of here see you guys next time please", "1XJp5ylJsG8": "but you can see what it left here in the ground check this i oh my gosh it is a freaking hey what's up guys welcome back to another video in today's video dad and i are going to be going to a couple old home sites where we find some cool relics in the dirt be sure to stay till the end of the video guys because dad finds this humongous silver coin which he ends up returning to the owner that's kind of like a thank you so we didn't get any close-ups of it but the coin itself is awesome so if you guys do enjoy this video please be sure to like and subscribe because it does help our channel grow and it's free we'll catch you guys in the hunt enjoy all right this is this old house we're hunting today like i said very tradition around it but still pretty cool place check this chimney out i just love that chimney just rocked together i don't even see mortar joints in it or anything that is so cool we're guessing this house was late late 1800s early 1900s but that chimney work is unbelievable wish i had their craftsmanship they had back in them days just to lay these rocks out the way they did pretty awesome all right guys check this out i've moved this out of the hole i was like that's got to be a route and i kept looking and kept looking well come back to it oh look at it i don't know what it is it come up like a coin not broke but anyways i think it's a piece of uh looks like a piece of a clock watch um pocket watch but it was embedded into that root so hard to tell how how long it was in the ground to be embedded inside that root guys wow i just found a us button this please tell me that's what that is no way that's civil war let's go baby i would think wow oh my gosh that's a nice neighbor now oh really oh that's nice wow guys we are in such a trashy area and i just dug this us button right out of it it's so heavy dad i i said the other day i wanted to find one of these actually i wanted to find like a belt buckle but this button is awesome man let's go man i wish you guys could have caught my reaction so right here is where i dug it it was probably about um i'd say six inches down in the ground and it came up screaming if you guys want to know the signal on it i'll put it back down on the ground and let you let you hear the signal well i guess let you look at the signal i got my headphones in so i'll put it right there and check out what it's reading guys that's a solid 32-34 wow that is awesome guys i'll go over my settings in uh in a little bit great find i was super bummed out guys we put this on our facebook page aqualand relics and somebody actually pointed us in the right direction of what it was turns out it wasn't like a button i believe it was like a rosette or something either way it wasn't civil war but it was world war ii error still a cool find in my book but i still am searching for that us buckle hey guys for my settings i was running field two i had my recovery speed on two i had my f2 on two and my fe on zero i also did my noise cancel and ground balance i'm using 50 tones and my sensitivity is on 21. all right guys we're starting to burn daylight david and jordan's down there that's where jordan found out a horse rose at so they're over there tearing it up down there but anyways i've done three wins wheat since here i didn't put them on video but here looks like possible silver but it's coming up as a nickel tone so this is gonna be silver i'm thinking it's probably gonna be like a war nickel because the war nickels had so much silver in them and that's what it's going to be but i can tell you right now it's definitely silver and the easiest way to tell if it's a war nickel if you have requesting yourself right above the i think that's called the monticello but it will have a large letter you know for where it was minted at this one here happens to be a p so it was philadelphia so it is silver i think it's like somebody can correct me if i'm wrong 35 silver something like that let's go over the at pro settings here i've had a couple people ask me how i run my at pro when i'm out hunting for anything like coins or civil war or anything like that i always have mine set up in pro zero mode i love to hear that high tune that an item gives to you when you uh use the pro zero when you go to the the custom mode then you get that ding dong sound like a doorbell and i just don't like that but anyways i can run it here today i'm running a full blast i got it sensitivities all the way up to the max and i'm running 25 iron to screw i'm just trying to get rid of some of the nails and stuff like that but that's how i run my at pro when i can i i love running full sensitivity if possible but we're burning daylight here let me see if i can find another coin here before it's all said and done all right let's try a live dig here you can hear that how that detector's screaming that's what i was telling you i like pro zero mode it's ringing up about at 81.82 and it says about six inches deep and that's where i've been digging almost all my coins at today like i said i've gotten four coins so far turned out to be a decent day especially with jordan digging that rosette that was a pretty cool i've never even dug one of them so he's ahead of me on rosettes but let's see what we can find with what's in this hole oh okay that's a decent little fine uh this is probably what they call an organ read you know the instrument if you clean them up you can actually see the note that that was for for that that read usually down here on this end somewhere down on one of these ends right here should have a note that's what that is that's an organ read or some kind of a reed i found a lot of these in old home sites and we're burning daylight really quick here i just wanted to show you this fine it seems like a pretty cool find i think it's actually some kind of knife blade just by how pointy it is i don't think it would be an axe or anything that small i think it was some kind of knife at one point in time it had a pretty nice edge on it don't know just thought was pretty cool it'll find here guys what do you guys think this is right here i seriously don't have any idea at first i thought it was a shotgun casing but with the edges around it i don't think it's that pretty cool though hey guys so i bought my recovery speed up to three only reason being is because it's so trashy in here and this is why i did it i had a big old trash lid right there but i also had this wheat cent right by it both showing that it was the same tone however one was deeper than the other the trash can lid was on top and the penny was about six inches down in the ground so that's why i dug it and that's why i put my recovery speed on the three this is one of the spots i've been wanting to detect for a while i've seen it for years always slobbered over it was one of our local icons that owned the place but anyways i'm struggling today already uh you can hear a lot of we got an interstate right over here and we got a main avenue right here so we got a lot of outside traffic i got my earphones on today which i don't normally use i don't know if anybody else experienced this with the simplex but i think this is to me is a big weakness of the simplex and when you use headsets it actually changes the tone sound and i'm so used to hearing the certain tunes and then you go to a tune that's completely different it's tough so we're going to see jordan said he guaranteed fine silver today let's see what happens see if he can find silver or not but we'll see all right i got my first decent dig of the day oh it's coming up by the 70 71 on the simplex and i hope this background noise ain't too much i got a some kind of a heater behind me but anyways first coin of the day and let's see what it is see if we can see it together here well it's got abe's bust on the front let's get over here in the sun it's got abe's bust on the front i think it's gonna be another wheat cent yes it's gonna be a wheat cent so that's a good first dig of the day i'll take that wheat cent if it's a good date i'll let you see a close-up i was on the other side of the house and wasn't doing the greatest i come over on this side because i'm thinking this was the sunny side of the house and people would be more out on this side during you know just because it's the sunny side i got an 86 87 on the at pro that i'm using right now and i think it might be something good let's look at it together i just went over and got jordan i said you got to come see this look right here oh it might have fell out now that that's it right there i don't know what this is going to be oh it did fall out it's down here lying but you can see what it left here in the ground check this i oh my gosh it is a freaking half nice i see in god we see it down here let me get the juice out oh my this could be my best silver ever you already found a half though yeah but not this might be an older one yet let's check this out oh that's a ben franklin awesome it's silver though 1956. that's my first ben franklin right there half a dollar all right i'm back again i just wanted to see if you guys maybe somebody out there could verify this for me i find these a lot i don't know five or six per year someone was telling me they was for the end of sausages that clamp down like to keep your bags shut does anybody have any idea i mean they come up screaming on the metal detectors uh if you do know give us a comment down there and let us know what you think about it got an old coin here i don't know what it is maybe we can check it out together i see some really nice green tint to it but it almost looks like a dime if it's a dime it ain't going to be probably that old no i think it's bigger than a dime yeah it's just a memorial a green memorial oh well maybe next hole guys check out this this is actually my first marbur marble ever found check this out i've heard about people digging these all the time but i've never found one they don't come up on the detector but they're still really cool i was about seven inches down [Music] you", "bGQsYtGpE4o": "hi will you be trying to find this product we have responses to suit your needs

reality what's inside the little cartridge that you get as there's concentrated you can buy them you know i think in half grams grams at dispensaries and things like that is a concentrate yep i mean we've broken one early on in our and we'll get into that there's a lot of times everything from um is the most basic kind you know make sure that you're subscribed and you have notifications on um by doing that you'll get all the kind of cannabis academy updates at least i mean we've gone over almost all the basics now we'll start getting into guests guest speakers stuff on cbd i mean just all kinds of great things on it um i have to take this down just seeing a little thing on the corner of my eye yeah i'm like oh my eyes [ __ ] it's still bothering me like i could like i've been looking forward to getting into this one since we've been doing yeah academy because i i have a big huge debt so what it is is for everyone that doesn't know because we do forget sometimes it because we do this all the time and it's something we medicate on first of all we're not telling anybody to go and do drugs we're not advocating the sale illegally or anything we're talking about something that is recreational and medical legal here and we both have cards anyways prior to the legality so but we're just saying um this is wax crumble shatter dabs i mean really you can go on and on i'm just trying to associate the names that people might have heard how these things are all made the different levels of them that's that's that's weird [ __ ] man that's i go i'm way more into that one i want the one over there and like which one's strong i want that one yeah yeah how much oh that one's only thirteen yeah no no no no no go up go up higher tier diamonds not yeah you're definitely here i you're definitely a top shelf shopper i'll give you that one i like yeah yeah i like to have once you start really nailing in you know we'll get into that here in just a second the the really terpy profiles you enjoy it's really hard to avoid that and so when you want to get to those specifics you end up having to aim at that time and the terps are for like the land i'll give everyone the layman because i mean yeah i tell you what for everything everything i get into detail-wise you can just jump in with the lavender that is the flavor on the back of your tongue and the nasally like piney look there's a hundred different kinds of terpenes and it's any group of hydrocarbons that produce a certain type of flavor and different different terpenes not only deliver different flavors but different smells different effects and and so you it touches the back your nose some of the famous ones for those of you that are like well what's the term i don't even heard of terpenes before you haven't haven't you didn't even know it sometimes it's in the name of the strain you're smoking if it's lemon og it probably has a lot of the limo lean terpene in it which has that sort of lemon and a citrus flavor and smell to it and that's where you get that that terpene versus taste profile um so concentrate's been around forever yep forever so as far back as as um uh 10 000 bc in china they found um a hash keef mixture which was believed that they would take a bunch of sticky sticky wheat i had a 1990s cali they would take a bunch of sticky sticky weed and they would take a bunch of the keef and they would coat their hands and keef and then they would just rub the sticky sticky buds between their hands like this to all the trichomes would stick with the keef and get this layer of this sticky trichomes um the the trichomes are the sticky little parts and i'll get into that again in a minute too but it's the outside of the bud and that's where you're going to get a lot of the thc content and keef is usually what's in the bottom of a multiple stage grinder it's all the dried parts of that that's fallen off and it's the little crystals that have fallen off and the little hairs that have fallen off of the weed and so that keef is technically a concentrate in and of itself said grinder sorry that keep pretending to concentrate in and of itself but still i wrote it down but they would make that also there and so this this this hashish is is the first you know oldest form of the of concentrates it's been around for a while it's not a new thing but using science and technology we've really sort of perfected it and got into different options with it i actually early on in my years of smoking weed ran into concentrates something called hunting oil back in and so and they often call it co2 oil now they used to just take a normal cigarette and just roll it in this oil and then you would just and it was thc oil that's all it was uh basically they were like making butter for edibles instead using an oil like basically co2 oil is used by using co2 and pressure and and you can then squeeze basically out you can as if you're it's a reverse vacuum you know so instead of going into space where there is no air and then something explodes you're basically using pressure to squeeze out and i remember smoking being like what did he give us and he was like it's just it's just cheese he was like no i would never but but it's pure thc oil and if you're not used to that you're [ __ ] up now i was smoking flower that looked like it came over between rocks now there's too many two main kinds of concentrates and that's solvent and and solvent less or non-solvent solvent means you use you use something or usually a liquid but it can be a gas like co2 you use something to separate the the thc from the weed plant if you use something besides water pressure or heat then it's solvent-based if you use propane butane co2 alcohol like rick sampson oil rsoll super famous been around for a long time it's what they give the the little girls with cancer to give them to stop having seizures if they're epileptic you know it's rso oil we've done we have to be honest you can you can dab our soil you know it will puncture it in the face it will absolutely puncture the face now here's how they do rso oil we're not going to break down into how they do each and every one we'll save that for the more in-depth episodes but just to throw it out there how a solvent one works rso oil is a solvent-based um concentrate and this uh well what they do there usually is you'll get a large mason jar and you'll fill it full of weed an ounce or so and then you put alcohol in there and and the most common one is you do something like everclear and then you close the jar on that you give it about an hour or so and you you a little bit of agitation squeeze and strain and then you take this alcohol mixture that'll be a lot darker in color caramel in color that's dumped out it's evaporated and then what's left over is now your rso oil it's hard to judge exact concentrations amounts is it back bro not only is it back it is solely flying directly into mine just messing with you that one one fly that comes around only when we record and only so the rso oil that's an idea that's an example of solving the fly i am sorry i wanted it was mocking that's all right it was looking at my face most of your solvent-based concentrates are going to be between 60 to 80 percent thc now most of your solvent lists the ones that aren't using that process contrary to popular belief are actually usually equal to or stronger than the solvent-based extracts your solvent-less ones are just the heat water pressure those real real basic ones so like um the most common is when you just take like uh just heat and press you take a little weed put it between parchment paper two hot plates squeeze them together you squeeze hard and out comes the the product right which i want to do like immediately yeah getting that breath um so when you're also looking at these concentrates and you're hearing like the percentages because like i said i i want everyone to be safe and i have to break it down for like the moment by the way if you go and you're getting the vape pens um you're not getting the same the delivery of it isn't the same as if you're superheating it through a any kind of torch or nail or anything like that it's a predetermined electronic temperature coil so you're probably getting in the 30 to 50 range of it's stronger than flour that's why i included it in concentrates you're not getting the same don't think if you are pulling on a pen all the time and that's your way of of you're getting a you're getting a preset dope and then a friend gives you a dab rig that that is going to be the same as this because it's not it's not it's danger it's danger if you think that yeah that's the difference because it's like having a pill and being able to lick the pill every time you want to hit that's your vape pen or taking a pill and crushing it down and being able to snort that sucker all at once which would be the same which would be like would you don't condone in any way shape or form drug use or abuse telling you to smoke weed or concentrate or just given information it's a it's an over exaggeration of the the difference of of extremity between the two classes um oh you got it too so the i might have said extremity oh yeah that moment yeah i didn't i stuck with the extreme no it was good but i would have i could have i saved i might even talk about it i'm just very medicated at this moment so there's the different ways of consuming the concentrates you can either put some on your weed bowl if you're gonna have a pipe that's got flour in it a lot of people will take some of the softer ones like i like like a sugar or a crumble and you can put those down because those have a lower taste so good too does it have a lower uh temperature point tastes so good but usually often even then you won't get the full release of the terpenes in there because you're not reaching that appropriate boiling point or reaching point to release that um each one that whether it's solventless um which is just like i said the heat and water which is your bubble hash your hash your keef your rosin that means you're not using anything but the heat water pressure to get those notes now that's i'm like i need i need to have okay that's okay um um but i like this a lot of the more common ones a lot of the more common ones that are able to produce a desired texture or temperature point or the ones you usually see in the dispensaries a lot more often which is your wax your shatter um your butter your diamonds let me ask you you're gonna get those for a layman like maybe a little advanced layman why is shatter the one thing that's just lesser quality what what is that like just the most basic extract or so and i don't know actually it because it goes through less of a refining process it has more overall plant source material still in there taking up space for what would other be pure thc just the basics yeah it's a really it's a not as refined level of concentration be clear if you don't have don't dab shatter either you will get just a start small and no matter what type you're going to try start with the size of a half of a grain of rice that's that's the tip okay if it's r oil not i suggest you start with the size of half of a grain of rice that's the same that's recommended by uh other people you can check with uh potguide.com i'll put a reference there so it's not me saying it i'm referencing that you according to potguide.com half a grain of rice half a grain of rice of any concentrate type if you're charting it if it's your first time trying it you start with a half a grain of rice size yeah it'll get ripped and that way because you're gonna that's a potent amount no matter what type it is if you haven't tried it yeah us it seems like a half a gram right right because i do i'm thinking about i'm like no no i remember i remember starting off when it was just a tip it could be a little bit just on the end of the tool half a grain of rice would last you three different hitting sessions yeah in the very beginning correct because in the very beginning because we used to i the first way i did it was with um collector collector with a metal chip with a metal tip and it was silicone and so you would just kind of touch it to it yeah no half a grain of rice you're going to be ripped good luck yeah so start with that no matter which way you're doing it you know always start small start safe um start with the flour i honestly would say just from experience you do that little amount but i wouldn't start on shatter you can get pretty ripped that stuff's kind of dirty sometimes i would go like a real low end like crumble batter like get a lower i mean really shatter you can get you got to be careful with crumble because sometimes if it's a really soft crumble and it falls apart really easily huge hit you'll like something like a straw yeah or or the nectar collector is working but if you're stupid inhalation little device and you go to hit that thing like all right so this is it looks like a block let me go ahead and just take this little block and you go and do that and then all of a sudden a little chunk breaks off right up the straw and the whole thing's burning on the way out your necks are collected you can get a much smarter either i would say a scoop into a good i recommend an e-nail yeah but if you especially especially if you're a beginner then hit us up find somebody with an email learn how to use an email the reason being because you preset the temperature in a device and then it it won't burn it because you know for a fact it's going to be at that certain degree it's usually a little digital handheld corded i have one cough because you're not usually burning the dab too much and the reason he says that well not don't cough there's two main types when you're doing dabbing or using a rig which is like a a bong or a water tobacco device um if you're using one of those then you usually have the buckets on the end and you preheat them with a torch or using that e-nail which which electronically you know targets a certain temperature the two ways to do it are hot dabs and cold starts hot dabs usually use titanium nails because you can get them extra hot i mastered those without meaning to master because you just started that way i used to just not knowing everything and just dump everything in get it hot drop it put a spoon or something over the hole and try to survive longer take a second hit before it cools down bubble and lay on the ground like why do people like this like and then be higher than [ __ ] for the next while and then eat a bunch and take a nap and then wake up and do it again yes and i was like this isn't that great but it's so rough on your lungs instead you start by putting the material into the nail or the bucket on the end and then you preheat it slowly from the bottom until you start to reach that desired temperature and then you can hit it just as it starts to reach that temperature and so you're getting it right as it falls in the perfect green zone that has lasers to really to tell temperatures on his bangers i have a terp laser yeah you know how i tell my temperature okay i'll show you a couple different a couple different temperature devices yeah the laser gives you like it's like a rangefinder in golf except for heat here's that one this one right here oh that goes right in the camera i wonder if that [ __ ] with him he has more too i like this one do we have to put up an epileptic warning now at the beginning for the lights and the lasers i did it like 30 times did you i think you had i have used it you absolutely have to put a warning i don't know you have to put it yeah yes think about the other people that watch our stuff for the medication information and then some of them to treat seizures and you're like shining lasers and lights i'm just saying it looks super cool it did look very cool hurt my eyes so for all of you they got to see the warning at the beginning you're welcome uh he's an [ __ ] and that's why peace and right so the other option besides the gun epileptic warnings did you show that uh it's got a i don't know it's it's all lit up there i guess it's too bright it's a laser beam i can't but it shows a digital readout of the temperature you know of of your hand or whatever it is you're shooting uh 93 degrees apparently from here it says it's not supposed to be used on human skin because it's not accurate enough um and that's why but it goes into the plus or minus 10 degrees but you're using this to read in the hundreds and you know 560 640 320. so that's that one the other one here when it plugs in the wall this and plugs into different types of ends or bangers or nails whatever i'm using in that device and this is the email temperature controller this one this one specifically has a timer that will run up and down and then you can preset the temperature and it'll hold that exact temperature for this one particularly up to 90 minutes it'll also increase your medication budget twofold because it's on all the time and you're like oh well done i might as well just put a little bit more in there oh but oh yeah but on the reverse of that i don't think it does i don't think it does much because you waste nothing none at all you get every little bit oh no when it's both of us around you you get that almost every little bit at the exact temperature but i think we're trying to one-up each other all because you can just be like hey let me get a little a little bit more in there yeah yeah no it was it's fun though it's definitely worth the investment it's um so we definitely enjoy having all the support that we've had with the cannabis academy it's important to we always you know safely imbibe because now in the places especially that it's rec legal yeah a lot of people don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing i do want to also add just as a side bonus vaping or dabbing the dabbing vapors versus consuming flour smoke you know uh if you were to smoke a blunt say versus hitting a vape pen the the chemical makeup of of the vapor versus smoke the vapor sticks to your clothing less it it's so that the stink isn't sticky versus when you're smoking out of a bowl smoking flour and sometimes that scent will linger with you um and so you have a fleeting smell it's a very fleeting you'll walk something like cotton candy yeah what who's who had weed candy right now who had chocolate but it's gone and then it's gone yeah well sometimes you'll catch like if especially if you if you can show up right afterwards but no that's so much smelly like and the difference is that it's not a sticky um vapor so it doesn't stick to your clothes and then carry with you like the smoke from you know just no and this is just like a my side for beginners those vapes are just a different beast i don't really think they affect just be careful when judging tolerance just based off hitting those vapes i don't trust a lot of their potencies that you don't know these are hundreds of cartridges made i'm just saying i've smoked just like joints and bowls with people that rip vapes all the time and they get torched because flowers are a little different high or they are always on the vape and they think they do an edible no edibles different than everything don't ever forget that and like the concentrates outside of a vape honestly don't i just think of all the people we've gotten we have absolutely wrecked 20 at least people buy them attempting long-term smokers a lot of them too yeah not we don't ever do it maliciously but people come over we do a lot just don't i consume my normal amounts unless you're with someone that knows what's going on yeah i'm i am a seasoned concentrate user and if you have questions on it i mean if you like concentrates or the vapes obviously hit like and comment on what your strain is through the vape because i like those tasty ones like some of them that actually taste like like sugar cookies and yeah those are so good and that's gone and then we'll get into the specifics of you just sit there how do they make cookies how do they make diamonds birthdays how do they get a white cookie right here batter resin rosin um you know what's live versus not live because you'll see that sometimes it's your adverse lives you know so live is when the the weed itself is actually fresh frozen so it preserves the trichome you can hear that at some point too and one of the bud tenders trichomes are the little white kind of bulbous hair there's actually three different kinds of but think of them as as size small medium large but essentially trichome is greek for the word hair it's the little hairy um collections of thc that hang off the the plant you usually can't see them with the naked eye very much unless the plant is really potent otherwise you zoom in with a camera or something and look at them in a larger picture and some really cool stuff some really cool pictures i love the artwork you'll see out of those trichomes because it just kind of looks like a a whole different alien world when you're zoomed in on those things um they're great but so the the live process stuff is the live process is thought to preserve those trichomes a little bit better and so when you're actually turning it into the the end product you know the better off they start when they go in the more potent it's going to be on when it comes out oh whereas where you're just doing like rosin it still helps making the live rosin which is remember rosin is the one where we're just using heat and pressure to squeeze it together so if you start with the cold frozen wheat that you cured by by freeze for you know freeze drying it then you put that in between the hot plates and squeeze it out then then what you're working with is more potent than the solvent ones which broke it down a little bit to extract it whereas this one didn't get broke down you've preserved it the whole way through the process and so you're gonna get as potent as you can get based off of the flower you started with so if your plant is really potent then a live rosin will get you the most potent concentrate you can get out of processing that down into different forms like a wax which is using it to you know using a co2 or butane to separate it out and then turn that into a material i remember again some stuff years ago years ago the guy was making in his garage wax and it would be on like he drove me off into it probably on the [ __ ] whatever got me high and i would just i would just it would be wax paper you just pull it [ __ ] open and just be the stringiest well before it was garbage he was making it with like his feet or something look before there was but it was [ __ ] stony i'm glad you said that that's to bring up the fact that before they had little glass jars they were super convenient or little silicone jars some people prefer the silicone because you can hit right out of them you don't have to worry about is this glass or just dense plastic plastic one out there like oh this glass or plastic you don't want you don't want it oh no it is oh when you're here yeah i've taken a definite so chemical yeah i usually i usually real good about using glass jars and once i get a good glass jar just kind of scoop everything into that one um instead of using a plastic i don't get out of plastic you know the higher end stuff always comes into them higher stuff comes in a nice splash jars usually a ceramic jar something something nice we're bougie i'm a pain i want you to ever he has one that lights up yeah i do i have some that light up that's not i'm serious local local arizona dispensaries here yeah they have and i like their containers because they have a slightly magnifying lid on the top and then a little led light clicks on the bottom so you get a real good look in the container at the material without having to crack the lid and get a good peek at it you just okay that's looking pretty good i got about that much left you know and i like it that way and so i usually i reuse those often and just you know by the time i wipe them out i just throw another gram of something else in there um but yeah as far as store they didn't always have those so the original the original way to store your concentrate was the wax paper the parchment paper you know it's like a dirty diaper if it gets if it gets warm it'll stick both sides you know um so the benefit for that or the the way they'll say to really manage that is throw it in your little fridge i recommend highly keeping any and all concentrates you get of any form in the fridge the enemy of all concentrates is heat light and air and laying it on keep it sealed keep it dark and keep it cool and so you'll see a lot of mini fridges you can buy that are meant for like dorms that you know they fit six to ten cans of soda perfect mine so tell you it'll fit one case of beer you just well they're perfect little small fridges you know that would fit four or five of these but they're great for stacking your little containers in i have over here like a three-quarter sized actual full fridge that i can just keep like rows and of stuff in but that's because i dab a lot um that's a factual thing it is and with my with my little babies growing over here i plan to expand on my total amount of personal use i'm excited me too we always appreciate everybody jumping into the cannabis academy stuff um man there's so much to take in on all of the two if you have questions on any of the concentrate concentrate stuff definitely you can comment it hit like look forward to our concentrates 102 when we'll get more in depth to each one and beard 710 up on instagram really if you have a question or you know anything in regards to any weed content or the nooch 710 both of us i i have some depth if you want more layman's terms i'm the guy to hit up then if you want like well then you just do that you want to hear more about hydrocarbons then i'm the guy yeah i'm not um i mean no i'm not saying hydrocarbons at any point in conversation right now yeah right now yeah make sure to we'll keep the um cannabis academy stuff coming up uh when you're subscribing you have the notifications on you'll get that in your uh little annoying red thing and then and uh give us some ideas on what else because we're gonna start moving on to more advanced ones and if you think we missed some basics let us know put it in the comments we've had we've had a couple of people put them in there so if you think we missed something drop a line thank you he's been staring at me the whole time the whole time do you want anything you guys should say goodbye say goodbye to the fly everyone say goodbye", "0AeKFsbDbo8": "all right so we're going to be squashing there's like three different strains in here this nice keef nice pile of that we'll be squashing this at 170 degrees you want to wind strong said five times [Music] is should be a nice gusher of course you want to go low and slow on this too we'll double bag it awesome get a little bit of extra peg protection we got it all loaded up there double bagged all right as i said 170 on the press there [Music] and now we're gonna lower it down just to let it let the plates hit and of course we'll let it sit there for about about 25 seconds a little longer just to let it let it working cause that bag is kind of full it's been 25 seconds we're gonna add a little bit more pressure to it you don't want to over press this you don't want to press it real fast and heavy because you will have blowouts a lot of times if you do that so you want to nice and slow just you know feel it as you uh apply pressure if it's easy once it starts get a lot more rough pressure to it let it sit there and let that heat loosen it up a little more so it's kind of low and slow all right so we're starting to get it coming out on this this side right here so it should be coming out here a little bit more pressure all right so now we have it coming out right here down both right there and there all over there strictly i grade [Music] all the time all right we're gonna go ahead and pull this one because you know what if there's still rosin left in there we can still squash that bag again new strain news flash got the best grass got to take two and pass by no means average good god i got to have it babies are perfect and like the way you dream less smoke with friends uncle stone i like the way you dream it's yo dabbity we're gonna dab it dab it up we like the way you trim it this is a nice shield nice squash here yo dabbity we gonna dab it and of course you see there's still some stuff left in that bag so we will definitely squash that one more time all right this is uncle stone many blessings peace out my two favorite parts after squashing and making some beautiful rosin first one is gathering it so so [Applause] so as i said this was a nice yield of three different kinds of teeth no this i know there's definitely vanilla cush is one of the strains that was in this all right it's getting close to my second favorite part of this process that's nice all right now the fun part the sampling of it we like the way you trim it yo dabbity [Music] uncle love the way you dab so freak what they heard monster kong marketing", "Sdpn-iHpu_c": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving hope they got most of their Christmas shopping done all right we got a hall from cetera we got another hall I might try to do it tonight or tomorrow I might do a smoke sesh I got a fire burning out back so I might like to roll up a blunt and smoke that let's see what else oh if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the thousand subscriber giveaway coming soon I'm just trying to gather a few more things for it try to make it a little unique as possible you know me so make sure you hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we're trying to grow the channel as quick as we can as fast as we can get as big as we can so make sure you subscribe for all the latest videos so why is hoping now I just heard horn honk so I'm gonna cut this one off and hopefully go in there and help her with some dinner maybe or just sit on the couch and play with the kids wanted to so if you haven't subscribed subscribe leave me a thumbs up thumbs down comment down below let me know what you guys are talkin on tonight how was your Black Friday shopping did you bother go or did you go out and get anything today for yourself some weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "Z1_JJMsFR1U": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim for twenty-some Medical Marijuana review for those over the age of 18 if you're not a teen get out I'd like to say hard everybody out there hello how are you doing you guys haven't subscribed hit that button down there leave me a comment down below if you ain't got nothing to say just leave me emoji that's what I do and I got nothin to say I just throw up a peace sign all right let's roll one up and then we got a whole video today let's go for some sherbert seventy seven point three percent THC it's a little darker roll this up real quick and system member berries know that [ __ ] this is some mini as I picked up a bit the other day and then we do have a two different dispensaries we went to today so we'll get those knocked out here I'm sorry you guys can see that down there just so you could see the lava lamp decent-sized piece out there all right we got a real good sized piece they're just gonna see it and break some of that up in there maybe all of it and this like I said you could just sprinkle it right on top crumble with unless it's too hard then you have to kind of stop it or get crazy with it but if you can see with the crumble it does leave some stuff on your fingers so you're wasting a little bit that's why I kind of switched up to the wax whenever you can find it but I do still like the crumble because it doesn't melt real good out in the Sun for going to work and stuff I've said that before going to the beach sitting out in the backyard cutting grass whatever you got going on crappy all right when you're poking too kind of didn't seal there at the top I didn't lick it good so we kind of lost a little bit there trying to keep it in frame but not look through the camera as a painter but sometimes yeah well we poke that down a little too much just a tiny bit every couple times because some of you like to watch it roll some of you just want to get into the review so I try to mix it up to make everybody happy I have to do it let's light it up mmm never very taste good all right stir the flour back in here make a tiny heads up I wouldn't risk that grab that later all right so we got some halls today first one will do is move and talk about them make sure you stick around for the second one because I've got some interesting stuff going on and we got two of the live rosin I hadn't taking the labels off of these to give me just a second so we got the rainbow train wreck coming in at seven hundred and sixty two now you're gonna move the decimal point over one so it's gonna be seventy six point two okay get the label off this one to you guys sorry I wasn't real prepared I guess something this one's ripping on me sorry guys that's enough you can't tell what it is and then we got the black fire coming in at 758 so again we're gonna move it over one so it's gonna be seventy five point eight let's take a peek at these real quick now these didn't show up on the website but I know they got a delivery yesterday because they had a different strain of wax on there they had I can't remember what it was they had a crumble on there that was different and they didn't have last week so apparently these Rosen's are coming in small enough batches they're not putting them online so I'd say keep an eye if you're looking for the roz and keep an eye on their website and when you see they have new product just go in you can't call I tried I called the other day they said they didn't have any I couldn't get the guy in the call center he was a new one I couldn't get him to call over to the store but since they're only a few minutes away I figured I could run in there now you can see that one's got a little bit of a darker line in it it's a little different now they kept these refrigerated there somebody said not to refrigerate them because it was live Roz and I'm not sure I keep mine refrigerated now these again are 95 dollars a piece now I did use my loyalty card we're going to talk about that I seen a lot of stuff on another channel and then I seen a lot of stuff the other night on one a couple of Facebook groups alright first of all if your doctor does not carry the loyalty card call around your local area see which doctor does and just go in and pick one up they're not Pacific they're not numbered they didn't have your name on it and nothing like that so you can pick them up anywhere there is no move doctors that are just specifically for move some doctors are just too lazy to call also have to do is call move and move will send them a stack up they send them to my doctor my doctor is not affiliated with move it's against the law order for a dispensary and a doctor's office to be affiliated it's just throwing that out there I heard that was a bunch of stuff I heard on Facebook so hopefully somebody will post this on Facebook and straighten them out now if you remember I just my car didn't even really expire yet this was my last recommendation I used up all the flour I went to my doctor got a new recommendation and a new card which you can do that twice a year the only way I can get ahead on the flour so I had my loyalty card well I didn't have a loyalty card they emailed me one cuz I did the online doctor's visit so you don't even have the heart I have to have the hard copy at the moment because of the coronavirus you can just have your doctor email it to you get another doctor to email you one you probably have to go in there and pick one up unless you find a nice one that will email it to you they didn't look at somebody was saying they had an emailed one but it wasn't from their doctor they wouldn't accept it mine doesn't say my doctor's office mine says Josh whoever Josh was in the office that emailed it to me so just throwing that out there plus I haven't used any of my three things on there if you look at it the first one's 25% off the second one is 75 off 150 the third one is buy one get one free that's what I use today she told me I could use them in any order they prefer you to use them in their order they're there because it helps them keep track of it better but you're allowed to use it in any order you want she almost didn't let me do it because when she looked on there now this is a different something altogether I just used my buy one get one in February because you guys know move was an hour drive and I hadn't been going much and I was saving that last one for a rosin and I finally found some rosin in February so it looked like I just used it I'm like that's just because I just around got around to using it because you guys are so far away so I will go back tomorrow and use the 75 off 150 I've got something special planned for that one but you can use them in any order you can go to any doctor's office and pick these up you don't have to go to yours so hopefully that helps a few of you out out there that doesn't have a the doctors not using move or what have you and we can always save some money all right then we also stopped a true leave and we got a bag inside a bag I got two different size bags that you leave now apparently so I had to go back in twice because I did online order and they wouldn't let me add to it they was letting me add to it so I was getting I was getting one or two people every time I went in there that was real nice and they would just let me add whatever I wanted onto order today I had to order it and go back and go back again which was a pain in the butt but true leave has the clearance items now I got the sherbert clearance it's coming in at 74 74 percent THC now I only got one and I was kind of leery of it this was $42 it's 30% off you're getting the same discount as the employees and everything else they won't add no other discounts to it you can't do your points I wasn't allowed to use my points on this or anything like that now I was figuring this was old stuff that's why I really only got one if I've known different ID it got more this doesn't expire until 421 2021 so this is barely a month old right now it's always good for a year so they just made this it's not old it's just they had a little bit excess stock of it and this stuff looks really service what we just put in the joint so you guys seen the big chunky pieces of that this stuff looks a lot better it's a lot more smaller pieces but the pieces you can see the bigger stuff it is nice and a honeycomb look at that that stuff just looks amazing now the other one over there I think is 411 so this one's a little bit newer stuff looks good smells good and $42 guys so if you see that clearance if you go under shop under true leaving and look down it's got flour all that blah blah blah then you're gonna see the clearance click on that and it has wax pins it had the only concentrates they had was shatter and crumble like I said I would have got some the other night but I was kind of leery and figuring they was old stuff but so if you see I don't know you want to save some money grab that then we got some skunk ape crumble this isn't showing up on the website either one of you guys mentioned it to me and I think it was expedite I'm not sure if it was somebody else sorry so I did run in and pick one of those up coming in at 73 percent THC I haven't even looked at this one yeah this one was for 14 so the other ones newer and that this was full price and again we're more back into that slab a crumble so honestly the discounted crumble is the best-looking one that I got so far it's been hard to find indicas lately the only indica wax they had well they had a mandarin dream I guess they had Skywalker and that crescendo which I didn't really care for the crescendo and I still got Skywalker in there I still got meander and dream in there too but I really like this so you guys make sure you see the review on this which it'll be out soon and again this wasn't as butteri as the other stuff it has more of that granule look to it like it was got you know some sugar crystals or salt crystals or something you know I mean towards the other ones are more like buttery and these are more sugar it up granule so whatever you want to call them so I'm happy this one would still come out the same way so we do have a lot of reviews to go through now I was gonna I know I told me Qi 69 I was gonna pick up an RSO completely out of indica or esos not one in the whole damn building so I know couple have you been asking for those I never tried it but amici 69 Celtic Tech you they seem to really like it I've had a few other people say it really helps for you insomnia and my insomnia is kicking my ass right now I don't know if it's you know the added stress of the virus and all that other [ __ ] kids being home from school but I ain't been sleeping worth apart lately at all so I'll down some nasty old alright so if I have to and that was pretty much been what's stopping me I know it's not going to taste great I'm I know it's not I'm not gonna like the flavor of it but hopefully the effects will like concentrate tre there there's some crumbles there's some blue there's some shatters oh and I also want to mention a lot of you had asked if the rosin was stronger than the old rose and if it was stronger than the wax it was hard to say because the last batch I got was that triangle Koosh I had never tried triangle Koosh before so you can't compare Girl Scout cookie to granddaddy purple in a wax and one in a shatter they're gonna be different because they're different strains the rainbow train wreck I do have this and flower so I got a little bit of a comparison there the black fire I've had this before it's one of my favorite indicas I've still got some in shatter you can see how this has been here for a minute like it was March last year I've had that for a while yes I guess that's a year old huh I better use that up it's been at the bottom of the tray I keep it that's my go-to for when my insomnia gets really really really really bad so I been kind of I hide it on the body cuz gets a little dirtier than the rest and I didn't think it was that old though but but like I was saying so I've had the indica the Blackfyre in an indica before I've had it in chrome boy I've had it I don't think I've had it in Flour but I know the effects of it so we'll be able to say if it hits any harder in the ice or not so like I said we do have quite a bit of that turned around I know it got a little quiet there we're gonna have some how-to videos because I've got to do something my refrigerator is filled and I got two more Rosen's to put in there and that wax and they're not gonna fit those were pretty stocked up but if you notice this only come with one shelf and I kind of use this because it does leak a little water down there so I didn't want stick anything on the bottom but this really doesn't hold it's got the Skywalker in there and some other stuff so I'm gonna do something to this my little mini fridge remember that was my Christmas gift for 20 bucks Black Friday so we do have like I said a lot of concentrates I know michi 69 said she was stocked I think I got you beat girl but like I said I got nervous at the beginning of this epidemic thing I couldn't stock up on flour so I started stocking up on concentrates then they come out with the wax so I had to get some more of those to try that so I ended up with a lot of this crap so that's why somebody said I was dabbing a little bit more that's one of the reasons I'm trying to slow down the flour and try to get some of this stuff used up because I don't have more room in the fridge and if they come out with a new product or somebody else comes out with Roz and I don't have no place to put it so I hope that helps you guys hope that helps you with the multi-card like I said make sure you check out that clearance stuff is good stuff it's not old it's not discontinued there's nothing wrong with it this was the diskens item for $42 for crumble and it's the best-looking crumble I have

man today we get to talk about one of my favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no worries come you know do some fishing as well oh well i don't know man you tear it up a little bit too much [Laughter] i need my fish in my pond you're catching them all come on man i look forward to it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at cultivate colorado.com cultivateokc.com hey if you haven't already subscribed to our podcast please do that's the real dirt podcast with chip baker and check out our youtube channel man we're going to put all of our episodes on there from the past we're going to have all our new episodes on there so you'll be able to listen to all 70 80 90 episodes on youtube at your will so thanks a lot for joining us again today yeah man the next time you're out there in the world the next time you're at a dispensary ask the dispensary about solventless extracts ask them their opinion um ask them to show you some this has been chip with real dirt thanks again", "U9Z7leDSqFA": "doing so this is neil from grow pot chippy calm i'm gonna show you guys how to make rosin and that show that actually works so i'm gonna be using the auto stick shooter here it that makes its really crispy as you can see it makes really good I don't know if it's pronounced rosin or rosin it doesn't matter but anyway so basis where you use pressure and heat to make dabs rather than using you know butane is stuff like that so I bought this one here from best value VAX that's their website and stuff pretty cool I mean I've used other other products by them before and where they work good so anyway I set it to 57 and to 57 so that's the temperature it's a double play so both plates heat up that's important if you want to get nice a good yield from your from your weed now another way you can do this rather than just doing a straight bud is also prior taking your bud and doing making dry house but with ice or with dry ice and then the bags pretty easy to make I'll show a video on that if you guys want want to but in the future and show you guys the kind of you get much better yields that way and better flavor I'll show that but for now I'm gonna show you how you can take up you can take a bud press that on some nice dabs and it has a really good flavor everything I found to 57 to be a really good temperature I've tried all different types of temperatures so far and 2:57 I like it a lot I've even tried to 6300 so forth now the main thing is the pressure now with this device here when you first get it it comes with this this pad in here and it's really hard to close with the pad in it was what you want but the pad you don't want to use it it doesn't work as well and so when you take the pad out then it then it doesn't put enough pressure down so you have to do is you have to unscrew this bolt a little bit this bolt and hold the bolt between here and unscrew that as well and then keep unscrewing it until it comes down like you'll see this will start here and keep on screwing so this space comes down you have a big space between you and then take this bolt back up and retighten it again that lengthens it pushes it pulls this plate down further that way when you press when you press this thing down you'll get nice flat pressure now also when you press this thing down watch the time the timer start I have a sensor like 440 seconds I just you know look at the actual time it'll actually beep when time goes off so you can set it for 10 seconds whatever I just said it for that that way I can just guy and do it manually um just lift it up and when I hat when I hit that hit that thing so three second presses sometimes work on this thing the main thing is pressure so when you're making rosin you've got to have a lot of pressure so um yeah that's that's important so if you're using like a like a hair iron something like that a flat iron to do it make sure you're able to put a lot of pressure might want to take the flat iron apart and use some type of a vice grip or something that we can get a lot of pressure on it this thing puts a good amount of pressure you actually want it takes all my muscle and strength and weight pull it to push it down as you'll see here in a second but yeah really cool so alright so now it's go ahead and put it in so that you just take the wax paper I like to take a big long piece I can do a couple a couple turns on one piece of paper so I put it on kind of edge here this parts kind of hard to do as one hand but I think I can do it now I like to do is I like to do a three-second press just to kind of get the weed flattened out but with some weed even at this temperature a three-second press will actually give you a really good really good results so it's going like this and put all you weight down now it's press down really like that and you look that I've got you're careful when it pops up there's a lot of pressure that pops back up on you you take it out and as you can see it's a nice golden Asst I like to just take that piece and kind of pop it off like that and bam then you take this piece here some ikely I let it cool off sometimes sometimes not and you want to smash it and fold it up for your second press second press I'm gonna do ten seconds I like to let it cool off a little bit first though it's so kind of hot right now like that right there that'll be my second press then I take my little tool when I scrape it I'll show you guys what it looks like here you can see how look at that nice and clear so you can also use the paper itself to pull off itself but I find using the scraper is easier maybe I want to have any good descriptor if I look up kind of guys huh like manga eyes like the outlined scraper please all right so a little scraper tool here I don't know if I'll be able to do this with myself on camera let me just hold this for me I'm actually looking through the camera to see how I'm doing it's kind of weird once you get some on there it kind of like that's really good and just kind of sticks to what you've been pulling off and sometimes I'll just kind of get the last a little bit like that I'm just go ahead and try to zoom in on this and so you see that's not bad for a three-second press and look at nice and golden really good smokes really good absolute a flavor and stuff I will do a review of it again this is using six years or auto 60 tour so you know if autos just don't come out stone you know which most time they do you can just go ahead and turn them into rosin really easy if you use a hairdryer if you use a hairdryer you're probably gonna want to have it set to like about 300 degrees to get like a digital one because you're not piping up your product will push enough pressure to getting yields at three at 2:57 but if you can modify it to get enough pressure then yeah or you can you just buy something like this this mixer has dual heating course pull your weight down watch the time here when you go for 10 seconds I wait till after 10 seconds then I pull it off I don't think my trimmer in this face hurts and that's a weird angle push off like that and this is all real time so everything you're seeing here is actual real time of what I'm doing so I have another good amount sometimes this hit might taste a little better the three-second head so sometimes my girl film take that hit first before I scrape second yeah all the scrape on their side aside the floor and this will still get a third press the third press though starts getting darker in color and changes the flavor a little bit so the third process is nice I'll show the third press looks like an ice cream on the other side look at that's a good that's actually a good amount right there they're just kind of giving idea as I'm fully cooled off yet but it's pretty stable and it comes out like out like a wax and like a nice stable wax I take it here kind of smash it you can see it's a it's a nice table actually can you can peel off of all right so we'll do the third press really quickly here for ten seconds I again I fold the padding half cup times that once I'm done with these patties I save them all up then I make our so out of them now I know notice this was all kept on here this is why I do this right it's now watch now I can take this whole entire piece of paper and I can put it inside my machine again with just that side in only that way I'm not ruining anything on the other side so I can actually keep that on there sometimes I'll do a little bit longer than for the third time good it's a little bit longer direct about 12 seconds let's come back over here [Applause] and you can see the third press starts to get a little bit darker I might go get a fourth press out of this but I'm gonna stay before so that's gonna count a brown paper bag go ahead and hold it one more time let's get this last press off of here and see it looks like it's all together you guys saw the side the butt the size of the butt is just a pre normal size but it wasn't super big I should have waited first but didn't really think about it I'm recording all this before I go to California so I can have videos the post so the third the third press you know you don't get nearly as much stuff and I can actually show you it's also not as stable it's also still a bit warm so it's not like sticking to my hand or nothing like that I can actually work with it but you can see the size difference this pre tremendous what the other one was two presses as well so anyway it's nurse you can all see the difference in color while you can see that let's put up the labor trick not too too much difference of color you can see that the the other one is a little bit darker so all right guys I'm sorry about the camera so she felt you found all over the place well I'm sure I'm just trying to stay awesome like I do it's all right suppose you get a last look here trying to get it to focus sorry ma'am you can see this one here starts to get darker it starts to bring out that a little bit of the actual plant material not that material but you know the whatever that's called that makes your hash green when you make ice hash look at that though it's really nice so anyway I just wanted to prove that a lot of people doubt that this [ __ ] works so the Rossum press works at first I had my doubts when I tried it with the without this machine when I try it with his hair dryer I'm like I don't know or the hair flatten tournament sorry and straightener I'm like I don't know and I had it set to with my plant with my [ __ ] laser Tim Gunn I had it set to 300 degrees and I can press I press so much I actually broke the the flattener because I can put a lot of pressure even with all that pressure 10 seconds I had to do it for to get any decent yields but it was really dark wasn't light like this so 257 if you can get a machine that you can adjust and give you a good amount of pressure then yeah there's other ones on their site too there's a smaller version but I think it only has one heating element so I'm not sure how well that's going to do for yields and stuff but just make sure you can you can just it this one I know you can adjust to make it have a lot of pressure and so I'll just you know your weight so in order to use this thing we want to do is you want to go like this when I stand up and then I jump on it with all your weight just push all your weight down like this boom and see that it's like really push weight down like it takes all my weight to really push this thing now that's how much weight you want you want it to wear has a lot look when I release it that's with one arm when I release the thing watch it wants to knock my arm up like that I gotta kind of like really be careful cuz it can like knock you back and I actually want to make it where hasn't me a little bit more pressure yeah you can buy super expensive machines to that you go you need to put like tons of pressure on there then you can use a much lower temperature and get like pretty much really steep chatter but as you can see this right here it's a pretty damn stable I mean it's not it's not quite shatter and see if I can do this well I'm half my girl and help me right so that's mine so if you like if you grab it you know kind of cut it and you can pull it it snaps you know it's it's pretty much snap and pool it's not like super super shatter you know let me look that's pretty stable so it's not quite wax not quite shatter somewhere in between what I mean it's easy to work with you know you can just yeah we can break it apart like that and you can see it has a shadow quality to it so it's it's nice stuff to 57s I've tried 250 and I just you don't get as good as yields but yeah so the 257 seems weren't really good works better than the tube in the 260 even so yeah awesome cool [ __ ] trying to get it off the tool here see the tool hot sticky stuff on it so that's why I wants to stick to it but it's not too bad I mean for all that right there off of one little bud if you get pretty good yield so I'll to show you guys they yield per weight like way the bud and weighed the way the rosin after or rosin after and see what kind of yield to get something bud and then the next thing to do is to make some dry some dry hash which the bassist looks like Pauline you know and then take that and put it inside of a 20 micron naturally under 80 micro mesh you put that full that blends out here and smash it and supposed to be really good yield so I don't try it yet so let's see what happens all right guys double peace peace I'll be in Cali yeah Universal Studios and beaches air yeah three years yeah three year anniversary that's what we're celebrating", "4WqaQPE_M9c": "Wister the YouTube chef voice I'd like coming through with another quick video for today man today I'm gonna be giving you guys a little bit of info on the 710 labs list so makes you guys we're coming if he knew hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you dab what's the deal boys y'all already know what's happening man I'm coming back with another quick video me give you a little bit of information about what's going on here so as you guys can see I got my delivery from the list this right here came from 7-10 labs personally they hand-delivered me this package full of bomb ass extracts and whatever else I ordered that you guys are must take a look up right now what is the list how do you get on the list where is the list man it sucked because actually the list is currently only available in California now the list was made for only friends family and true OGS of the 710 community you can go to 710 labs.com and find out how you can apply for the list sometimes it's open sometimes it's closed with 710 labs actually does is put some of their best production of every month to the side for people who are on the list if you're on that list then you pretty much get dibs before any dispensary in California that's supposed to get their supply for the month or whatever so once you get on that list you have first dibs on all the stuff that 710 labs made for that month on a certain day of every month 710 labs is gonna email you a link and the password you use that password to sign in on the website that they sing you and then there goes the whole list of everything for that month you have to be careful because whatever you pick and you purchase you cannot change you have to spend the minimum of $300 and the maximum is whatever your tolerances for recreational use the max that can deliver is 8 grams of concentrates so you can only get 8 grams of rosin or you know dabs or whatever if you're a medical user that you can actually get up to 50 grams and the same goes for the flower if your recreational user that you can only pick up one ounce of flower twenty eight point five grams and if you're a medical users you can actually pick up eight ounces of flour so that's pretty fired they actually delivering a lot of cities up in Northern California and here in Southern Californians they deliver in a couple cities as well so that's gonna do the basics of the list let's get right into the package as you can see they delivered it in this nice sick ass bag labeled 7/10 Labs has 710 labs on both sides and you can actually take the bag apart if you would like to or you can just keep it together and you know rock it like a little duffel bag and on the side right here has the perfect note that this got a 710 labs booklet and you actually got this handwritten note so it's gonna be a handwritten note with your name on it big old paragraph talking about yeah you get it what's the dilly it's very dope you told me I'll [ __ ] with that how they just write you a note and [ __ ] with your order that's pretty sick that's like a lot of love so as you can see you got two zippers right here we're just gonna zip them fangs openness in this inside you might want to check all the compartments cuz you know how smokers get man they end up putting joints all in the cutting [ __ ] but uh yes so here you got ice packs this is gonna be a 710 labs ice pack which is pretty [ __ ] sick yes and then you have all your rosin or whatever that's you ordered you have your whole order in here if you got flour that I'm pretty sure the flour being here to anchor no flour on this order and sometimes they give you goodies and [ __ ] so sometimes you might have like a pair of socks or a t-shirt or whatever they're giving out for the month you might have something special you might have some couple of joints like you never know so just check the whole compartment and as you can see man I put in a pretty nice order because the prices are ridiculous I mean wholesale you're paying forty-five fifty dollars for a gram I mean you can't get this quality anywhere for this price usually I go half with my homie he'll get like two hundred dollars worth of things I got like $100 worth of things argue like 150 he'll get 150 or whatever the cases and then you film it'll be easier on both of us and get some high quality [ __ ] for the good price and we can still be on the list because if you actually don't order if you start like skipping your orders and like not ordering anything because the minimum is too high or whatever or whatever your case is like you're on vacation or whatever the cases if you keep missing out on making the orders and they're gonna cancel you from the list so you guys got to keep placing the orders I mean they do it at a very good time I would say it's pretty convenient like monthly it's not like every week or every two weeks you gotta put in $300 so um it's really like right around the time you got a smoke if you just save all your money and then make the order then that order should last you for like the whole month or until next time you have to order you'll probably even have some [ __ ] left over so I think it's really convenient especially if you have a buddy that's really interested in these products or whatever just interested in high quality [ __ ] and I want some new [ __ ] they can put it in the order they got all type of [ __ ] as you can see from [ __ ] dabs rosin bunting BHO they got joints they got dad pins like they got the high quality spires if they got the high [ __ ] bomb-diggity flour they got everything but um I only got Rosalyn because right now they didn't have anything on the list that spiked flour and they have any flour on the list all they had was rosin and dabs and joints but uh yeah maybe next time I'll get some flour this is what I picked up man I picked up some Munson number 58 I picked up some [ __ ] called the loot it's gonna be a Percy live rosin another Percy live Rosalind called greasemonkey number 15 times bootylicious number 1 I picked up a regular live rosin another month's in 58 some of these are gonna be doubles because where they're like 45 bucks each so it was like why not I got the live rosin and sour tangi times bootylicious whoo that was like another what $45 one sour tangi bootylicious again I'm telling you the Lemonheads number four so you get a good make sure you get a chain you get to change it up and [ __ ] and then you get to you know pay a really good price so the booklet man you got a couple of Snickers I believe up in here oh they give you your receipt as well and then they just show you how to smoke this [ __ ] the right way so you got the weed instructions you got all the rosin and dad and live Persis and different types of [ __ ] that they make these got the instructions behind them and stuff so I really respect that they put a lot of love and hard work into the [ __ ] versus people who just give you a box of weed or whatever like yes that's what that is like they actually care what they're doing with their [ __ ] so that's pretty tight you know I'm pretty happy I made the list so that's pretty much it man you film you got your [ __ ] you got on the list you got your [ __ ] you pay cash and then that's it they come they pull up they text you they're like yo you want us to come at this time or this time and you blow yeah come at this time they'd like alright then and actually come right on time too and they keep this [ __ ] in good condition though it's cold it's frozen it's ready to go in the freezer or in the fridge or whatever it's ready to get smoked I really [ __ ] with that so man that delivery service is a [ __ ] one anybody on the list make sure you hop on that damn list boy I know y'all enjoying that [ __ ] because this shouldve sick as hell you got the bag you got the ice packs there's nothing I can really say man but if you guys mention his video I appreciate y'all for watching guys we're coming if you knew hey that subscribe button for ya boy it makes you get to an incident excellency [Music]", "DICJxd3Rb-E": "alright y'all we're about to do this source turbo and you can see how frosty cold that is we got the Everclear see how frosty that is or I'll pour that into here do a quick wash on it yeah things like never seen tipsy bartender yeah lookout broke it all down already every bit of it's right off them stems and everything look that was big bud big hold bugs broke it down to nothing so this one we're gonna do into the magical butter bags but which one did you pay I go ahead and do that and then put a little bit in one more [Music] I shoulda left that little bit for was to wash that out look how the color on that can you see that we got the ice on top of this source turbo getting it ready because that ice helps the condensation where that alcohol rises to the top that's the crucible here I wish this was silicone on the other side they have a bigger one of these that you can get all right into the fill line good wash on it now go ahead and put it on in here and you make sure when you're putting this down you don't thread it too hard as soon as it catches it's done this is just holding it straight up some of the caches it's done you put your lid on I like to have it to where it's Lance forward no particular reason put that on not sure how well they can see it from here but one of the reasons to use the bags you can see the hash and if if you don't filter them particulates will be in your concentrate yeah cuz that went through 190 but not D 25 all right so you turn on okay and then I hold it in for four seconds [Music] what it's doing now is creating a vacuum pressure so it'll suction that lid to the top real good and create a vacuum in there that's going to help that alcohol your eyes to the top that vacuum pressures will take all that alcohols will rise to the top condensate and then it's going to come to the front right here and you know see it collect right here it's gonna be about make his turbo mode is which is for goes for two hours so we'll be back in two hours and see where we're at [Music] cleaning out everything got that Jordan Bisset clean ran it through the hunted by doors and getting everything last a little bit put through it give you a good view of what the material looks like after it's been washed now those were whole bugs when before we shook it and everything just popped from the stem or anything now you can reach down in there and squeeze it and you tell like there's no sticky left to it or anything and some people say while you get rid of it you can't do much with it people do though actually I you could actually throw that in the magic butter machine when you do your next tincture and I mean you may get something you know I know plenty of people on our magic blower page who swear by the slugs and that's basically what that is do we use the hunt for when we filter it the first time and that catches all the material and then we use the 25 my column on the second because normally when you're doing making hash or something that's fine come to you but you pull it all out it'll look like some long hash that alright so this is the next day Sunday this thing basically ran all night I keep adding in the alcohol and as you can see we're in a good amount of alcohol reclaimed already and you see how clean it is [Music] so yeah we'll see I'll be back later we're almost done it's been in here since yesterday so we got a little bit more to go we had to empty the alcohol because it was up to the line but there's the alcohol never clear you can see how clearer still is so we'll reuse that I'm gonna start her back up all right so I'm gonna stop the source here and you're released a vacuum down blow warm this time just a bit poor I'm putting it in a silicone so that it can get a little more out of there all that alcohol you need to get the rest of it so use a silicone spatula you can see the color of that not bad at all it's not all the way done yet I got it on my finger and feels like like crumble almost they take this crucible here you take this you put alcohol in that again and you run it you can get the rest of that out there work ain't worried about it wipe it out with some alcohol all right so right here we have the final product see it's coming off just like shatter nice and shatter e and then right off there see how golden that looks pretty good that's pretty good all right I'm gonna break out the Aurora here get her heat it up you know - look here that's what I just made in the source turbo I taste real nice robots there you go smokeable dabs out of the source turbo quick out co-wash although it took overnight but minimal effort I think I ended up with actually a gram and a half out of that to grams almost all right guys so here's the alcohol we have reclaimed out of the dabs we just made so we got basically all of it back that's crazy and it's got a little a little bit of a tint to it but not much a little bit of a yellowish tint and here is my pucks that I smash when I make dad is in the rosin press so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this reclaim alcohol I'm gonna use it again somebody stuff for my edibles I'm gonna take this and shake it run that through the magic butter machine and then with the rest of that that I have I'm gonna take all these bags that I press in we get everything I can get out of those it's really cools I press some CBD this time so there's gonna be CBD in here too bring that out and put that in with that right there and then when I take this out of magic butter machine I'll put it in that source and I'll get 80% of my alcohol back on that because I won't get as much because they'll still be left in like some of the sludge in this people use that 13 capsules and take it I think people put it on brownies too so you can use every piece of this butter machine 130 for 8 hours all right we'll see you like subscribe comment set your notifications you make sure when you're done cleaning out I always like clean it with some isopropyl some 91% put a little bit in there and make sure you get it all nice and clean I do the same thing with that clean it all around so make sure you clean it up good clean the lid it collects moisture up under this so make sure you clean everything good cleaning out my bottles my mason jars here so make sure it's all clean for next time we'll see you then one thing this comes right up out of there really easy so you can clean up around in the edges in here cuz right here it collects you know moisture and everything so make sure it's all nice and dry when you put it away so it comes right out", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] so [Music] so

this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 if you're not 18 get out of here all right like say hi to everybody out there hi to new subscribers old subscribers and you know soon-to-be subscribers that's right that's you if you haven't hit that button hit that subscribe button now leave me a thumbs up and a comment and I guess hit that Bell I guess their Bell says that [ __ ] too alright we got a one plant a video for you today I never did show the flower I got so we'll do that and we're gonna review the live rosin resident rosin it's live something alright we did pick up a little what the heck is it open Ella berry pie this is an indica leaning hybrid I believe come in at 15% not bad I've been smoking on this one got a little bit of that purple in there not bad trichomes not covered like some of them have been here lately but one thing I do like about one plants they got those tamper resistance on there so you never have to worry about somebody else opening it up in the store sticking their big gnarly nose in there and dropping a booger in their nose hair God knows what else some people like to open these in the store I don't like the fact that they can open them in the store because like I said you never know who's stuck their schnauzer in there goes no I don't want the cookies got a little purple in there too mmm smells good there's a big mug in here it looks like our two baby nugs having sex something I don't see that sit down there oh and if you guys aren't on instagram check me out on instagram well if you're not on history and get on Instagram I know a lot of people said they're bored sitting at home don't have anything to do this is the time to learn something new figure out Instagram it's not that hard you don't have to be yourself you can block your profile so nobody even can see who you are and I do a lot more bong rips and stuff like that on there because my camera is up on a box there way down here so I can reset the camera and shoot like a 10 second clip of taking a hit I'll stop and you can see the function I could do slo-moes over there and just edit the whole video to sort set the camera up to slow-mo and do one slow-mo video and be done so I don't have to edit anything still so just throwing that out there like so if you guys aren't on Instagram get on there this is a good time like I said if you're stuck at home bored there's a lot of giveaways on there a lot of live feeds I was on there live with or I wasn't on their proper major quality did a live thing and I joined in on the live talking to him a couple other ones was in there Liz was in there so it's a nice little platform you see a lot of other people that make comments on the videos they're usually on Instagram stuff like that speaking of that that Liz the one that introduced me to the bowls from Harold lumen or whatever it was she just wanted some smudge oh screens and a real nice little I think it's a recycler it kind of looks small like the MJ Arsenal rigs there was a different brand so like I said there's a lot of different stuff on there also while your home board this is a good time if you thought about trying something or learning something the Internet's out there you can learn almost anything on the internet so this would be the time my friend to learn all that crap and guess about it they'll add some more stuff to say and usually I do but at the same time I smoke before the video instead of during the video this time so having some memory issues there's that Darth Raven that stuff doesn't look good that's my new tray from the fat-ass glass sick little design like I said it this is like a greyish purple but it's look good alright now let's talk about the live resin rosin let me pop this back in here do a little whole pack of that for that their containers are weird I keep one to turn it upside down I keep thinking the whites on the bottom and that's the lid but it's not the lids plastic so it's live rosin like I am so like I said the lids plastic the glove the jars of glass with some kind of like reflective on it and then it's painted black or something like that it might have been a sticker but I don't see anything under there so weird little jars she haven't used some of it it smells good as note that's coming right it does have a good smell to it taste not so much and I think the reason being is this is the take a lid off this was the organic blend coming in at 73 percent so this was a blend of Kim D which is Kim dog see if I can multitask and break up a little nugge and take a hit to get a little more forgetful time I take this out jarred it looks like less flour so it's the rosin the live rod now this is live rosin so they freeze the plants right off as soon as they come down they don't dry them out they're still green wet and they freeze them and then they come back and pretty I'm pretty sure they make bubble hash out of that so they do it through the screens and then they press the bubble hash into rosin so that being said that's a blend it skim dog evany Kim dog which is a hybrid evany and ivory which is a sativa leaning hybrid strawberry maraschino which is mainly a sativa and vanilla berry pie which is an indica leaning hybrid so it's got a regular hybrid a sativa hybrid a sativa and an indica hybrid for one I would have thought that would have been fire now might not taste great but you know me and my combos I like the combo DUP I get better relief on combos this I didn't get that I smoked a wax joint with us in it and did three dabs at the same time and still wanted to come back out in the garage and do something else so it didn't hit as hard as you would have thought it would have especially for having like I said four different varieties in there now here's what I know I know I did a lot of ohms sorry guys the maraschino cherry they haven't had that in stock in a while so I don't know whatever they grew this last time they just put straight to concentrate or if that's something that's been in the freezer for a while I don't know if that has something to do with it if there's a shelf life on frozen bud I'm not an expert in that department I've never froze any bud flower really doesn't last around long enough to be frozen but like I said in the taste it didn't have I won't say it had a bad taste cuz it wasn't bad tasting at all it was just I think a little too much going on in there you could taste some of that Kim D which I'm not a I've never really had the Kim D but I've had the Kim Seba and they said all the Kim's kind of have that same gassy kind of taste to them kind of something similar to a gorilla glue or something like that so you definitely get that Kim taste in there and probably the next thing that you could probably tell in there would be that vanilla berry pie and then there is a little hint of strawberry in there but like I said it's more of a jumbling so I just think there's too much flavor in it I wasn't impressed for the hundred and five dollars that stuff cost luckily it was on sale or what on sale but I use code new fam for 25% off your delivery we will take a dab of it though yeah it's only ten minutes then we'll do a dad real quick and we'll call that one my new rig here I got the temperature down this one rather quickly usually it takes me a while to get the temperatures going on these things and some of them I still never quite all the way on some of them I still caught my butt off when I take a hit this one I'm doing a little better also I got this in there should have done this at the beginning of the video this is a splitter so you can do two at a time anybody ever use these what are you using for do you use them - dabs or to use - for flour or do you do a dab in a flour which is best let me know down there in the comments I've never used one so I have no experience with that so like I said if you guys have used one let me know I'm really digging this new down beret go use the m'kay Arsenal one a few times still haven't quite got the temperatures down on it yet or the times still making me coffee a little bit I can clean that one quite as good as I should have last time it was late last night while I was smoking will use the carrot dabber which is kind of nice it stands up on its little stem it works real good for the goopy stuff of course once you use it once and it gets a little goopy on there because it always leaves a little resin you can pick up wax and/or crumble and stuff like that I was doing it the other day this one's almost cooled off so we'll take a DAB and it will probably call that a video so if you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe if you want to try one plan out try them out for yourself use that code new fam for 25% off online orders also they got stir-crazy that's going until I think the 15th of the next month you guys see that very little coughing too soon that one is working pretty good I just said the flavors not bad I would like to try this in something else besides the Kim the Kim dog or the blend that's all I did see on the site that the Kim dog ran out before I got on there but the blend was all they had left so and like I said this is a live resin so it's going to be green plants frozen then made bubble hash I believe and then press that bubble house into rosin take one more hit out of this that's my the pipe from the fatass glass Bert 420 also has one similar to that but is yellow with more bumps on it I like mine better it's like a blue rooster or something little punk rocker with some [ __ ] up hair alright guys hope everybody's doing good out there we've got some more wax videos coming up this week cuz we bought a lot of wax cuz that's the only thing we can stock up on we can only get so much flour in our 35 days you know that so I really didn't want to keep going back and forward to dispensaries so I got a lot of wax last week so we'll have some more reviews coming I do have a weed box too and open up we might do that tomorrow or the next day it's sitting over here in the corner begging to be opened up and you know me I got open that thing up so hopefully everybody's doing good this videos for XP DJ he wanted to see the live resin review sorry it was a little better like I said it's not bad it's just got a lot flavor in there and it doesn't hit as hard as you would have thought it would be for four of them in there it's really kind of a mellow hi to it to be honest so that's gonna be it guys until next time I don't have a join but keep on poking my friends", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "3IIvPYyCmZc": "everybody how you doing I know it's a little late but we're gonna do what I promised we're gonna press a half ounce of this African Thai okay I've got the flour completely rehydrated with spinach leaf it's ready to go sure you can see it right here make sure that can you see it there in the camera it's looking good yeah good people see them how nice it's glistening in there yes it is Jake how is it keep it in focus by pressing the screen right where it's at so it refocuses on the flower you see that yes okay I'm gonna get closer how's that yep yeah that's a half-ounce african time this stuff is ringing in at thirty four point eight percent okay let's go - lets go strength so we got the CRD kt20 trip tech rosin press at 200 degrees I'm using a duly tech 160 micron 14 gram bag and we're gonna load this thing up this spinach leaf is crucial to rehydrating this flower and when you see the kind of yield we're gonna get from it you'll understand why I tell people over and over again you got to get your flower right to get the most out of it out of Raza okay I I don't can't say it enough I hate to have people come by and they bring me flattered and I can't press inform but sometimes that happens and that's cool I mean you know lesson learned and and but I've got this stuff rehydrated to the proper moisture content and no I don't use a moisture you know gadget to figure that out this is a craft I do this by experience by feel I get a little finger - who cares it's my medicine yeah you know I'm pressing for another patient I wear gloves because you know it's their stuff you know anything I'm pressing on cameras is either mine or it's a customer that doesn't care whether I wear gloves or not because they know I you know good steward of this plant if but this stuff is so soft I mean it's it's amazing in the yeah but it didn't mess with the herbs in fact I think the extra moisture on the springs really brought them out kind of like when you're in a shower you're not gonna have that moisture hits your nose and saturates everything you know that's it's kind of the process here so you see even though this bag isn't really designed isn't isn't really designed for be doing bottle textile okay it's made to be flat packed but I've gotten it to adapt to where I need it to be it's just the stuff is so stinking then you know I'm coming up with finger ashes trying to get it to fill in the bag and make a slug that I can it makes it hard get between those plates right oh my gosh I love African Thai and see the thing is nine times out of ten sativas don't produce as well as indicas except for peligro up from grass roots which was an absolute gusher and this African tie is insanely insanely good on its yields when properly pressed you know and everybody has their their own temperatures that they want to depress things that I'm just doing kind of a pre squish here to get slugged up right I can't believe that was a half yeah no I know crazy huh we also saw right boy stur eyes are so now I just trimmed right I just trim about you know half to three-quarters inch above all right get rid of that don't need that this come in here watch the camera make sure that everybody can see what's going on yes okay so now we've got our slug right stage that here I'm gonna take and move this lighting over here so if you get a little nice view of this press please bear with me as I move the camera around I don't do fancy edits and stuff like that my videos are are wrong and kind of like this because I want people to see this is real life this is how I operate my results are my results you see them good or bad I don't try to hide a thing okay so I got my mic 18:20 press set up to 200 degrees I got the paper in there we're gonna take the slug there's your slug we're gonna put that in there we're gonna place together just a little bit give it okay we got it centered in there now that I got it centered in there I'm gonna bring this view in a little closer for you so bear with me as I keep readjusting the camera angle here until I get it centered so you can see what's going on okay so now if you guys want to see something cool use that as a monitor and watch because it's in maximum scale or 200 degrees and we're ready to drop the hammer on this gently okay this handle is weighted yeah so it it brings the place together in a very controlled way when I start meeting resistance and I hit my first heat soak point which is where I want to stop and let the heat start working in the material and all that moisture that we reintroduced into that flower turns to steam and forces all the good [ __ ] that's that's how this works that's why if your flower is dry and it only is from the dispensary I don't care who makes it yeah what kind of Evita packs they use see see it's starting to moist moisten up right there let's see that okay so I've got to get this ready because this stuff is going to drip when it starts producing it's going to be insane oh it is gonna be awesome happy plants treated with love pressed with care and you get some amazing medicine see every time I starts to get fuzzy just tap the screen right on it and it'll refocus yeah okay so try to get the lighting said you can continue seeing the best view of things now I'm still not at the heat some point it's already producing already starting to moisten up see on the bottom edge on the left-hand side air it's getting wet it's getting wet up top Oh she'sshe's gonna be a gusher guys tonight always I always love those gushers oh yeah African type Ellen Roya another one that's an indica though is Prime's double Afghan show yes I got my first very first time I pressed rosin was with a nut smasher mini press Preston a - that didn't rehydrate and got 1.1 brand Wow and I thought oh it's gonna be like this forever yeah it's not yeah and a lot of learning later and I'm at where I'm at now so this is something anybody can do it you could do it with a hair straightening iron but if you want to have results like this you say you need you need to love this plan do you really have to love this plan guys want to try and rely on timers and gauges and think that it's scientific this is an art not a science so you have to know what this plan is showing you look at the color the camera doesn't do it justice with the lighting I mean I get that it's super blonde yeah now you see how the handle is starting to come resistance but it's still closing the place okay slowly and not too aggressive and I don't have a blow-up my god I'm not in a hurry I want to get it flowing so that when I tipped this thing 90 degrees forward that's it's going to say I got to keep messing with the angle of the light to get it to not amber up like that it's it's always kind of a pain because it reflects off of the paper and then it throws off the camera see I get it just right look at that happy plant problem she is so happy I just hope it doesn't auto butter cuz it did that on one me on time it auto sugared up it didn't flow I think this is going to flow it I'm gonna get it that particular batches lipids aligned a certain way I mean that's what we're dealing with here that's why rosin is a much better concentrate and most of the commercial stuff because everything that's in that plant is in that Roz and I haven't taken anything out I've just removed the plant material right in the equation yeah I'm taking the soul of this plant and I'm bringing it forth it's giving me its essence and that's that's what somebody who cares about what they do can do with this plan with the right equipment now I'm going to give it a little help watch the material move look at its like lava yeah now we're gonna do something watch this guys I'm gonna back this back off right move my lighting we're gonna get it shining down on this right here because what you're about ready the season to be very cool you want the camera down there I will yeah I need the camera down there okay now we're gonna get a gravity assist and we should start seeing some tryptych real soon if you want to take your cameras guys if you want to put stuff on your phones put it on your on your Facebook just tag me okay you know make sure you tag prime make sure you tag African Thai and Ciardi okay cuz it one chance to look at that look at that look at that that's common okay look at that okay so I'm gonna take the camera at the free hand here I'm gonna bring you in and show you look at this look at underneath look that is drip tech my friends see Rd makes the best drip tech presses for prices that nobody else can deal with look at that and it's African Thai 34 for almost 35 percent thirty four point eight mile Carberry and just look at what it's given us here we rehydrated it with care and just there's look at how gorgeous that is getting nice close-ups and as soon as it gets off the heat its it gets nice and stable right away it stabilizes so it's it's gonna implant it if you ever get this stuff in a concentrate form and you try the rosin you'll know the difference just immediately in in every aspect of the flavor profile this is as close to actual plant consumption as you get everything's still there you know look how thick it is - I haven't even really started putting a ton of pressure on it yet either guessing there's so much more there is and that's why I'm not rushing this process because see I can feel when the bags getting to the point where you can't press them right so I'm trying to do this one-handed well on that well I'm still applying pressure so I'm going to let it sit there but bring this in so that you can see look at that beautiful medicine right there god I love this plan I love doing this for both myself and other patients too this is this is what brings me joy I used to think it was being a soldier but this is really the thing that's given me the most satisfaction in terms of something positive to do with my life since I was a soldier it means that much to me that's why I've dedicated myself to teaching people how to do this this is all about making better medicine when you take that flower look at that dripping look up underneath there is insane there's spider webs coming off become wet look at that look at that they crazy Oh baby wait'll they see this on you - they're gonna lose their they're gonna lose [Music] see this I said look you keep you kill back under here and you can still see it's still just gushy discussion my god is there any end to this look at this oh man I'm gonna get a record off of this I don't know but I'll tell you what biggest single eighth yield was that I got was in Detroit yeah the lockvar Wonka bars man 30.1% see I got 1.5 back from 1/8 I bought it at reef I can't remember who the grower was and I was too excited about what I was saying happened it was doing just like this it was just gushing and gushing gushing so I'm giving a little more now you see it started to slow down a bit right yeah okay that's let me know that you're the presser workers we're getting well yeah but we're also getting I'm looking at the the plates and seeing how close they're because I don't want to get a blowout and have to clean it up it's not a disaster if it happens it's just a pain in the ass I'd rather not right but getting this stuff off the heat is the whole goal of this press and you see how beautiful that is I mean just now it slowed down enough that I'm going to put the camera back at it stand here okay I'm gonna move this thing back up we're gonna tilt this back up now one two three lighting readjusted on to the plates so you can see that there's still lots of material here and I'm gonna finish off this press with I'm gonna finish off this press with ya right okay so now from this point we've gotten all the stuff that I think is gonna dripped a coffee or now I'm doing this by feeling already I can feel that I got pretty much most of it dripped out with the pressure I'm applying right now it's still applying gentle pressure in a slow measured way but I'm feeling the resistance of the bag now and if I go too much further risk of blow ahead especially with these dually tech bags they're not built as strong as those Knox master bags again I don't I'm not sponsored by these people I pay retail like everybody else does for my bags and I'm telling you nuts faster bags if you are doing bottle tech pressing like I do you can't get better bags you just can't they ain't giving me monster yields I'm looking for these last bubbles over here when those big ones pop I think we'll be just about know I know and the color is still amazing now uh one of the things that this will show you when it's ready to come off as that color will start to darken or it's gonna slow down production at maximum pressure right so right now I'm very very close to max on the pressure with this thing that I'm comfortable applying I always err on the side of quality over quantity and I still get blowouts sometimes I'm not I'm doing this like I do doesn't make you immune to making mistakes and that's why these videos when I have a boil out I don't hide that I don't edit it out you get to see how I fix the problem that's what a professional does right you come across a problem and you have the understanding of it to fix it adapt and overcome exactly look at that big look at that again love that this plant is giving us right now I mean look at this I'm giving it the last little bit of pressure than I'm comfortable you see how I'm having the weight of my arm to the weight of that bar it's not moving anymore so the longer it stays on the heat to lift stable it becomes it becomes more shatter like and then when you cool it off it turns into like ground glass and you can't gather it up because I just want to stick to it so yeah that's why the error on the side of caution and you get a better product the difference is what your philosophy is are you going after absolute quantity then you keep cooking it to death and you'll get a good quantity but it's gonna suck right my my rosin rosin and I produce from flour for other patients I would rather they get all of the terpenes all of the medicinal value out of this flour got their own process you know my way is not the only way to do this but I get pretty damn good results see the sugar the the it's crystallizing on the plates gentlemen you see yeah okay we're seeing diamonds being made on a press right now those are like many not many diamonds that this press has just made all natural now if I want to do a THC a mechanical separation this press can handle that too is just a long process ten stages low temperature high duration yeah and I don't have the money timer material to do that so until we start paying the kind of prices that they pay in Detroit I'm gonna have to wait okay so I think we're not done slowed down to the point where it's not producing a lot more it's starting to crystallize up I think we have gotten the best cut out of this plant that we can so let's drop the plate yeah all right I'm gonna move lighting over here get this can you get this kind of centered right here with the thing is bring this down that's right now here's what's gonna blow your mind people we're gonna get this have to die now a little sugar crystals that came up right on the edge you're over here too but there's a nice one right there you can get in line this puck is perfectly pressed look at that vikon any further it was haunted right out of that side scene yeah so I missed the view that but it didn't I brought it right to the edge which is what I wanted to do I didn't get that blow out yeah and that's what I was I was just rather err on that side I'll get them what's left on this putt now get back in the edibles so I don't lose a thing you know but oh my god no compared to what dripped off initially and we're going to compare the two before we weigh it and get a total new unit you see how that's turned a little green tinged if there is no because as ice going no no no this is because what dripped off was the best part of this the", "lbxe9wjChMA": "welcome back to the canvas packaging show episode 3 in this 12 part series also known as a saga we're talking about concentrates today quick reminder to subscribe to the channel we're going to be doing a lot of eco-friendly packaging in 2019 we're going to show you guys through the canvas packaging so so please subscribe and without further adieu unless Danis I need to add let's get right into the cannabis excuse me concentrate packaging Kalia has an announcement to make sure they've all going to show us the products first and then this was created by Heather the Saudi a favorite thing I've done for the concentrates in the entire you know for the last year Wego she calls her own packaging Fuego Johnson a good sky by the way shot up the sky shot at the skies Str jar it fits through the card Co dry it can hang it's very cost-effective it shone like the spot UV if you can can you see that on there this thing's getting a lot of compliments all right next up show it like unwrapping it on the actual show you don't have to unwrap that actually it's just it's just the bow just about yeah holding backs to put your jar in all your warnings on there it's a Massachusetts product all right keep this moving League that's the same concept just another is a flap here that you can put some branding on or a message of some sort I love that idea of how do you put a message in there that tells the story so it's like just that person holds your package and you can hit them with some kind of call to action whether it's going to your Instagram or you want to show them your tagline of what you're about so how do you tell your story through packaging is something to really think about not just a box it's a way to tell your story and it's a proven fact that I'm doing the unboxing process we talked about that a lot when you have more flaps you have more openings it's more exciting and it leads to a much lower case of buyer's remorse certainly just from having a fun experience in opening the box opening the package it's like you're opening a gift it's a true unboxing process we do a lot of the stuff in our ecommerce division and it's all about unboxing opening it up and really being pleased with what you see on the inside and half of the fun is you see on YouTube all over the place unboxing experience half of the fun is the unboxing process repeat customers that's what's gonna have people come to you again as a repeat customer versus as more dispensaries pop up down the street why would I go to you know location a versus B it's because I have that experience through their packaging and it resonates for sure alright we interrupt this program Talia please show your Christmas cookies to everyone a lot o you're interested in buying cookies for Scalia please so let's go to the chatter envelopes upgraded this has an insert in it two items from our fashion side of our business that we think could be adaptable this would be like super high but I was thinking this for shatter Irving this for a concentrate but that for shattering there's a hinge box with raw materials has an inlay and this is a flock interior which is like a by the sweater this obviously has a bracelet insert inside okay inside this box is a wood lacquer hinge box which again this was for a ring but we can make an insert for your jars really nice pause would I don't know if it shows up on camera but a gorgeous gorgeous almost like a mirror finish polished would non contempo sample don't have to be a different size but just I really like the opening and the magnetic closure and the material to the materials are a huge thing that plain to the brand overall so it's not just the design on the box with the material selection and I see a lot of people in the industry just choosing standard 18 point board with four color process for color print and the textures are great way to tell the story of what you're about where you premium will then use a premium texture are you eco-friendly are you natural then use a natural craft field so keep materials in mind this is a similar example it has a magnet in it this is the box for makeup it has a mirror inside but it has that nice snap closure type of box that you will not throw out like Dan was talking about knowing the experience and knowing what her customers going to do after he makes the purchase or she makes the purchase sometimes you want to just have a package that's going to contain and after you've thrown away other times if you really want to make it whether it's giftable or you just want to add to the experience you've designed packaging that's not going to be thrown away that's going to be kept with the life cycle of the product or even after that so an item like that with a mirror on it could be put on the desk has your brand on it forever and again the customer connects with it you know for years and years and years to come I see that was like a five milliliter concentrate jar would look really nice than that that that concept okay what do you anyone say about this all right so this is just sort of a aspirational or concept that we haven't really tested but we're thinking a concept issue to have shatter inside of there I want to see if you guys think that would be viable this is the concept that we did for the fashion industry we had a floating ring box and I think a lot of people like to see shatter they like to see how clear it is right how transparent it is I'm thinking that could be a really really cool option to display these Nick what do you think that was actually your idea about the your set you're telling me about like the transparent nature like to see you know the purity of it how transparent is honestly I think that's a great idea I think that would be really unique and different okay I guess this episode is over because our helpers just run out the door and she's back alright anyone have anything else to add in the concentrates you guys things you're seeing in the market that would be worth sharing with the audience or do we kind of hit everything and everything about the boxes we have a customer that were conceptualising packaging for now that wants to make sure that whoever is using her packaging moving forward can fit it in their pocket or if you're using it for a pre-roll or concentrate that they can take one of the tubular ones and actually turn it into carry your joint to a concert or going somewhere else where they are just having it a nice box to fits easily in their pocket like chapstick with so I think that that's really important for people to try and not keep in mind too when they're designing their packaging is the smaller the better and you know people can use it more than once that's really going to be the best-case scenario mm-hmm oh great I think especially with the primary packaging so like I think a lot of this stuff people could have a box they're gonna keep that primary package on then like fit it in their pocket I think that you hear that a lot that's definitely a common thing what is it going to be like for the person who's carrying the product how do you have that seamlessly integrated to their lives the cookie was great and a little rude eating on camera I could see someone writing the comments this guy's eating on camera but I'm sorry to you whoever's gonna call me out on that", "KVFRkBbZ9-E": "everybody how you doing I stopped at the healing center today and picked up some grass roots they got a big drop across roots today and I'm rehydrating a bunch of it now so Cinderella I've got half an ounce of that rehydrating but I've got some East Coast Sour Diesel that's ready to press so please join me as we come over here and show you what we're working with here we got East Coast Sour Diesel bring it in at twenty seven point five one nine percent THC there's a really good look at it real decent okay it's been rehydrated with Hydra stones for two and a half hours and it's already ready to go so bear with me here's I move my camera to where you can kind of see everything that's going on okay and then I'll yup Lister when we get ready to press so here here it is CRD mighty prototype press at 200 degrees triple point 20-ton we've got our 8120 micron dug finish and Randy bag inverted ready to give bottom textile impressive casements I'll move this bag up almost set up as a slug here if everybody is doing well during the virus thing here hope everybody staying safe and medicated at home social distancing isn't but at the same time Nina gets medicine so go to the healing center they are keeping everybody at social distance away from each other it's nice and safe but there this morning everybody was nice and orderly it worked out really well just so happened that that drop can get I was the second one in the door today at the Union Center Monroeville so that was pretty cool [Music] these videos today medicine so we pressed into our slug yeah it is cut off the excess and we already have our paper set up you know set this here move the camera in so we get you good view get ready to happen get this sit up here so you get a good view press there we go right there take take our slug and into our press and this paper out of the way as best as possible so you can see what's going on it's more white on the subject here we go you can see what's going on a lot better let's get this centered up Oh the shot closer a little more height on here all right there we go I should look just great [Music] let's make some medicine shall we [Music] they need the pressure hope everybody's fighting themselves enough medication to get through this crisis and please be careful when you shop if you were if you did resort to the black market I just need to warn you a lot of people out there our sum of hot have as Street and it ain't real just let you know so that you don't get burned there are some bad people out there who do not care but you are what your needs are trust me dealt with a lot of with this cannabis space in recent times [Music] okay and should not change clearly long for the start [Music] it's like that here just enough [Music] [Music] I suppose good as this views gonna get more pressure here and it's gonna start extracting real quick [Music] and you can see it in there it's already starting in a little closer [Music] you see it there it is look at that a beautiful a beautiful medicine right there more pressure look at that material move it just wants to come out of that plant [Music] just wants to come out once to medication make your life better I love this plant enough everything that it was to do with this planet but especially precedent that's okay we are approaching the quarterbacks pressure still know the material [Music] get a blowout have an issue here always err on the side of quality over quantity you're not interested in the quality [Music] really not trying to make medicine [Music] almost done good on pressure give us a little bit more time when I stopped seeing any movement see what we got spreading out quite nicely across the face in the plates cuz you're still and rate where it means to me [Music] I think we are about ready look [Music] look at that that beautiful hmm it's like you've got some sand off of this one crystallization all right [Music] right on here let's get the camera we focused what's going on okay so let's see it all right here we go [Music] look at that perfect no contamination of the raw it's exactly what you want to see the smell coming off this is incredible that color got crystals sand [Music] we're just a channel list of a cool now we're gonna gather it up where my trust tool here here we go [Music] look at how nice this is coming up notice the color if you're dealing with hemp you're dealing with hot hemp street that you think as weed doesn't come out looking like this smelling this good you got you got some funk we prefer and I know that with the prices the way they are and I know a lot of people going to the street I'm telling you don't get painted okay be careful I would still recommend going to the dispensary if you want to get results like this on a regular basis the camera here move it around I'll get you focus on there [Music] look at that so let's find out what our yield is showing it's a support let's get you over here get this free centered up right there okay that would be let's find out what our yield is it seems like if I my superiors thought I had put them right here on the table but you know every good so can you see the hello let's get it in here a little bit easier for me to see no I want everybody see what we got here to get this

dispensary haul here in Florida I just ran out of weed and concentrates and I need to re-up so let's see what we can get today I have a coupon for my first time visit and move and we're gonna see what I can get with the 25% off but first let's go get some cash I gotta run into the 7-eleven here and use their ATM because don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more dispensary hauls and for a sneak preview of my hauls check out my instagram at instagram.com slash Cubans 4:20 and there will be links in the description for my other social media [Music] we're outside a move it looks like this one's right next to a doctor's office well we're gonna head into the dispensary here and see we can get as far as flower and concentrate goes I called them earlier they said they had some good stuff but uh we're gonna verify and make sure let's go check it out all right we are just leaving move now I absolutely [ __ ] up that 25% off coupon I got a lot of [ __ ] so let's go check this out and see what we got but I think I need a snack first but first do you follow your boy on twitch it switch that TV slash Cubans check me out we get that boy yo tropical you know about those chicken sandwiches by talking about the popeyes chicken sandwich out here we got that boy out tropical sandwich hmm oh my god so good all right let's take a closer look at the haul we got today picked up some cards today I got a Maui wowie and an OMG push cart and these are both half gram card sleeves that regular 510 C cell card I should have some batteries that go with these I got a gram of some rosin and this is a strain called guru and it's some dry sift rosin the blood tender was recommending this strain and it looks really nice I didn't get to smell the concentrates in there which isn't always an option but this was actually about the same price as the most recent gram of rasa and I got in Colorado so not too far off on price there which is interesting for me and I picked up an eighth of some lemon Margie here we got some nice flour here this was one of the better options in there they did have a few but this one looked like it had the densest in the frost yes bud so I went with that and I really liked the smell on this one it's really good stuff and then I also grabbed the grandmas of shatter here I picked up a gram of candy Margie and this is some move shatter it's an ethanol extraction and this is like really good looking stuff I haven't seen too many ethanol extracted shatters but this [ __ ] looks really good well I can't wait to dump these let's see what they taste like alright it's time to try out what we picked up here I'm gonna do some cold start dabs off this Cactus Jack rig I got this from hem Perko and you can actually get 5% off the whole hem Perko website with the Cubans code I'll put a link below but we're gonna do some cold starts with this guy here I'm gonna use this skill tools dabber here this is the skill tools flexing and I'm honestly used to hundreds of bad tools in my life and this is the best one it's got like a very precise flat tip that kind of curves so you can you can get just the right break or just the right scoop on any concentrate I'll put a link to this because this is honestly I've gone through hundreds and this is the best job til everyone should that one they're like 10 bucks let's break off some of the shatter we're gonna load it up in the nail for a cold start really good shatter consistency all right let's see if I can load this up in here yeah just Lakes off let go so we got our shatter in there we got our turk pearl stuck in there let's rip this bad boy [Music] [Music] I actually want to hit another dab of that shatters so let's get a big scoop on their car else let's [ __ ] this one up oh there we go dang oh that's it going [Music] Jesus and they fit [Music] the shadow tastes good but this will ring really [ __ ] rinse let's scoop some of this rosin I want to do another nice cold start of that now I mentioned this was about the same price as the last grammar Oz and I got in Colorado but I actually got I think new 25% off now I think about it's always cheaper never mind never mind I'm okay we got that the rosin scooped in here bad of excited to try this one only [ __ ] yeah yeah that one's much better [Music] the flavor on that one versus a shatter is crazy [Music] hmm well that hits really nice alright let's break into these nugs here I got to see if this lemon Margie is any good smells so good we add a nice bold pack there that looks like a nice one alright let's take a rip of this lemon Margie [Music] [Music] [Music] did you see that ghost what the [ __ ] all right don't ghost your heads I'm just [ __ ] around [ __ ] that was good it went down so smooth that I was like [ __ ] it ghost it it wasn't harsh it wasn't fighting its way out I was like and then in my head I was like yeah I guess it hit him and let's see what we can do here [Music] yeah the two concentrates that I got from move are like super good I'm really stoked on him gone I got a deal on them too yeah I'm really stoked on move everything I got from there was really good the flour that concentrates everything is really good stuff they had other stuff there that I wanted to go back and get it just the way I was over when I'm going on when it's currently like the flour had a really nice taste to

OSHA Rob Bailey with me today we've got Eric Polaski the director of marketing at a company called pure pressure we also have been Britton that am i pronouncing your last name correctly yep that's correct then the lead engineer and one of the founders at pure pressure as well so how are you guys doing today doing great we're excited to be here yeah we're yeah present it's AG time okay hi I'm kind of excited about this because I know a little bit about rows and extraction but there's a lot I'd like to know and so I thought we'd start at high level and then just kind of work our way into it and learn a little bit out your business model and what you guys are doing so why don't we start there can we start with just the basics of the process in rasen extraction what exactly is it at a high level yeah so Robin is a really interesting new way of extraction that's become popular over the past couple years and its really accelerating the main reason Rasen is picking up steam and what it is that it's an extraction method that uses no solvents so simply put rosin is the cannabis oil and concentrate that's created when you apply heat and pressure to cannabis product which essentially liquefies and extrudes the trichomes and cannabinoids have the material that you're pressing so you know really it is the most simple extraction method and since there's no solvents involved it's also extremely safe it's something that people can do at home small medium you know boutique businesses have really taken rosin and ran with it you know it's really something that's new and a lot of people are really really interested in Robin because it's a little bit more health friendly you know there's no butane there's no propane it's really one of the purest and most authentic expressions the cannabis plant you know in a concentrated form fascinating so getting into it a little bit what constitutes the perfect extraction when you're when you're trying to do this for rosin what are some of the basics that are involved on doing this yeah so essentially what we're doing is we're using heat to lower the viscosity of the oils within the plant and then we're putting that material inside a filtration bag and then so once those oils are liquefied they're under pressure you know in our case from an air cylinder pressing these two plates together and those liquid oils get forced out of the filtration bag so um you know essentially go ahead no I'm probably saying I got you I hear you oh sorry I thought you say nevermind so once those oils lower viscosity there they become mobile and essentially what we're trying to do is force these oils out of the filtration bag and what's left is you've got useless plant matter inside your filtration bag and then you've got nice high-quality rosin on your parchment paper right outside the filtration bag so as far as you know what's important when you're when you're pressing material well you can press any kind of material you can press flour keys bubble hash sometimes trim although we don't always recommend pressing trim directly we usually recommend to keep that out before you you press it essentially you want well cured fresh material is going to get you the highest quality rosin it's going to improve clarity the terpene content will be the highest in that case and so we like to press nice fresh well cared flour and with a relative humidity around 60% and what that does is when we're when we're liquefying these oils we don't want the plant man to act as a sponge and to soak these oils up so having your flower at a 60% humidity is essentially saturating the flower with moisture so that when those oils liquefy they're hydrophobic and they're they're kind of finding their way out of the bag without being absorbed by the plant material so that's a very important step for pressing flower and then when it comes to Keef and bubble hash the humidity content isn't nearly as important but having good high-quality fresh material is really key and then being able to have really good control over pressure ramping over time you know these are very sensitive materials high oil content and that's where our press accelerates is being able to to start at a low pressure a ramp your way up to a higher pressure and get a full yield without really without sacrificing quality okay you know what I've read about it the process that a word that keeps coming up or a metric is is temperature and the ability control it why why is that so important so temperature is important because as I said we are lowering the viscosity of the oil with heat so the temperature that we press that is going to also directly correlate to the the consistency the texture of the rosin on the output side so if we press with a low temperature we can tend to get a buttery consistency if we increase that so a low temperature would be around you know 140 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and then on the high end we would get up at 220 degrees 230 degrees Fahrenheit and that will get you usually a more Shatter consistency and there's you know this is all based on your starting material so you can have you can have certain flour that's going to change the color and the consistency and same with bubble and keys but in general you can kind of have that butter consistency with lower temperatures and a shattered consistency with higher temperatures what's really important is that you're able to have a good temperature distribution across the entire surface of the heat plate a lot of these low quality presses are going to have a very poor temperature distribution we've measured up to a 90 degree fahrenheit difference across the surface of a plate on a competitor's model and what that means is that you might have an area that's not hot enough to even liquefy the oil so you've got no no rosin coming out of that section of the bag and then you might be burning your material on the other end of the bag so having a really even temperature distribution across your plates is really the only way to have a repeatable consistent process with a high-quality output okay when you mention bags is that far the reason why you guys you use micron bags as part of the extraction process yeah yeah so we used a polyester monofilament mesh that's handmade here in Colorado and we sell for different microns 36 70 to 90 and 115 micron and what that is is just the size of the particle that will let through we use polyester monofilament and there's a lot of all in the industry that use stainless steel or nylon nylon is going to be the the biggest problem that want that material has a really high stretch sometimes up to two three hundred percent stretch where polyester is less than one percent and so when you have a high stretch material on a filtration bag what that means is that your micron rating completely goes out the window because under pressure those openings just stretch stainless-steel bags tend to be woven with a thicker thread they're durable and some people will try to reuse them we find it to be more of a pain than it's worth to reuse a stainless keg and because it was thicker threads you tend to lose more oil in the bag itself because the thickness of the met traps oil in that mesh so polyester for us was a no-brainer it's lower cost than stainless steel it's got the strength and it gets a high yield result without changing your your micron mesh size yeah like other spaces is strain and quality of plant that you will pretty imperative in this process yeah Eric here so this is something that we really preach and you know tell our customers and anyone interested in rosin is that you know quality and quality out it's a very cliche way to put it but that's absolutely where you know Robin fits into the equation for any extraction company or anyone who's interested in doing concentrates rosin tends to be an artisanal great product you know not only are there no solvents but because you're putting it in that mesh bag no micron size however small unless you get you know so small that you won't even use that type of measure it's unbelievably expensive it's not going to filter out any contaminants or any issues like that so what you put in truly is what you get out you can't just blast away powder mildew mold things of that nature so when it comes down to quality we're not just talking about plants that are very resinous like your gorilla glues and your high trichome producing strains we're also talking about you know organic high terpene content cannabis that's going to come out the other end as good or better than the way that it went in so when it comes to quality it's really everything when it comes to rosin and that's why Robin tends to sell for a higher price per gram and the unit cell for more than their equivalent solvent-based competitions because people know that they're getting that really high quality pure product when they're you know consuming rosin gotcha you know it's quite a craft what you guys are doing I mean there's obviously a lot of chemistry but it's a ton of know-how and I'm curious how did you guys get here today was it a lot of it just experienced a trial and error can you speak a little bit about that yeah so this has been my business partner Josh was actually been in the cannabis industry for quite a while I have a machine design background I'm a mechanical engineer and we grew up together so we've been friends forever and he came to me with the problem you know he had a couple rosin presses but he had purchased that just weren't holding up and really weren't getting him the yield that he needed so he came to me and we we built a machine just for the hell of it and we ended up getting six times they yield on our first prototype than we did on either of the machines that he had we thought we were onto something here and we made the next version or iteration of it and it only got better and we started really just taking material from his grow to to start playing with different variables and really dial in what's important here as far as pressure temperature you know size and design of the bag size and design of the plates and we just played with each variable and took a real mind-numbing amount of data and just put it all together and decided do you know this is this is where it makes sense this is how we do it and from there it's it started out seeing seeming very ambiguous and kind of like you said a craft and almost an art and as time goes on and we're learning more and more it's becoming more of a science and we're we're finding very repeatable results with what we do that's great and that's a nice segue into my follow-up question because you guys are known as a pretty unique player in this space and I'm curious what what is unique what is different about you guys standing out from the rest of the competition what why do you get how are you guys able to develop this this reputation in this market yeah great question Eric here there's there's a couple ways that we've built the reputation that we have I think the first one is that you know simply we just have amazing engineering resources at our disposal you know between Ben and our industrial designer who came on Kyle within the past year you know we're really focused on putting out the best products we possibly can I mean making the best rosin press and the best accessories is our number one priority we really want people to have the experience with rosin that they never thought was possible with some of our competitors products so that's the first big thing the other thing is that you know as far as a small industry goes a lot of rosin press companies currently and previously were you know to put it mildly not known for their customer service and you know we have a professional team that understands that customer service is really everything when it comes to making sure that people are happy with their purchase decisions so we've really built a reputation more than anything on providing you know the best rosin presses and accessories out there but also you know we really go out of our way to help our customers it's a small industry and if somebody's not happy word can spread very quickly so we really wanted to keep our reputation as good as it could possibly be within the community and you know after you take enough late night calls and weekend support emails we'll really start to understand that we're serious about what we do and we're serious about their success so you know we are rather nerds it's all we're focused on and we really care about our customers so you know I think that's what really sets us apart more than anything yeah I just echo that with other other companies that we interview and successful businesses that kind of transcends all of them is the ability to be authentic and take more of a partnering nature as opposed to just building a product and shipping off and say there you go so kind of neat to see and I'm curious some peer pressure where what are some of the things to look forward to on the horizon what what is some things you guys are aiming for in the future for the company yeah also a great question I can't give you all the details but early next year we're going to be coming out with an at home level press so currently our two flagship products the Pikes Peak Robin press which is where we really staked our name and then we just released the long speak which is a larger more commercially oriented cousin of the Pikes Peak it's got about 60% more pressure so we're really working on that we actually also just released our press where technology which is a full LCD touchscreen but it's one that we developed in-house we didn't just go out and buy a touchscreen and plug it in it allows you to save recipes and really dial in your process and get repeatable results in a way that no other presses on the market can match and then looking forward into the future you know we're really focused on coming out with an equivalent quality at-home press that's geared towards enthusiasts and small growers and people who want to make Rasen at home but don't want to settle for a cheaper rather than press and are still looking for a high quality product like ours but you know maybe they don't have the funds or the need for a six or seven thousand dollar Robin press like our other are additionally we're also really focused on helping extraction labs get the most out of their equipment by offering full you know lab in a box type kits we already do bubble hash kits sifting you know accessory products but we're really trying to tie that all together so that people can come to us and they can say hey I want to get into rods and what do I need to do and we say here's your turnkey solution we've got everything for you and you know a lot of education would be the thing I would conclude with on our future plans we really work hard to bring a lot of Education and information to an industry that lacks it and that most of the information people gather is on Facebook groups and these random posts and you know it's not a very good way to disseminate information when people are just having conversations here and there so a lot of media efforts are underway to put out as much information as we can you know of course for free just to educate the community and really move the entire industry forward not just selling our products but you know making rasen everything that it could and should be you know as an industry sure what's the biggest misnomer in in rosin extraction what is what is the thing and obstacle you're constantly having to educate folks on if there is one yeah no there there's a couple I'd say the number one thing and we're on the verge of coming out with the pretty in-depth blog post on this is pressure and perhaps heat plate sides because it's what you have many of our competitors presses have very high tonnage our Pikes Peak for example is a five ton press and many of our competitors are 15 20 tons and a lot of people just aren't really sure so they come to us and they say hey why is your press twice as expensive as this other one but it only has a quarter of the pressure tonnage and we have to explain to them that you know in many instances a higher pressure hydraulic cylinder is a much cheaper and less reliable way to apply pressure to your rods and extraction process then the cylinders that we use which are oilless maintenance-free and they're pneumatic which is the key thing they're custom fabricated for us in the US so you know a lot of people think that they need high pressure to get good results which we you know strongly believe simply isn't true and then furthermore heat plate size we get a lot of questions about people saying you know hey I got a a giant heat plate it's the size of a plate what can I do with this but you really need to be conscious of the size and shape especially of your heat plates and we've done a ton of research and information into figuring out pretty much what the optimal size is though more than anything those are the two things people get confused about you know to sum that up that one you don't need nearly as much pressure as a lot of our competitors are saying you do they're just using high pressure hydraulic cylinders because that's the cheap and easy way to create a press and then furthermore you definitely do not need giant square plates because that reduces your yields in many ways it means that the oil has to travel so far from the center of the bag to the perimeter and actually be pushed out that you're wasting a lot of oil that's either getting stuck in the bag it's sitting on the heat for too long and degrading the terpene profile so you know a long narrow heat plate shape is always going to be your best bet those are probably the two questions that we get the most and have to talk through sure I know what makes sense and I'm curious that you guys you've got you've carved out a really niche space a space that you guys are clearly leading in and I'm curious when you guys as this space unfolds what are the challenges and being scalable you know I mean as we know with legislation in the cannabis industry it's quite fluid there are a lot of obstacles what are some of the things that you guys would struggle with as you continue to grow your business successfully yeah scalability is one that we get a lot because rosin as it is is not an extraction method that scales as well as some of the solvent based methods and we've kind of accepted the fact that as time goes on we're working really hard to automate and produce a lot of innovations that make this process a lot less labor-intensive than it is now so we're working in that direction but you know I think rosin is always going to be kind of a small batch type product and for a lot of people that holds cachet you know this isn't your 20,000 bait cartridges a month you know a week produced on a co2 on sheen with you know God knows what material it could be literally anything and now you've just got you know raw oil you know a lot of the other extraction methods you know to put it in a funny way someone told us that you know it's kind of like distillate and co2 is like the hot dogs of concentrates you have really no idea what's in there you know rosin is is pretty much going to be a small batch thing you do have to increase your labor to upscale your size but there's also a ways to increase efficiency like pressing bubble hash or key for sift you can do you know two to three times more in a single press than you can if you're pressing flowers so some of the some of the time harder players out there really pressing a lot of bubble hash and that's you know perhaps the zenith of all concentrates right now you know bubble hash rods and made with fresh frozen materials so there's a little bit of a tangent but you know as far as scalability goes that's what we're really looking to attack in the future that makes a lot of sense well guys this has been a fantastic interview I really appreciate you taking the time could you direct our viewers or listeners if they wanted to dig up more information on peer pressure and and your products where would they go yeah absolutely we are super approachable

two oil and then we have a ten to one flower that's called XXX and it makes a four to one oil so THC is a little bit more soluble in the butane and propane than their sorry THC is more soluble in it or something or maybe the CBD possibly gets ripped out in the [ __ ] d waxing process who knows but uh no actually because on those runs i don't be waxing to win rise which could pull it out there who [ __ ] knows THC and CBD the molecules are made up of the exact same atoms I believe it's just a different isomer correct me if I'm wrong scientists if I have any watching this but yeah here's some CBD [ __ ] that we got some sharp shock down there more CBD crew [ __ ] and that makes a one two for that shark shock ratio we have so that would be like let's say 80 percent THC twenty percent all right sorry Adi adverse at KFC 20 percent CBD so it's not really mentionable but it does have enough CBD in there to change the effect versus our diesel so yeah that's those so yeah our our four two ones come in ten milligram the ten milligram ones have less than I think it's like two point four two point three milligrams THC and ten milligram CBD the twenty fives have I think six milligrams of THC and twenty-five milligrams of CBD and then the 50s have like 12 milligrams of THC and fifty milligrams of CBD and then of course our three two twos it's like it's 17 milligrams THC twenty-five milligrams CBD we don't make these ones in ten milligram and then the 50s are 35 milligrams CBD or THC sorry 35 milligrams THC and 50 milligrams CBD and init sometimes we even go even further and make a hundred one hundred milligram CBD pill takes a lot of [ __ ] oil that is a lot more valuable in smaller doses because not everyone is trying to get wrecked on CBD oil but some do have high tolerances but for them they could just take 257 so today not really extracting or doing really anything I figured to kind of make it interesting I would show you how I finished the slab kind of like I did in yesterday's video where I had the what wasn't yesterday's video but it was numbers episode three which was on the 21st I think today's a twenty well no that was the 22nd that we did that video I can't find remember I said the dates in the video and you guys see one day they were uploaded so that's the day I might as well grab this [ __ ] in my backpack because I bring it home you should have a [ __ ] another I are done in another heat gun at home that be practical right also our pills we're going to start putting them in these little crack cocaine baggies or whatever versus the mylar ones that we put our oil and sorry about this pump one sec let me go ahead oh my god he must be on the moon or no vice versa he must have a million dollar pump if you follow my Instagram you hear me talk about that [ __ ] with different altitudes and all that how it it's no different as far as what's in there it's the pressure on the outside of the gauge that gives you these faulty readings like that like let's say I was in Denver Colorado no different in there with the same 8 CFM Robin air pump but my needle will probably be right here but it beat the same low pressure out there or in there it's just that work five inches of mercury lower because we're [ __ ] however high your altitude is mile high whatever the [ __ ] that is 4,000 feet or some [ __ ] but yeah people think you can't pull this deep of a vac in Denver as you can down here at sea level just because that needle doesn't go as far people are funny but yeah and just also the the barometric pressure outside today it's higher so that's why that's lower if it was raining like a [ __ ] that [ __ ] would be a little bit closer to 30 and there would still be the same it just has to do with the pressure on the outside of the gauge so no this chamber isn't pulled any [ __ ] deeper than yours if you have this pump I mean different pumps can pull the different capacities but no this isn't at some crazy message mysterious [ __ ] negative 31 HD that's not possible this deeper than absolute vacuum so even even your [ __ ] million dollar NASA pumping so oh I didn't even tell you what I was doing so I'm gonna go ahead and start deflating this so it can that can happen while I'm well I'm telling you what I'm doing here and I can show you what them bubbles do because it's slabs on a higher rap and doesn't have one above it you see them and they don't leave a [ __ ] bubble in them versus if you let that [ __ ] out real quick that's just something I learned maybe this is different for you if it is I mean like if you're doing something that works and you see me stay and do something different don't just do something different if what you're doing works and keep [ __ ] doing it that makes sense right so yeah if it works whatever you're doing works keep doing it then you'll need to change something that's not broken I'm not telling anyone to do that this is Rico who are having issues and answers so uh now what I do I used to cut the same squares of parchment for grams and 1/2 grams but now we do larger squares for the grams than we do for the half grams but they all still go in the same white mylar bags but they're labeled gram or 1/2 gram or whatever you understand so the first thing I have to do since the cutter my dad got me is it wide enough to fit all the parchment the roll why so you have to fold it hot dog style like that remember hot dog and hamburger from kindergarten like that the next step which is that take these [ __ ] and this is just what I do it I'm sure you've been doing it for the longest time I was using the acrylic containers because any time my package is parchment which I'll tell you my mistake on that in a minute but anytime attackers your parchment put in the mylar bags I would do let's say the grams that way and then I quit the half grams and acrylic containers not directly on the acrylic I would use my my little 1 inch circle and heed and hole puncher and I'd punched me a little circle of parchment out to put the oil on in there so it wouldn't be stuck in there but my personal well I put in parchment the way I do it package now the parchment I was using back then was the foil back to parchment so you couldn't really see through it versus now I use this [ __ ] so when I package and I put it in a little container like I'll probably show you that I'll put it in the mylar baggie you can actually still see the color of the oil through it and someone I mentioned that on Instagram so see how it's foil on the back and I would use this also to put this [ __ ] in the bag so you still just see foil you wouldn't see that well so someone come in to buy six grams wouldn't buy six single grams and that they would buy [ __ ] twelve half grams in the acrylic ones because they could see what they were getting so now packaged different in it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier which I used to say I don't need to do the cheap way but whatever [ __ ] I'm doing the cheap way so now what you do with these this is 15 inches wide I know because I measured it so you go like this you have my fifth [ __ ] assistant now and I'm still [ __ ] packaging because they have other jobs too and I'll explain why cuz I'm sure twenty or thirty minute twenty thirty comments oh but you're existent I'll be your assistant I'll explain why I'm when we're out there smoking why you guys gave me my assistant because I make videos I need someone to come help me I'm sure I get fifty people going sure I live in the same state I'm gonna come help you but then you would get paid but the thing is we don't trust you not just me even if I trust you let's say I try to do with my life um I have bosses that have to trust you too and in case you didn't notice anytime a room comes down there's anywhere from a 6000 watt room or a 4000 watt room or 12 thousand watt room worth herb drying which you would be around so in you be around all the oil and all the equipment and starting material starting material so you guys would need a lot of trust so it's not necessarily what you can do and I'm here I am telling you now before we're smoking but it's it's a trust issue so it's it's mainly not how good you are at packaging or how good you are helping me make oil so far I haven't had anyone I mean I'm training they do now they let me make well cause he's a [ __ ] he's got a PhD in microbiology so that really really helps he knows all the [ __ ] smart [ __ ] but the mechanics is actually doing the extraction that's what I he has to learn so back to what I was saying for as far as someone coming in here to do this for me I'm not always gonna be here there's not going to always be someone here babysitting you yes you're on camera but who cares if we got you on camera if you went to [ __ ] Florida with the weed you know what I'm saying so that's the issue with that so pretty much I stick to only people who already employed or I want to employ because it's a what do you call it volunteer situation as far as collective gardens go but I can only work her well how many people do it because just because we already trust him to [ __ ] work in the shop then obviously then we trust him to be out here doing this so now I'm going to five so I didn't mention what I did there but I went to uh I started off with the end of it at the 10 inch mark and I had said left me with five overhanging because remember 15 inches so then after that I went ahead in a cut it and I moved over to can't assume these are backwards I've moved it over to UM [ __ ] I'm so sidetracked and I'm trying to get these papers right so damn it okay so effective missing so I started with it the end of the thing at the tin mark right there sliced off five inches and moved it to five sliced off five more inches and now I have three five inch by five well I guess I underestimated so they're probably five by four and a half and then I'll go yes this is H H mixing wondering you know I need you is get like some of them [ __ ] shave you [ __ ] by me wanting them x-ray table so I can lay my dark ass [ __ ] [ __ ] that should have been food-grade but I needed to make him to shatter because I'm gonna peasant one of those slabs and go and throw that [ __ ] on it on an x-ray [ __ ] table so I can make it look all gold and then be like yeah it's at this shot so all the patients can go there and get [ __ ] disappointed when they find out that it's as black as the [ __ ] they took this morning oh I don't know if that would be healthy so I just fold it in half and now I felt like this and I have all of them I think there's a 15 of them here and so I doing like that right so now they're folded and then you can set them up with my grandma's on the left side and that's just a quick demonstration yes I still use the cheap [ __ ] I don't even know how cheap the scale is you guys would probably tell me but yes I still use I have one at home and I one here and next door they got the nice scale this is what I weigh the weed on it's one of them balanced e ones where's my tear Toph right here boom so just more [ __ ] drying got a frog in my throat this morning guys so yeah that's the half gram size ones it's a gram size one and then I just kind of sit here chipping away now that it's deflated I can go ahead and show you what we're gonna do it is [ __ ] weird to lock oh well just let someone get hurt [ __ ] one arm sucks with the powder-free was there was a nursing assistant we had the powdered gloves and going from a [ __ ] musky ass hand that was just in a glove into a powder glove you don't really have that issue but doing it with these which always use powder free she loves Hannah weed or oil or anything like that because you want to smoke that talk oh speaking of toffee powder I bought a pocket [ __ ] and it came with talking powder put on it and then it keeps the the material feeling more [ __ ] like I guess I don't know but I never used that [ __ ] cuz afraid of getting my peel and burned I don't know if that's exactly appropriate for YouTube I mean Here I am with [ __ ] weed but I'm sure they'll blend but can give me in trouble for talking about [ __ ] pocket [ __ ] so here's the slab on the parchment dah-dah-dah still not looking as pretty as it is and remember those bubbles keep in mind these indentations from where they were because those are gonna open up after we flip it and hit with heat gun and if I flip it and let's say let's just say this was because it's been purging for 48 hours there no sorry 46 hours so let's just pretend that it's only been purging for 12 hours if I flipped it over right now put it back in the oven it would do the exact same thing and it's going to do when I go ahead and hit with the seat gun only I'm not trying to go in there and [ __ ] pull out even more turps after I'm done purging it as you guys saw my mistake last time I didn't have my [ __ ] cut already twenty-fifths I think please it yesterday was his 24th DJ's 20 I delete this is my only black curling shirt I've got four or five green ones I've got at least three blue ones and I got two red ones so pretty much half of my [ __ ] t-shirts or these shirts and then a lot of my other t-shirts are of that real-deal extract [ __ ] when we have those shirts made and then the [ __ ] and ex-partner goes around running around still calling it using my [ __ ] name and my [ __ ] logo so I decided it [ __ ] it I make one for her well healing just call this [ __ ] was going [ __ ] ain't gonna steal that name so yeah so that's why I don't wear the real good x-ray shirts no more unless I'm at home and I just feel like wearing a shirt around the house damn it I [ __ ] up herbal evening shirts too from using them in life like doing extractions to keep at the bottom of a pool of dry ice and they get all ripped up and [ __ ] up I should be using that really likes track shirts for that so remember just like last video before the flip I always do this and you don't have to do one side than the other you could do one side and then a third of it and then the other third of it yeah that works too or you could even do like I get in the last video where you do it over something hell someone's probably going to make some [ __ ] pyramid thing like this to do it over whatever you're going to drop it on the floor whatever you're scared which I've done this with hundreds of slab to still have a droplet on the floor so I mean I've dropped slab but not from that and it sucks from dropping slabs because the only thing you really do from there is dissolved in alcohol and winterize it and then now you've got some winter ice [ __ ] any others does but it was on the floor okay one on the floor isn't gonna die in that alcohol that you're scared of at least and if it's any particulate [ __ ] it's getting filtered out Oh someone's calling me decline so I like about this phone it doesn't ruin my whole video when I need a phone well I do hate like if I'm filming a skate trick or something like that like it was yesterday and someone text messages me and he goes okey-dokey now time for the damn heat gun which I have to remember to turn that [ __ ] down because is using it for decarboxylated in combination with a griddle but I like the heat from the top in the bottom to not waste time and this thing happens to fit perfect in a lab stand like this so you can have it blasting down onto your top of yours in okay so here's what we'll do we'll start right here at the front of your screen where you can see the best maybe we'll turn the light on somebody getting in the regular way I'm out 133 yeah that's fine and I just tested it on the table loaded on the table with I argon to see how it was gonna do I mean if I can put my hand on it then it's not too hot dude this smells real good this is the royal camp and this is actually from the stuff that I made the dry cept with I put all my B grade rice if back in the tube the first run a royal Kim that I did and I still have more to run but the first one that I did was with just straight I'll show ya any second I'll show you after this slab to that whole thing and all this is doing is speeding up what would happen if he tossed it back in the oven and didn't pull it back they just let it sit there for 30 minutes since I'm not trying to wait 30 minutes well it sits in there and then I can forget and come back two hours later and it makes it one CH of [ __ ] turd bubbles what you mean is other volatile [ __ ] that got extracted with the volatile non porous all of it and there's nothing volatile in there other than [ __ ] butane just blue so 16 year old kids mine wait these see this selfie shot you dis [ __ ] I'll do up d1 in the video and I might even post one on Instagram because for some reason though he's tend to get the most [ __ ] lights not that I'm fishing for likes but I mean that just means people enjoy the picture which that's why I'm here to put up [ __ ] people enjoy so now it doesn't look like it did and quickly well it's not completely cool back off I do have to uh to do this with it okay make sure don't have that bond with the parchment because when you do heat up one side it does heat up all the way through yes I just lost the dabs work boohoo sure some tears of a shed you want it to be able to not be sticking so now here's what made the first batch row Kim what I do if you watch the great gardener video where him and him in a bubble man took the bard with the seeded barb and they held it they did one of these numbers they would hold the branch like this and they go so I do that over another tub and then after I've pulled all the branches up I go and run it so that's how that works so now let's go get another pair of gloves it's like you know what [ __ ] it the ones that I originally was using a minute ago go ahead because I didn't touch that nasty wood thing [ __ ] it I'm touching my slab let me get a real pair of gloves not like I'm not gonna be [ __ ] package when I'm packaging or what someone else is packaging that is a glove funeral day you haven't even got to the point where we smoke and it's [ __ ] almost 30 minutes in hope no one's upset say do you know people like to watch the dabs [ __ ] maybe I'll take my little uh slab selfie I'll take the screenshot from this video to use so now that I got this on the next step is to put the hat on backwards so the bell of the Hat doesn't stick to the slab in then third step the fools then I think this makes a difference you put on your lab coat even though this wasn't on for earlier parts of this process you put it on for the picture and people like it don't you know my [ __ ] or not already now this is where it's weird because normally I used the front-facing camera to do this so I don't know if I'm gonna be in the shot so I guess I gotta set my [ __ ] up so usually I'm right here my slabs right there this should work so then I go at my camera on 5 second timer I push ding I got five seconds to and I hold it and then I hear good click and I go like this we get that out for whether it'll stick on it and then I'm already getting hot so I quickly have to go and take off this book in lab coat which makes the whole difference in your process you were on one of these oh my god this [ __ ] PP ends go down tariffs coke [ __ ] prices go up only good things come from wearing a [ __ ] backup plus prejudice people think you're smarter so I think oh one more thing to do get high let's smoke the [ __ ] that we just [ __ ] finished this part looks like it wants to come off keep stuff verse not keep stuff can tell a difference and when I say Keith I don't mean [ __ ] keep the [ __ ] out of it I mean pulling a total of counting the B grade pulling about 35 grams off of 600 grams is over pound and then only taking out of that 35 grams only getting like less than 10 fullmetal then taking that stuff that wasn't full amount putting it back in the tube with the weed I mean it's not like I run this train over and over to know the difference in yield but it [ __ ] stinks damn cop coffee filters make it too good Deborah why am I wearing gloves one gabbing okay I gave a little bit of oil to a friend who just like smokes whether they're blunt smoker and they just got a lead pipe they don't have any way to dab anything like that so I gave them some oil and said the clear on top you got that beer weed I get text messages last night it's making my weed light on fire like yeah let that [ __ ] melt into the bud first then you just get like 30 more extra hits off the bud than you normally would have he's my we get some fire oh man I remember back in uh when this [ __ ] was new before there was lab testing and a lot of logic used and there was a lot just dumb [ __ ] where people was like look if it makes butane come from the sky and land back into your already first oil and dumb stupid [ __ ] like that and there was people just I mentioned earlier I said people think the only volatile thing that's in that mixture of 400 different [ __ ] compounds or more they think the only volatile thing there is a butane when all the Terps are [ __ ] aromatic hydrocarbons which are [ __ ] flammable so there's so much [ __ ] that is you know ignite that we do extract from weed yeah my favorite thing about these ceramic nails is that you get them [ __ ] your hit is the same every time we get them brand [ __ ] new every dev you get a brand new and [ __ ] and it's not like an unseasoned taste I mean it's not we're not dabbing on titanium so you're not gonna get that but ceramic I mean you do get a burnt down case if your dad too hot like if I'd out in the next book in 30 or 40 seconds I'm not going to be enjoying it to him yeah I was watching those Mexican kids down in Texas the skate will get a major crew I found I mean I think it was when Josh Katz I did a shout out I was when I found him or maybe it was the foot no it was that Hannah Montana skating video when the Halloween last year one got popular there nice [ __ ] rip that that inspired me to get on a skateboard yesterday and hurt myself smashed my balls a couple times so that was fun yeah but I think we're good Cheers that's one [ __ ] that yeah I brought home some the first lab I'm bringing that back that woman is the [ __ ] who had to take a walk for that speaking of my smartass assistant this is still here people were clipping I think and snow had something to do with it nope snow cap was in this bag like a [ __ ] here ago oh you'd like cuz he knows I know that hydrocarbons is like the main structures that I [ __ ] enough so he drew a propane molecule right there just stick show me how why it's nonpolar you mean why different [ __ ] tonight and I pretty much already forgot most of the [ __ ] they showed me but he kept trying all these different [ __ ] molecules like water I mean like Gaddy that's totally Mickey Mouse [ __ ] water molecule second came out pretty tomato hydrochloric acid and then he made um acetic acid which was I think in vinegar or is vinegar some [ __ ] like that and then he made I think not methane but there's something he made something so that was cool give me one laughs look at that selfie slab no you saw how I pull the slab out of the oven looking probably like most Year guys at slabs and I flipped it over one last time and did that and now it looks like this so that's how you do it in case you were wondering I'm gonna get the packaging now so I hope you guys enjoyed this video peace", "dTETBUOM_Gg": "hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I am here today fresh after Christmas I guess it's a couple of days after Christmas the 27th hope you all had a wonderful holidays and enjoyed your time with your family I feel like a kid on Christmas morning because I have a new package from pure pressure in Colorado my favorite rosin press company and I'm hoping that this is either the helix or the helix Pro manual rosin press so I wanted to do an unboxing video with you guys I'm not sure if you're familiar with the helix Pro I can put the picture up here real quick it's the helix Pro is a 5 ton manual rosin press they are expected January 2019 so they're doing 25 pre-orders for this particular thing it's got bigger heat plates and more force than the helix it's exclusive preorder pricing as a thousand bucks down and then you know three weeks before shipping you can pay the rest of the the price I think it's another twenty nine hundred for this particular unit every pre-order comes with a free matching accessory kit and entry into their contest where one is going to win a second press for free for a friend or for yourself so top features user friendly and easy to twist press operation no air compressor required ultra accurate force measuring load cell which displays bag pressure in real time that's a market first for manual rosin press super responsive pressure control that allows for as little as 10 pound force increments press up to 12 grams of flowers or 20 grams of kefir hash at a time with ease features our press wear technology which offers a full-color LCD touchscreen with custom software for even more control you can save up to 29 preset recipes so once you dial in your settings you can repeat your results over and over and over again up to five tons of force which is ten thousand pounds of force output from our hundred percent custom engineered lead screw twist press technology these guys have put a lot of time and energy so trust me when I say these guys understand engineering and they really produce their rosin presses from an engineer's perspective that's how the machine is getting built even heat distribution from zero Fahrenheit to 300 Fahrenheit from our in-house machined aluminum plates each with its own thermocouple which is great temperature accuracy to less than one degree Fahrenheit ultra durable powder coated construction and of course their patent pending so I say we get started right away it was just such a pleasure when my long Peaks showed up I loved the way they shipped it I loved everything about how they packaged it it was just really quite a pleasure to open that package and I kind of have a feeling this one's not gonna be too too different crack off this lid see see what's inside just a little bit of papers so you've got your invoice got your invoice right there you've got rosin bag filters which is quite nice I'll take a photo of it and put it up on the screen so you can see about their press moulds they're specialized scraping tools you know the funnel kit the quick flip the bag sizes the screen sizes all of these different things are pretty pretty important to kind of know where you sit how rosin is pressed they have a really nice little folder which I will also photograph and put up on the screen so you can look at that and see the different screen sizes and from flower to Keith to bubble hash and the different tips for the different things and the consistencies and the textures these guys have really been doing a great job I gotta say working with them has an absolute pleasure so they also have a little card in there for the harvest rate pharmaceutical freeze dryer all right look at that here's the top right there be careful with our knife so it's gonna be somewhat careful when you're using a knife especially when you're opening a package that you don't know exactly how it's been shipped all right so these look like the little feet put those down over here there's four of them so that makes sense all right what else we got here yes this is the beat of the press I've seen these enough times to know these go on the side of the machine with the feet that screw into them so that should be easy enough to do while we're on the unboxing video let's just screw these right into here we'll go as much as we can I'm not sure how much we should leave but probably probably a little bit one two three four threads one two three four threads one two three four threads perfect that's the right height get the other one in here what I love about peer pressure is just the quality of the craftsmanship you know the idea that this came from a real engineering standpoint and they put a lot of thought into into putting this this unit together it is definitely not something that is fly by the pants seat of your pants construction they really do an incredible job I might actually cut this whole box away rather than try to lift out the press I think that is what I'm gonna do yeah we're gonna give you a little show on what's going on in here not sure exactly what all these components are because I've never seen this unit before so you're seeing it really for the first time with me here not sure which these guys are for oh yeah this is our little handle yeah that that little guy right there for cranking it on the top of the unit I like it I like it a lot and on to this one right here it's definitely not as heavy as I thought it might meet which is really nice this definitely goes down right on top boom just like that your handle gets inserted and then okay so the screws are actually right in the unit which is great I can take this off I like how easy this goes on and off and it doesn't seem to need to be locked in place which is very nice okay so I suspect these are gonna go like that there you can also put this unit like this so you can actually have it like this setup where it's sort of horizontal versus vertical so both options are there all right so I already got the one leg on what are the things with these guys that I make a bit of a mistake is they'll have a tiny little bend on their foot and naturally I'll think that the feet go to the outside this is actually the opposite of how it goes you can see the feet go in the unit builds up and there's three little allen keys right here in the side but are fairly easy to unscrew I could be using a drill in making easier but i'm using an allen key so be it and so i love the way the screws just come in in place in the machine you don't have to look for a little bag and try and find the screws it's quite easy you just go to where you're going to be screwing them in and they're already there so it's just a matter of removing them and then screwing them in to secure the feet and I guess that's done because the feet can go on a variety of ways the way they've got it set up you can put it vertical or horizontal so all right just get this up here threading is just really done well it's not gonna be problematic where your screws aren't aren't screwing in nicely or the going in sideways everything just lines up really really well on these units and I appreciate that about about them okay there we go little make sure they're tight on both sides yep yep yep boom look at that there it is right there it comes with a power cord got the same great digital screen and really left the little screen I like the look of this little unit I'm pretty excited about it alright so I figured we should do a little press I've got a little bit of canvas here it sounds like we can press a solid 12 grams of flour at a time on this little unit so we're gonna take the little flip tool that they have I've got the screen over top here this is a hundred and fifteen micron screen we're just gonna flip it inside out that's gonna get that seam on the inside for us and it will hold a lot less oil as you know contaminants capturing oil that we really would rather have release I've got my little funnel I'm going to put on my gloves so we've got our little bag we've got our little 12 grams of herb I am of course pressing my all-time favorite where is my bike just such a great flower to press as it truly really releases an incredible amount of resin so we'll go into there nice I've gone off about these tools before but I might as well a little bit again I just love the ease with which these tools operates I've got quite a bit of extra room it's definitely not going all the way to the top I'll have a nice little bit of screen I'll just be able to fold over I brought my pure pressure template here for pre pressing the pre press get that in there much better over there so we've got a nice flattened piece here this is the older one that I took from and then we have some papers so they sent me once again with some screens all sorts of varieties of screens here which I was very happy I'll be doing some experimenting including stainless steel screens right there send me some stickers which I will be giving away to some folks all right so oh man oh they even sent me a new see that so let's get this opened up and access some of this paper I wondered why this paper was a little smaller than the parchment that I'm used to but I get it makes very good sense in the sense that we're using a much smaller press so too will we be using much smaller paper so I think first things first because we're not ready to press yet let's hit the switch on this little boy this bad boy will see the screen line up probably come over to the side here a little bit and you turn it okay please remove force from press then press okay all right let's remove force from press okay ah there we go so it opens up the same old LED screen that I'm used to and know and love it's giving me my force it's got system settings it's got recipes it's got a quick press it's got run recipe it's about last run data so I say we go into recipes I have merely turned the heaters on here and here I've got my settings at 220 Fahrenheit which for the you know recipe that we're gonna be running is gonna work fine for me let's go back to home let's go back to recipes and let's go back to this one so this one edit recipe name set material type well restarted it again that's interesting well let's you know what let's do it so we'll go select flour select bag size okay so it's adding that the weight based on bag side it's got the temperatures it's got my pressures alright so I'll just go run and then I have to push start press when we're actually ready to do this and I'll be turning this little guy to to check out how how well it works so very very cool little unit these guys do such a great job it's got a little drip tray for those of you that didn't know what this was it's loose weight now was playing around with it now I'm gonna hold the camera but I love the idea of a drip tray I have to admit there we go because these sides I've had parchment absolutely drip down inside the machine on my long Peaks so this is a very nice little unit right here this little drip tray it comes in and out very easy you can lift it right out if you don't want to use it and it's just a matter of actually opening up the press a little bit which happens very easy with a little bit of twisting and this just pops right out so that's our little tray right there I also found out that these particular guys are obviously clamps and what they are for is to clamp the unit down to any table that you're working on if need be if you're really cranking away at this thing so I'm going to use the drip tray you can put it down over this way because that's where the wiring is I'll fit that a nice and carefully there you go perfect alright so we'll wait for these to heat up it's already at 105 degrees potentially oh look at that it even came with magnets these guys are on the ball you can keep that on it's quite a bit of parchment coming off the back which is never a problem for me because I love when I have a real squisher to be able to have that little bit of back room for the oil to escape into so very excited 12 gram runs obviously this is a lot smaller than I'm used to doing I'm used to doing 35 to 40 gram runs a flower and even high - but who knows this is like a real nice little small unit I can carry it around with me and I suspect I could get this thing to fit into a pelican case which means adventures in rosin making how fun would it be to take the bubble bags and the dry set of screens and the rosin press up to the ice cave on the parrots and ice caps and bust out some high quality and that is what's up so we are at a hundred and thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit not too bad both sixty to eighty degrees away from the temperature that we're looking at and as you can see there are important components to getting this you know to making this easy to making it you know less difficult and difficult and that's about having all of the proper tools make sure you have your bags okay what do I have the bags I have some 90 microns I have some 36 microns I have some 72 microns and I have some hundred and fifteen microns so for different sized bags most of these bearings are used for flour 36 micronized use for hash we've got the template for pressing we've got our funnels which I can put the dirty ones in here as well as our flipper unit which is very key and then we've got our our bags our parchment paper so that's also very important just kind of getting all this stuff out of here that's pretty cool the way you can the way you can you know basically attach these two to a table and it's it's not very difficult to do is it you're just gonna try maybe one while we're sitting here tables not queue wide but definitely wide enough that it's there's that one other one of those little doctors not sure this so that's actually a really good idea I'm sure once you get you know moving on this thing you could get a little excited depending on who you are you could start moving the whole unit and that's not really gonna be an ideal situation so when the screen gets put in properly and doesn't doesn't come out because then we end up with with a fair bit of screen contaminant and a plate nice to be able to put my finger in there or not worry about the whole press squishing it and crushing it that's very nice okay so let's go start press stage one yeah so we're at 729 pounds we're at a thousand 1,100 forces at 2,800 okay forces at 4600 let's see if we can turn a little bit and I can start seeing the oil coming out now I can see quite a bit of oil coming up the sides here is buttering up nicely here and it's that it's that some good force right little close up what we got going on here there we go without our percentage we got 8,000 pounds of force I like the drip tray I do indeed like the drip tray and you can also see around back here that it's also starting to push rosin up through the back and it looks like it's wanting to butter up right away and that generally is what happens with very high THC product it was only 12 grams so I'm hoping for at least 3 grams of rosin that would be maybe even a little bit more for this particular strain cultivar cycle complete let's stop the press and we'll open this up it really only gets a little bit tough at the end alright let's go around and see what we got here [Music] here we go for our yield so I'm gonna collect that up and I'll let you guys know what it is in one second here pretty exciting alright so I have crushed out the first and second press I did end up getting just over 3 grams which I guess would probably be around 26% 27% so I left up a little bit behind from what I normally get with my long Peaks keep in mind this is my first press with this unit I didn't really understand exactly how to set it up so I'm pretty sure in the next week or two I'll get that 2% back certainly not upset with it that's for sure three solid grams really caramel beautiful where's my bike flour rosin I gotta say so far the first experience with the helix Pro has been really cool I did also figure out both of these how they actually go on as they go between the wheel and the foot so they go kind of like that underneath and so that's why they don't need to be different sides they both work perfectly and I will set it up next time better with the with the clamps because once you get it listen the first when you're closing it and opening it opens really easy as you get to around 5 6,000 7,000 8,000 pounds per pressure it starts getting a little bit harder and I can see for sure how you could move the whole press so I'm going to thank you all for tuning in you're gonna see a lot more happening with this press we're gonna do a whole video and actually using this press with flour dry sift and bubble hash I just really wanted to do an unboxing video today and I thought what a great way to do an unboxing video to also show a really quick press so thank you to the people the the group over at peer pressure the team if you will I look forward to seeing you all at lyft in January January 11th to 13th or 14th I believe here in Vancouver these guys peer pressure coming out and we'll have a booth you could probably find me at their booth otherwise I would be walking around with my team from embark if you see me there definitely pull me aside and say hello and great great little unit super quality I mean once you see this unit in person and you feel the quality of the tools you really get the idea very quickly this is a solid unit so thanks a lot peer pressure thanks everyone for watching and we'll see you next time on [Music]", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "ZLzvApa7uOI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today we're going to be talking about the baker's dozen this is the frozen this is the frozen I should say that most of the violin is professional violinist are you know looking to buy it and honestly you guys it's it's impossible nearly impossible to get it especially these days so yeah let me talk you through this I have two kinds of the baker's resin I'll give you possibly all the information I have and yeah let's start it alright so I was able to get this resin after waiting for nearly two or three years on the waiting list I was able to get it to roughly a year ago so I have been using it for yeah for pretty much like a year or so as I can really give you my honest opinion I do have two kinds he makes two kinds Rosen's this is the original which has like a purple kind of a brownish stamp and then the green stamp this is the the French version so this is more Italian I'll say he described it as a original Cremonese recipe and this is more after French which is the V own he call it V own sea trout or something like that so there by the way they are made in England and this is a very bakers is a very small company that it's owned by you know it's a family-owned company and basically they make this resin once a year they described on their website during the hottest months on it assume it's during the summer this is where they can get the best fresh sucks you know from the trees and they basically cook it right away the port or fresh so this is like probably the only one in the world that makes a company that makes resin - fresh from like a fresh liquid SAP so the resins Kames beautifully packaged you know they also included like like a little piece of paper which looks like a very kind of old paper with the information about each rosin and I thought it was really really cute looking obviously they were all sealed nicely so the first resin that comes with this kind of a brownish a little stamp and so take a wax stamp would be you know on the top four bakers so the first one is the original and obviously on those Scrolls you have a little information about the rosin so I'm just gonna quickly read a couple of info because I think it's quite helpful to know so the Baker's original is a hundred percent a handmade based on an authentic Ramona recipe dating back to the time of Paganini so you know he claims this is the original recipe recipe and unlike many products this rosin is made from a fresh liquid SAP so if you're not familiar with the resins like usually resins you know that whoever makes the resin the resin makers they buy a SAP which is comes in the solid and then they kind of melt and you know two older magic and they make the resin so baker's resin is made of the liquid SAP so he's basically doing right away so you know the this obviously is resulting in a superior resin and fresh or product so it's a hundred percent natural and the highest quiet quality you can imagine so the reason this resin you guys is so difficult to to get and so hard to get is basically it's because it's a seasonal product and they can just only make so many of that resin and I believe they put you once you get it they put you on the list and I believe you can buy it every two years they send you email you know here's your fresh frozen would you like to buy it as far as I know you guys I'm gonna leave his website down below anyway but as far as I know the list the website is like closed for a new customer I know it's not gonna be really helpful but you know you can you know look into it for the future and see you know maybe they won't reopen the new customer list and you know hopefully you can get on it but ya expect to wait a couple of years because you know like I said I waited a few years for this rosin so anyway so this is the original rosin and it's beautiful you guys I mean look at this eye you can obviously tell that I use it quite a bit during this past year so this has this original Rosa has like a little like kind of like an ember you know outside color so it's a little bit darker than the young rosin so this is the original the second recipe comes with the same packaging but it has a little bit like a green kind of a wax stamp again with the letter B on top this resin in accordance to his information this is the Baker's young Citroen is created but hint from a traditional French recipe which was popular a wonder Lyon was alive so again it's made of the fresh liquid SAP and yep in this result this resin is highly reactive to players input and capable of a broad range of tonal variations so this rosin is lighter in color as you can see from the original one so this is the French recipe and the other one is what Paganini was Italian so Cremona I guess it's Italian recipe so this is this is basically the only two resins you can get from him this is what he specialized in so before I will tell you what I think about those resins I did record a little sound sample and just I'm gonna insert it now so you can go ahead and listen and just think about it like can you hear the difference alright so you can see both of them and just tell me if you can hear the difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so could you hear a difference because I couldn't if I listen to this recording to me it sounds exactly the same I did use two different bells they were all clean so I had a fresh you know rosin on on each of the bows now I even when I play it you guys I couldn't tell much of the difference between one and the other formula maybe I like the original a little bit better than the French recipe but there is really very little difference and honestly it all is gonna come down to your personal preference okay now let me talk about the price a little bit because knowing that this is so hard to find you would think that this resin is gonna cost a fortune because if you're familiar with the curent resins they're on the market some of them can be extremely extremely expensive and to my surprise a year ago I paid about $25 for each US dollars for each resins that cost me $50 or something like that $50 for two Rosen's I think it's extremely inexpensive considering how much work you know he put into it so the price point of this rosin is just there it's perfect like I mentioned my personal preference if I will have to choose for life just one I probably would go with the original and then this would be my second choice but honestly you guys those two are equally equally very very good resins I would agree with the claims that has a very low low dust you know which is good especially for those who are allergic those people who are allergic you know even when you rosin about you know there's very little rosin dust coming out and also very little rosin dust is accumulating on top of the violin which is good these are super smooth you know very but they can be quite crispy if you need to you know it's it's obviously depend of your technical abilities of your you know obviously your right hand has a lot to do you know with that articulation but I found this roses to be really really good I have no any complaints whatsoever the question is is this resin the best rosin in the world considering the fact how difficult is to get and you know although obviously all the claims I don't know if this is the best or is this as the only one because I own quite a few resins you guys and I compare this resin to my other resins and honestly I think they are all beautiful you know and I'm talking about you know more expensive resins you know let's say the leather bespoke rosin from Australia that cost twice as much probably as this or even more and yeah I feel like that rosin is equally as amazing as this so it's very hard to tell you guys I'm just being completely honest with you so if I'll have to you know just choose one rosin for life I don't have extremely hard time because and I'm by the way I'm gonna do the video if you want me to do it give it a thumbs up on my top top five favorite resins let me know if you wanna hear that video so um yeah I think at the end of the day all of it comes to your personal preference what do you like there even you guys I'm getting so kind of picky because for certain pieces for certain about I'll use it different resins so I'm talking about like I'm going to the next level this is not necessary because I feel like one one of those rosin would be perfect for you know playing any piece yeah is this the only one is this the best yes and no I mean it's your personal preference it's exactly what you like exactly what you believe in exactly what it sounds good to you how much a good sound you can take out of this you know how much the rosin is really helping you with creating a beautiful sound articulation and all of it so I think it's a really personal preference at the end of the day and I would highly recommend to get it if you can if you can be lucky enough to get this yes go for it try it for yourself especially that it's not you know that expensive and you're not gonna be disappointed for sure but at the same time I don't want you to feel that you must have this rosin because this is the only resin that you're gonna be happy and satisfied with so there we go yeah I'm pretty sure you can buy you know different resins and be equally happy and satisfied you know using this so there we go guys so this is exactly what I think about this no complaints whatsoever it's a beautiful resin I will leave mr. Baker's website down below although I read just recently he's not taking any new customer so I'm sorry for that you guys but if you do get a chance to get you know this resin just try it it doesn't hurt it's a great resin and I'm sure you're gonna be very happy alright guys thank you so much for watching if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe give it a thumbs up if you like this

in the world up and just smoke chew and Julie scenery the view you know where'd you go oh this would have been a tough question like an hour ago but I I was just thinking about that actually it's kind of weird but the aurora borealis anywhere where I can see that I know there's a lot of countries in Europe or just like northern country you can probably see it in like Sweden and there's like a whole bunch of like Greenland Iceland I don't know I want to go roll up a nice fat joint and watch the aurora borealis and trip my mind maybe drop a little tab maybe I don't know probably if we're gonna be honest if I'm over there then yeah I'm probably gonna drop down the southern lights look pretty sick to you no one talks about that underrated but I mean the Northern Lights bro they're all green and [ __ ] like come on you know you trip balls looking at that yeah so this is an easy one I forgot your name what you're saying Mitch Mitch yeah all right this is an easy one man said it before I'll say it again I just balanced my [ __ ] by smoking after I'm done with all my important stuff so usually I'll wake up I'll go to school answer emails do all that stuff pretty sober and then once like the business day ends you know like 5:00 p.m. type [ __ ] then I'm just like all right [ __ ] off and I already streamed before that I start my stream every day at 3:30 so it's just like I'm kind of clocked out by that time I make sure I have nothing else like the main thing that I make sure of is that if I were to just smoke too much and pass out I wouldn't be irresponsible you know I wouldn't miss any deadlines or oh of course I just realized it was it was in 1080 man that's the worst anyway just make sure that if you get too high it's gonna be alright you can just Joe and be high cuz that's the worst thing to like when you're high and you're getting high and you remember that you have like homework you do or have to like edit a bit or upload a vid or I do this and then it's just like dams it's kind of like a buzzkill on the hunt you know I mean like I like a stress-free just chill chill high and if I have things to worry about and it's not gonna happen yo my name is Daniel and my question is what is your favorite strain right now right now yesterday right now oh shoot right now purple punch it's green it was Green crack for a while everyone the real fans know like bro Green Craig been your favorite for a while would happen purple punch man when you get the purple punch bud if you ever had some purple punch extracts like I had some lunch time as dude almost came like I almost like came soft that wasn't even hard or anything like I just [ __ ] almost came my pants but hey it was ridiculous so far but I'm Eric - Patrick I want to know the shirtless big come on bro Stan how long can I do a keg stand bro I don't have everyday cakes in my life I got shot gonna be real nice I can beer bong it'd be real nice I've never done a cake set man I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] for that hey we'll get a cake Sancerre don't even worry about all right now that you put it in my mind I've actually never done any kicks in so I got you bro you were what session was probably the 42 grand moon rock even though that wasn't really one session if you don't want to count that that is probably the hounds in one sitting either one of them those that's I don't mean that that's a lot bro I don't really like blow down too hard like everyone gives me this leg this [ __ ] they're like bro I smoke like Suge like maybe you do bro I spent like two grams a day like including the stream to three grams a day probably like it's not that much I mean yeah smoking every day's a lot but I am 100% sure that there is a decent amount of you that smoke more than me I'm not worried but it isn't a competition bro like I've never been like dude I've smoked way more than that guy like that's just some some little dick [ __ ] right there man that is some little deed confidence right there what's up [ __ ] yeah appreciate that chase why did I start smoking honestly all my friends started smoking before me and I didn't really want to try it because like I heard all the [ __ ] in middle school was like you don't do drugs don't smoke weed like dude not do any of these things stay away from it her different parents are teachers counselors everybody so I was like of course I'm not gonna get involved my friends want to get involved they can't I'm not gonna stop him you know what I mean but as I kept hanging out with him I was like they're not really negatively effected like all these things that I thought was gonna happen to him like none of them happened there was still just who they were and they were just hi and I was like dude if I was like they can just be high and still be functional still do good in school still work their jobs or whatever and I was like I'm down so tried it out summer going into sophomore year of high school and it was a good time than it was and I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all it's giving me a good vibe let's smoke some weed from now on and then the rest is history bro you already know what it is you know Eric your Inlet yo what's up Eric my name is Travis and my question is would you ever give up smoking for a job and if you would what John would have to be like that answer is so much different now than it was a year ago because like this this weed tube [ __ ] in like this this whole thing is actually leading stuff like a meeting companies that meeting all these people that are willing to give me jobs and it's like I don't think I'm gonna have to man but but let's just say all of it falls through let's say [ __ ] tomorrow Trump's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you pot heads no more weed it all makes it federal again schedule one keeps it and it's just like completely [ __ ] then in that case I would give up smoking weed for a job that's like six figures probably like above yeah yeah that's like a comfortable living you know what I mean like I don't need to be a millionaire or anything but if I'm given a weed it's gotta be worth it you know what I mean it's not gonna be hard to give up like I don't think I'm gonna smoke weed forever if we're gonna be a hundred percent real like I think I'm probably gonna stop or at least take a break when I have a kid but like until then bro do you I'm not having a kid for like another decade so until then we're smoking this [ __ ] but like I don't think I'm gonna smoke it forever I'm not gonna wanna maybe when the kids a little older then I started like I don't know man the futures trippy to think about like I genuinely don't even know what the [ __ ] gonna happen in like a year that's like a asking like what are you gonna have for dinner tomorrow night but anyway I think it's pretty much done yeah that's done um that's [ __ ] gross all right appreciate you guys for coming through you guys are the absolute best 300k I love you all so so much you're all the homies man this is our year I told you 2019 was our year and everyone was like dude I mean no one really

youtube we are at the brand new grow healthy location in sarasota and i just dropped about 300 bucks on all here jasmine hooked it up and we got an ounce of some flour and a couple grams of some concentrate so i'm really excited to check out grow healthy i haven't had the flour yet so i'm really excited and let's grab something delicious to drink for the weekend and i think we're gonna get this is one of my favorites all right my dudes let's take a closer look at everything we were able to get from grow healthy today they had some decent options and i really like that flower i was able to pick up a half ounce of this mine bird this is their littles it's not the best looking but it was 65 for the half ounce with the discount so really good deal there i also got some of their key largo some of the stuff's a little bit leafy but it smells really good i also got some bubba kush here's one of my one of my favorites it's a classic strain everybody likes bubba and we also got some star dog this is one of the better ones here but take a look at the queso pero i think this is the best flower i think it was the highest percentage they had in there i wasn't really looking for that but it's also the nicest looking buds i scooped their last gram of rosin it's the last one smells so good i'm stoked to try it and then i also got a couple half grams of some distillate and we're gonna take a look at these all right let's heat up a dab of this big pine tea lime rosin and before we dab just so you guys know we now have memberships available on the channel you can support the channel for as low as 99 cents check out that join [Music] button oh buddy uh where's my water at oh man this is so [ __ ] nice oh man this is good oh man that rosin is really good it's nice to have more dispensaries open up i think since i've moved here there's at least three or four new ones within a 10 mile 15 mile radius or so so it's nice to be able to go to more places have more options because that means better chances at deals one shop doesn't have a concentrated deal call the next one they don't have to check the next one so very nice to have more dispensary options overall that helps to bring the price down and increase the options because they're all going to be trying to compete with what do they have what do they have all right let's take a hit of their birds of paradise i did get the littles which is normally 99 for the half ounce that's a pretty good deal but i got it for 65 today [Music] oh yeah that was not bad i might hit some more flour here i've actually been out for a few days so it's nice to get a hold of some as much as i like dabs something about bong rips it always gets me damn oh yeah yeah yeah we're gonna get high oh man i just smoked so much and i wasn't recording i thought we were i just did the whole end of my video and everything and i look over to click stop and it says start anyway let's get high again the svog is pretty good dang i really can't believe i didn't record that oh man this thing is cloudy well dang don't forget to smash that like button and subscribe if you want to see more dispensary hauls overall i would say it's a pretty good haul they were passing out t-shirts because it was the grand opening the staff was really friendly i said yo can i film my intro in here real quick they said sure and they had a decent selection overall i really like their flower all of it smells really good but don't forget to check out my other social media i have all the links in the description below and i'm getting ready to go live on twitch right now i'm super hot but thanks for watching thanks for hanging out and i hope you have a lit day", "A0hZd1ueLtg": "hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for

you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for

of there you know it's not hard to always work with excellent material if you supply yourself which you should be doing if you're a processor no processor should go into business relying on other people to keep this business afloat you should go into business being able to sustain yourself 100 if you can't you're in the wrong industry you shouldn't be hashing you shouldn't be processing okay my two cents on the mata fire fire isn't it settled so nice no loss when this settles i'll have a nice little muffin let me grab a jar [Music] ah all right so real quick i'm gonna weigh this and then

finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't

google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me

stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was
